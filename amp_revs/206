0, Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp with the optional Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage With that option the cost is Â£197900 excluding VAT This translates into US 2554 The unit was purchased new and drop shipped to me by a kind member I had previously measured the reference design from Purifi so will be good to see how this version rates with a different input stageThe Nord dual monoblock comes in a very attractive enclosure Efficiency of class D amplifiers and switchmode power supply enables such slim case to be used There are two rows of heatsinks on the sides but they are decorative for the most part I will do a teardown separately For now the amplifiers dissipate heat into the bottom of the chassis and dual power supplies have their own heatsinks inside the boxThe back panel shows seriously beefy and nice feeling speaker connectorsWhen I received the unit it immediately shut down The reason was a blown fuse I replaced it with a spare that comes in the IEC holder That worked for all but my last test which is the strenuous power vs frequency I have let Colin know that I think the fuse amperage needs to be increased given our low operating voltage in US Note that with music you are not going to hit this easily so it is more of an issue of labstress testing I dont have a higher amp fuse to try with it until a batch arrives on Monday The fuse is the smaller 5x25mm which I only have a few of in low amperage Edit turns out the fuse that was sent for was for 240 volt countries A sloblow 10 amp replacement fuse was sent and worked fineOther than this the amplifier was solid in its performance never shutting down or complaining The enclosure didnt even get warmer than room temperature Inclusion of two power supplies here relieves my worry of a the power supply being the weak link not the amplifierAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 Ohm at 1 kHzThis is right on the money as far as THDN and hence SINADWhich is great news of courseNoise performance also matched the Purifi reference designWe have a very low distortion and very low noise floor This is all that you would want to ask an amplifier That and power so lets see how it does thereDual power supplies dont give you more power as we are essentially matching the reference design with one power supplyI was surprised to see a rise in distortion with one channel worse than the other Is this the Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage in play or were we given better evaluation samples at announcement We wont know until we test another amp that uses Purifi gain stageSame issue exists at 8 ohm although not as exaggeratedThis makes me think the issue may be in the amplifierNote that this is not an audible concern so dont jump off the cliff please We see an exaggerated version of the same in intermodulation distortion relative to input levelFrequency response is flat and similar to reference designSweeps of power versus frequency gives us varying curves We see that at 20 Hz where we need most power we have least amount of it This is typical of amplifiers since 20 Hz tone changes slowly not giving a chance for power supply capacitors to recharge between cyclesFinally here is the 1920 kHz at the same 5 watt power of Purifi reference designThe pair around the main tone are identical to reference design Noise floor is a hair higher but that is probably run to run variationConclusionsThe Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp is an attractive build of the Purifi class D amplifier technology The dual mono configuration raises the price fair but but my belief is that it will last a lot longer than the single power supply version Measured performance is just a bit worse than Purifi reference design as power increases beyond 25 watts or so Not an audible difference but would be good to figure out where this is coming from I cant detect any improvement from Sonic Imagery discrete 990enh opamps So personally I would go with the stock gain stage and save enough money for a night out aloneI am happy to recommend the Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amplifier It builds on stateoftheart Purifi amplifier modules and delivers it in nice packaging As always questions comments corrections etc are welcomeThe Pink Panthers are making up their Christmas list and I can tell you it is going to be a long long list The have become sophisticated enough to create their lists on Amazon One has been daring enough ot put in Caviar for heavens sake I am going to need money and lots of it So please donate generously using
