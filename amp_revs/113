0, twochannel version of the Emotiva XPA Gen3   s I ran it at 100Wpc into 8 ohms for an hour  At the end of that time the louvers on the top panel above the two circuit boards were hot at 1344°F  though the rest of the exterior case was cooler This may be an inexpensive amplifier but it has adequate heatsinking for its power rating though this might be due to the fact that the case can hold up to seven amplification modules rather than the two of our review sampleThe gain at the loudspeaker terminals for both balanced and unbalanced inputs was 294dB and while the output preserved absolute polarity  for the unbalanced input the balanced input inverted polarity suggesting that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 cold the opposite of the modern convention The balanced input impedance was moderately high at 275k ohms the unbalanced input impedance was 145k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to 95k ohms at the top of the audiobandThe output impedance including the series resistance of the speaker cables I used was very low at 20Hz and 1kHz at 009 ohm and rose only slightly at 20kHz to 0125 ohm As a result the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by just ±01dB  Fig1 shows that the response into 8 ohms  starts to roll off at the top of the audioband with the output reaching –03dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 70kHz The response rolled off only slightly earlier into lower impedances reaching –05dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  The Emotivas reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was very good  with no overshoot or ringingFig1 Emotiva XPA Gen3 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Emotiva XPA Gen3 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was good rather than great at 75dB or so from 20Hz to 5kHz decreasing slightly to 67dB at the top of the audioband The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground was good at 705dB left and 693dB right both ratios ref 1W into 8 ohms Limiting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these respective ratios to a superb 95 and 939dB while an Aweighting filter offered further improvement to 99 and 98dB The spectrum of the XPA Gen3s lowfrequency noise floor while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms is shown in fig3 Other than some very lowlevel spuriae at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics in the left channel the XPAs noise floor is very cleanFig3 Emotiva XPA Gen3 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Specified as delivering 300Wpc into 8 ohms  or 550Wpc into 4 ohms  the XPA Gen3 clipped at 315Wpc into 8 ohms   and at 520Wpc into 4 ohms   both readings taken with both channels driven Looking at how the percentage of THDnoise varied with frequency at a moderately high level  the THDN remained low at low and middle frequencies and was even slightly lower in the low treble  However as can be seen in this graph the percentage starts to rise in the midtreble before climbing precipitously above 15kHz exceeding 1 at 20kHz All I can think of to explain this behavior is that the circuit has limited openloop bandwidth meaning that there is insufficient corrective negative feedback available at the top of the audiobandFig4 Emotiva XPA Gen3 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Emotiva XPA Gen3 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Emotiva XPA Gen3 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms At lower frequencies and moderate powers the distortion signature is predominantly the third harmonic  Though they cant be seen in the graph there are small spikes surrounding each positive and negative waveform peak ie four per cycle that could be seen on an analog scope I have no idea where these spikes come from unless they are related to the classH voltage rail switching At high powers the third harmonic is joined by higherorder odd harmonics as well as by the second and fourth harmonics  though these are all very low in levelFig7 Emotiva XPA Gen3 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00082 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Emotiva XPA Gen3 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms I usually test an amplifier for intermodulation distortion by driving it at a high power with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones which is very much the worst case Given the dramatic rise in THD at the top of the audioband in fig6 I was not surprised to find that the Emotiva XPA Gen3 did very poorly on this test Fig9 reveals a picket fence of intermodulation products with the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lying at –33dB  ref the waveforms peak level Reducing the level to 1W  eliminated the difference product but many higherorder intermodulation products are still present the highest in level lying at –66dB  I repeated the 100W test with an equal mix of tones and octave lower  though highorder intermodulation products can still be seen these all now lie at or below –80dB Fig9 Emotiva XPA Gen3 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms Fig10 Emotiva XPA Gen3 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms Fig11 Emotiva XPA Gen3 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 910kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms Emotivas XPA Gen3 amplifier offers high powers with low levels of noise and distortion at least at frequencies below 10kHz at a very affordable price But the amplifiers problems at the top of the audioband bother me Predicting the subjective effect of this objective behavior is probably an exercise in futility but I do wonder if it correlates with Herbs finding that the Emotiva sounded hard and 100 masculine through two of the speakers he tried with it
