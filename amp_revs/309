0, of OptomaNuForce STA200 Power Amplifier I see it listed for USD 499 including Prime shipping Looking elsewhere it appears to have a list price of 1299This is one attractive enclosure that does not usually come in a 500 packageThe finish is slightly textured and looks pretty niceFeature wise there is nothing there but a set of RCA inputs and speakers The RCA inputs are paired with speaker terminals on each end of the unit so you better have RCA cables that separate that muchSomewhat out of character is a traditional extruded aluminum heatsink poking out the back  I guess this avoids having to put the heatsink inside and having to vent the enclosure The heatsink is pretty small though and it was cooking even when testing the unit at just 5 wattschannel I worry about its ability to run OK at full power for any extended amount of timeRated power is 80 wattschannel with 8 ohm load My testing was at 4 ohm howeverLets get into measurements and see how she doesMeasurementsAs with my previous amplifier tests lets start with a dashboard view of the unit while it was outputting 5 wattsBoy this is disappointing We have tons of mains and power supply components  The dominant distortion components are the cause of poor SINAD though with the second harmonic peaking up to nearly 70 dB So even if the rest were not there the SINAD would remain the sameCompany states THDN of  003 and we are essentially there so our testing is correct The writeup brags about response up to 1 Mhz and such I suspect instead of using fair amount of feedback to bring the distortion down they have traded for wider bandwidth Looking at the power rating versus distortion the STA200 doesnt bring much to the party over the much cheaper Topping TP60 Yes there is less noise at lower power levels but by the time we get to 1 watt they equalize in performance and at limit the Topping TP60  actually has less distortionThe spec says the signal to noise ratio is 100 dB My measurements fall somewhat short of thatLikely the mains intrusion is the cause Sweeping input level and measuring IMD we getAs with THD the STA200 has good bit less noise than Topping TP60 but then suddenly clips and clips badly Looking at the gain we see whyThis is a lot of gain for a low power amplifier No wonder sensitivity is speced at just 045 volt  This means if you may have to significantly turn down the volume in your preampdacpre This would make for an amp that plays loud due to its high gain and perhaps that is a conscious choiceFrequency response is reasonable to 40 kHz Anyway I think we have enough here to know the merits of this amplifierConclusionsI was pretty depressed when I reviewed the Topping TP60 and FX Audio FX502SPro and had high hopes that the NuForce STA200 would easily outperform them Such was not the case The Topping TP60 at less than half the price essentially matches its performance It also runs substantially cooler than this unit It doesnt look quite as nice though although it has a more manageable desktop form factor if that is how you use itThe NuForce ST200 seems to cater the audiophile myth of fast and highbandwidth amplifiers sacrificing fidelity to get there This is a poor trade off in my book when just about all the content we play is quite band limited
