0, Bel Canto e1X   As the Bel Canto is a classD design it wasnt necessary to precondition the amplifier by using it to drive a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms Nevertheless before doing any testing I ran it for an hour at a moderate power level to ensure that it was fully warmed up Because classD amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slewrate limiting all  with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz Without the filter there was 398mV of ultrasonic noise present at the loudspeaker terminalsThe voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was the specified 27dB from both the balanced and singleended inputs Internal switches should increase the gain by 6dB I measured 51dB  The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  from both sets of inputs The singleended input impedance measured the specified 10k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping very slightly to 92k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was exactly twice these values again as specifiedThe Bel Cantos output impedance including the series impedance of 6 of loudspeaker cable was a very low 006 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing very slightly to 007 ohm at 20kHz The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore minuscule at ±01dB  The response into resistive loads was flat to 10kHz into 8 ohms then down by 06dB at 20kHz and 3dB at 38kHz  The restricted ultrasonic response is responsible for slightly lengthened risetimes with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  There is also a faint hint of overshoot with the Bel Cantos squarewave response this presumably due to the classD output stages integral lowpass filterFig1 Bel Canto e1x frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Bel Canto e1x smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was superb at 105dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 82dB at 20kHz With the Audio Precision ultrasonic filter the gain set to 27dB and the analog inputs shorted to ground the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured 737dB in the left channel and 714dB in the right Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 908dB left and 855dB right and an Aweighting filter increased it further to an excellent 100dB in both channels Spectral analysis of the Bel Cantos lowfrequency noise floor  revealed spuriae related to the AC powerline frequency to be very low in levelFig3 Bel Canto e1x spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The e1X is specified as delivering a maximum output power at 1 THDnoise of 250Wpc into 8 ohms and 500Wpc into 4 ohms3 both equivalent to 24dBW  I found that the Bel Canto amplifier easily exceeded its specified power clipping at 340Wpc into 8 ohms  and at 530Wpc into 4 ohms  both powers at 1 THDnoiseFig4 Bel Canto e1x distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Bel Canto e1x distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsDistortion levels in the bass and midrange were low  and didnt increase by much into 2 ohms  The THD was higher in the treble especially into lower impedances  The shape of the THDN spuriae waveform at a moderate power into 8 ohms  suggests that the distortion signature is primarily third harmonic in nature though spectral analysis reveals that the second harmonic is also present at a slightly lower level  Higherorder harmonics all lie below –110dB  Into lower impedances  the second harmonic rises to the same level as the third but at –90dB  neither will have any effect on the amplifiers sound Despite the rise in THD in the top audio octaves intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones was very low even at high powers into 4 ohms Fig6 Bel Canto e1x THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms Fig7 Bel Canto e1x 1kHz waveform at 30W into 8 ohms 00035 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Bel Canto e1x spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50Wpc into 8 ohms Fig9 Bel Canto e1x HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms Bel Cantos e1X performed well on the test bench Footnote 1 Our dBW figures follow the convention established by Martin Colloms and the late Peter W Mitchell in the 1980s they are referred to 283V  Thus an amplifier that behaves as a perfect voltage source  offers the same dBW rating into all loads an easier paradigm to grasp than having to remember to add 3dB every time the load impedance halves
