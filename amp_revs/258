0, AIYIMA A07 desktop amplifier based on TPA3255 class D amplifier chip   drop shipped to me The cost is US 72 on Amazon including prime shipping And as of this shipping it also included a 32 volt 5 amp switching power supply Member also purchased and sent me a 48 volt3 amp power supply which I also testedThe case is standard budget audio affairThe volume control feels cheep but does the job The back panel terminals were way too small for my binding postsThe DC input socket was quite stiff especially with the 48 volt power supply Tightness is not a bad thing as far as power transfer is concerned but this was a bit too stiff Here are the two power suppliesThey both feel kind of cheap as they would be at these prices  Personally I would not leave these plugged in permanently if I am not around The included power supply has a twopronged AC cable that was not polarized Rotating it around made a small difference in mains leakageAIYIMA A07 MeasurementsLets start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohmsAs you see in the FFT display there is considerable amount of mains leakage at 60 Hz This tends to be a function of switching power supplies I played with grounding and improved it a lot in one channel but not in the other  SINAD did not get impacted since it is bound by distortion harmonics As it is performance is above averageSignal to noise ratio is not great due to the mains humFrequency response is well behaved albeit with a slight droop at 20 kHzCrosstalk is good and well above bargain basement desktop ampsPower is everything in a small amp so lets see how we do with 4 ohm loadAs expected with low impedance of 4 ohm we are current limited so the 5 amp stock power supply does better turning in 77 watts Yes the 300 watt rating is a fantasy but maybe it can do better with momentary peaks Alas its aggressive protection circuit would shut it down and not let me test max and peak powerNaturally the higher voltage power supply does better with 8 ohm load where we become voltage limitedSweeping power vs frequency and distortion shows a very well behaved class D amplifierConclusionsTraditionally these desktop amplifiers have produced really poor performance in the form of noise and distortion Not so anymore These TPA3255 based amps seem to have good bones in them producing above average performance for peanuts Alas you are saddled with two boxes and cheap and potentially nonsafety compliant parts For desktop use these are probably acceptable compromises I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A07 based on its performanceAnd with this our last review of 2020 comes to an end Nice that it is ending on a happy note
