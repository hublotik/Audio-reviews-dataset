0, of a DIY combination of ICEpower 200AC and 200ASC in a Ghent audio case It was kindly supplied by a local member Total part cost is US 310The case work is fineI like the hefty power switch which also acts as protection circuit indicator Speaking of that it is of nice variety that selfresets and doesnt require manual power cyclingThe back panel sports far better connectors than you could get in any mass market amplifierAnd of course balanced inputsThe internal amplification for one channel is provided by the ICEPower 200ASC which has an integrated switchmode power supply This in turn feeds power to the amplifieronly 200AC module Nice and cleverICEpower 200AC MeasurementsLets run our usual dashboard into 4 ohmHaving been spoiled by high performance class D amplifiers this is somewhat of a letdown Distortion is dominated by third harmonic at around 78 dB which sets SINAD to the same rating Result is average performance among all amplifiers measured to dateSignal to noise ratio is good thoughFrequency response is as wellPower into 4 ohm though show early rise of distortionDisappointing to see performance be worse than some of the worst AVRs we have measured at the limit Same is true at 8 ohmEven when we allow distortion to rise to 1 we still dont get the rated 200 watt powerThe power supply is the limiting factor likelySweeping the power range at different frequencies gives us very complex responseThe lines going backward are caused by the amplifier going into temporary shutdown This is occurring at just 40 or so watts at 20 kHz Fortunately there is not much music power there but still from engineering point of view I like to see far cleaner and stable response In some cases SINAD is rising to below 50 dB at just 2 wattsConclusionsAs usual we have high efficiency and compact packaging of class D amplification here What we dont have is performance that matches or beats good class D amplifiers Of course the cost is much lower as well  So you have a trade off to make I am too much of a perfectionist to want to recommend this unit but depending on what you are using it for it may be fine
