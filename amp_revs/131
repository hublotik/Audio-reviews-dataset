0,I measured Bel Canto Designs Black ACI 600   Usually before I test an amplifier I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour but this is relevant only for an amplifier with a conventional output stage As the ACI 600 uses classD output modules I began testing it soon after turning it on However as classD amplifiers produce RF noise that could drive my analyzers input circuitry into slewrate limiting I inserted between the test load and the analyzer Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz Fort some tests I also used the SYS2700s internal brickwall filter set to 20kHz to ensure that my measurements were not being contaminated with noise above the audiobandLooking first at the singleended analog line inputs the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the default maximum of 85 measured a low 191dB There might be insufficient gain with lowoutput sources but selecting a maximum volume of 100 with the onscreen menu increased the gain to 341dB The Soft mute setting reduced the level by 10dB the Mute was of course a full mute It should be noted that with highoutput sources the analog inputs clipped at 2375V These inputs inverted absolute polarity and the input impedance was a relatively low 11k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz I had some problems measuring the output at the rearpanel headphone jack as I could get output only in the left channel However the headphone output impedance was low at 21 ohms at all audio frequencies and the output preserved absolute polarity The output impedance at the speaker terminals was 02 ohm at all audio frequencies as a result the modulation of the ACI 600s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±02dB  The response is down by 15dB at 20kHz and above that frequency it drops off rapidly into all impedances There is also a slight channel imbalance of 02dB  Without the auxiliary Audio Precision lowpass filter the waveform of a 10kHz squarewave  was obscured by HF noise  With the AP filter  the waveforms risetimes were increased by the ultrasonic rolloff seen in fig1 and there is critically damped ringing on the leading edges presumably due to the classD modules output filter The Bass EQ control  shelved up or down the output below 120Hz by as much as 3dB and the Tilt control hinged the response above and below 800Hz by up to the same 3dB Fig1 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 analog input frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8

8 ohms with AP lowpass filterFig4 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 analog input response of Bass EQ Control set to 0 and ±3 Fig5 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 analog input response of Tilt Control set to 0 and ±5 Channel separation was 100dB or greater below 1kHz and still 70dB at the top of the audioband The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio—taken with the AP auxiliary filter the input shorted to ground and the volume control set to 85—was 685dB this improving to a respectable 83dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 855dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor  indicated the presence of a 60Hz component at –95dB ref 1W into 8 ohms and that all other ACsupply harmonics lay below –100dBFig6 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Figs 7 and 8 show how the Black ACI 600s percentage of THDnoise varied with output power into 8 and 4 ohms respectively Actual distortion began to emerge from the noise floor at around 20W into both loads but remained low in absolute terms until waveform clipping occurred The Bel Canto is specified as offering 300Wpc into 8 ohms or 600Wpc into 4 ohms  but these graphs shows that while the ACI 600 with both channels driven exceeded its specified 8ohm clipping power at 320W  it missed its 4ohm power spec by just 02dB delivering 515W at 1 THDNFig7 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig8 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI measured how the ACI 600s THDN varied with frequency at a level 20V where I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise  The THD was very low below 5kHz in both channels into 8 ohms  but increased into 4 ohms more in the right channel  than the left  The THD was higher into 2 ohms  The distortion itself comprised the relatively innocuous third harmonic  with some second harmonic also present  Intermodulation distortion was relatively low in level Fig9 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 analog input THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig10 Bel Canto Black ACI 600

impedances all selectable with the onscreen menu The gain measured at the speaker terminals with the volume control set to 85 ranged from 604dB  to 864dB  The RIAA error was vanishingly small  though the highs and lows rolled off respectively reaching –3dB at 35kHz and at 17Hz Noise levels were low and with the lowest gain setting the unweighted wideband SN ratio was an okay 58dB this improving to 71dB when Aweighted The SN ratio decreased as the gain was increased Phono overload margins were good at 15dB at 20Hz 12dB at 1kHz and 11dB at 20kHz Harmonic and intermodulation distortion levels via the phono input were also respectably low Fig13 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 phono input RIAA error at 1mV input Turning to the Black ACI 600s behavior with digital data I tested it using the Audio Precisions TosLink and coaxial SPDIF and AESEBU inputs and repeated the tests with WAV and AIFF files sourced from Pure Music 30 running on my MacBook Pro via the ACI 600s USBB input Both SPDIF inputs locked to datastreams with sample rates of up to 96kHz the AESEBU input up to 192kHz The USBB input accepted 16 and 24bit integer data sampled up to 384kHz However while the frontpanel display did show 384 with data sampled at that rate the ACI 600s output remained muted Apples USB Prober utility identified the ACI 600 as BELCANTO HiRes 2 from XMOS and that it operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous modeWith the ACI 600s volume control set to 85 a 1kHz tone at 0dBFS gave rise to an output of 2126V from the speaker outputs the latter equivalent to 565W into 8 ohms Fullscale digital data didnt allow the amplifier to reach its full output therefore if the ACI 600 wont drive its owners speakers to high enough levels with its default maximum volumecontrol setting of 85 the optional setting of 100 will add another 15dBThe Bel Cantos impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a minimumphase type with all the ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS but also that the digital inputs are inverted With 441kHzsampled white noise  the ACI 600s response rolled off slowly above the Nyquist frequency or half the sample rate  An alias at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  is therefore attenuated by just 20dB The ACI 600s reconstruction filter appears to be identical to the standard MQA filter in both the time and frequency domains and Bel Cantos John Stronczer confirmed via email that they use this filter not only with MQA but with all PCM data because he feels it sounds best for all sourcesFig14 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 digital input impulse response Fig15 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig16 shows the ACI 600s digital frequency response with AESEBU data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  and 192kHz  The response follows the same basic shape at all three sample rates with a sharp rolloff just below each of the two lower Nyquist frequencies With highsamplerate data the digital response was dominated by the amplifiers ultrasonic rolloff When the ACI 600 decoded dithered 16 and 24bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with the volume control set to 85 to minimize the effect of its selfnoise the increase in bit depth dropped the noise floor by around 15dB  which implies resolution of close to between 18 and 19 bits With an undithered 16bit tone at exactly–9031dBFS  the waveform was symmetrical but the three DC voltage levels described by the data are overlaid by some highfrequency noise With undithered 24bit data  the result was a fairly clean sinewaveFig16 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 digital input frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Fig17

its digital inputs with a signal comprising equal levels of 19 and 20kHz tones peaking at –3dBFS  rather than my usual 0dBFS This is because the MQA filter overloads with topoctave data above that level in his email Stronczer explained that this was acceptable because real music as opposed to test tones never has highlevel energy that high in frequency The leaky nature of the filter allows aliased images of the tones to appear but actual intermodulation distortion is very low in level With 16bit JTest data  all of the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave are reproduced at the correct levels  However a lowlevel pair of sidebands can be seen at ±120HzFig20 Bel Canto Black ACI 600 digital input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at –3dBFS 441kHz

output and the inability to play data sampled at 384kHz via the USBB input both of which may be sample faults it offers respectable measured performance
