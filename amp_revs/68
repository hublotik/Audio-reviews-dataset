0,Since he wrote about them in his March 2009 Music in the Round column Kalman Rubinson has been using as his reference power amplifiers Bel Cantos eOne Ref1000 Mk2 classD monoblocks  Like the original Ref1000 which KR wrote about in November 2006 the Mk2  uses Bang  Olufsens 1000ASP ICEpower modules but with improvements in mechanical damping parts selection and filtering of the residual switching noise present at the amplifiers output With the Bel Cantos driving his BW 802D speakers Kal found the amplifiers sounded even livelier and more transparent than their predecessors with no vestige of HF grain to mar the awesome illusionCompared with nonswitching amps such as Classés Omicron or CA3200 the Bel Canto eOnes could seem somewhat literal in terms of their tightly defined twochannel soundstage he wrote but that disappeared in multichannel use In fact even in stereo I could make a case for the Bel Cantos being more truthful than the Classés if less luxuriousAs part of Stereophiles continuing program of publishing measurements FollowUps of sonically promising products that have been reviewed by the magazines regular columnists I subjected the Ref1000M to my usual battery of tests I mainly used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain To minimize the effect of the HF switching noise on the measurements I used an Audio Precision passive lowpass filter ahead of each analyzer As usual  amplifier  by running it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour before performing any measurements Like any other amplifier that uses a switching output stage which is very efficient at converting electrical power from the wall into loudspeakerdriving current the Bel Canto did not get hot under these conditionsThe input impedance was to specification at low and middle frequencies at 200k ohms balanced and 100k ohms unbalanced These figures dropped to 160k and 58k ohms at 20kHz respectively but these are still usefully high input impedances Both inputs preserved absolute polarity ie were noninverting The amplifiers output impedance was 01 ohm in the audioband rising to 035 ohm at 20kHz due to the effect of its series lowpass filter ahead of the output terminals The effect of this filter can be seen in fig1 which shows the amplifiers smallsignal frequency response the output into 8 ohms rolls off rapidly above 20kHz  and with our standard simulated loudspeaker  and above 10kHz into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  There is some peaking evident into 2 ohms  but even with 8 ohms squarewaves show a welldamped overshoot  Fig1 Bel Canto eOne Ref1000M frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Bel Canto eOne Ref1000M smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Bel Canto eOne Ref1000M smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsBel Canto rates the Ref1000s maximum power at 500W into 8 ohms and 1000W into 4 ohms I measured maximum powers of 600W into 8 ohms and 1200W into 4 ohms  With continuous drive the amplifier turned itself off at 1kW into 2 ohms  which was well below clipping  Despite its minuscule size and weight this is a very powerful amplifier Distortion was very low in the midband and bass particularly into high impedances but rose in the treble  Though the rise in THDnoise was not to an alarmingly high level into 8 ohms this graph confirms that the Ref1000 will be more comfortable with higherimpedance speakers where the residual distortion at relatively low powers was primarily lowerorder harmonics  Higherorder harmonics appeared into low impedances and at higher powers  due to discontinuities at the signals zerocrossing points These harmonics all lie at relatively low levels howeverFig4 Bel Canto eOne Ref1000M THDN vs output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohmsFig5 Bel Canto eOne Ref1000M THDN vs frequency at 137V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig6 Bel Canto eOne Ref1000M 1kHz waveform at 6W into 8 ohms  0008 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig7 Bel Canto eOne Ref1000M spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–10kHz at 215W into 4 ohms Testing for intermodulation products with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones proved problematic because there appeared to be a history effect at levels much above 20V At first the REF100 Mk2 reproduced the signal without any problem but after a short while the waveform squared and remained clipped until the drive signal was reduced Fig8 shows the spectrum of the Bel Cantos output at the highest continuous level it would deliver into 4 ohms with this demanding signal While the difference product at 1kHz is very low the higherorder components at 18 and 21kHz lie just below –60dB Fig8 Bel Canto eOne Ref1000M HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 4 ohms This latest version of Bel Cantos eOne Ref1000M monoblock offers very high power from its diminutive chassis It does work best with higherimpedance loudspeakers however and at lower frequencies Fortunately music rarely includes enough high topoctave energy to reveal the amplifiers unhappiness in this region
