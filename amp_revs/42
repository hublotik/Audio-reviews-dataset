0, Mark Levinson No532H I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before testing the No532H I ran it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour which maximally stresses a classAB amplifiers ability to shed waste heat At the end of this preconditioning period the No532Hs top panel was warm at 108°F  though the exposed tops of the internal heatsinks measured 168°F  This amplifier needs plenty of ventilation The THDnoise present in the cold amplifiers output was 00019 with the amplifier hot this rose to a still very low 0006The voltage gain into 8 ohms was to specifications at 268dB using the balanced inputs and slightly higher 272dB using the unbalanced inputs Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  The XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was slightly higher than specified at 325k ohms unbalanced and 63k ohms balanced However these figures dropped to 13k and 31k ohms at 20kHz respectivelyThe output impedance including the series resistance of 6 of speaker cable was very low at 008 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 016 ohm at 20kHz The variation in the amplifiers frequency response due to the interaction between this impedance and how that of the speaker varies with frequency is therefore also very low at ±01dB  The No532Hs output drops by 05dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  but the response into higher impedances is –3dB at 100kHz which correlates with the short risetimes with a 10kHz squarewave  The 10kHz squarewave response is free from overshoot and ringing and the lowfrequency squarewave is essentially perfect Fig1 Mark Levinson No532H frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Mark Levinson No532H smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Mark Levinson No532H smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was 100dB in both directions below 1kHz and at 20kHz was still 81dB  and 85dB  The No532H is also superbly quiet its wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio ref 283V output with the input shortcircuited measured 93dB in both channels  With its high output power the No532H is one of the few amplifiers that can match the dynamic range of true highresolution recordingsFig4 shows how the THDN percentage in the No532Hs output varies with output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms The THD starts to rise above 28V RMS into each load but actual clipping occurs significantly higher in level Defining clipping as 1 THDN the No532H clips at 355Wpc into 8 ohms  at 500Wpc into 4 ohms  and with one channel driven at 660W into 2 ohms  The amplifier turned itself off at 671W into 2 ohms but turned itself back on again when the drive signal was reduced Though the distortion at lower frequencies is extremely low even at moderate power levels  it does start to rise in the treble This is due to the circuits restricted openloop bandwidth reducing the amount of corrective negative feedback applied as the frequency rises However the distortion at 20kHz is still very low even into 2 ohms Fig4 Mark Levinson No532H distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsFig5 Mark Levinson No532H THDN  vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Though low in level the distortion comprises both low and high orders  At high currents the third harmonic begins to predominate  Though the higherorder spuriae are still present their levels are very low even close to visual waveform clipping on an oscilloscope  Intermodulation distortion is also extremely low even at very high power Fig6 Mark Levinson No532H 1kHz waveform at 30W into 4 ohms  00028 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig7 Mark Levinson No532H 1kHz waveform at 45W into 2 ohms  00053 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Mark Levinson No532H spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–10kHz at 275W into 4 ohms Fig9 Mark Levinson No532H HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 260W peak into 4 ohms With its high power output and very low levels of noise and distortion the Mark Levinson No532H offers textbook measured performance
