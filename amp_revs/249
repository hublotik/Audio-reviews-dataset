0, Allo Volt D class D amplifier It was kindly sent to me by  costs US 129 in this dual mono configuration with stepped attenuatorI am not a big fan of these clear cases but in this case pun intended it worksHard to take a picture of it though without heavily accentuating dust and such that normally is not visibleDual TI TPA2116 class D amplifiers are used plus a frontend switching power supplies to generate the required plus and minus suppliesNot that no power supply comes with this amplifier You have a choice of what you put in there I used my lab power supply at its max setting of 31 volts and 3 amps It could use more than 3 amps with 4 ohm load as the power supply current limited near max power sweeps It was fine with 8 ohm load though as that doesnt need as much currentThere is no remote control so this is really a desktop amplifier There is a gain switch below that switches between 19 and 26 dB I used the default 19 dB which works well with desktop DACs that have no trouble producing near 2 volts you need for max powerOverall the Volt D makes a very positive impression with respect to looks and build qualityAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboardThis is nice Budget class D amps routinely produce SINAD in 55 to 65 dB and here we are well above that at 84 dBI was also impressed with how low the noise floor was at 5 watt playbackMany amplifiers fail to achieve 96 dB which is my target for this level of playbackCrosstalk is superb better than just about any amp I have tested recentlyFrequency response has a tiny bit of roll off at 20 kHzAs I noted in the introduction with 4 ohm load my power supply lacks enough current so I also tested with one channel drivenSo it seems that getting the 60 watt advertised power level is possibleTaking advantage of onboard capacitors I ran my burst testSo even in stereo you have over 60 watts going to nearly 90 watts with one channelPower into 8 ohm load is naturally lowerNotice that noise floor is very low contributing to very good response at lower power levelsVarying the frequency gives us the following power levels and distortionAt or below 1 kHz response is excellent and frequency independent Above that it varies which is typical of many class D ampsFinally I ran a spectrum analysis without my usual class D amp filter in the pathWow TI put some clever filteringdesign in there Usually the switching frequency is down just 10 to 2 dB from our main tone Here nothing rises above 88 dB or so TI advertises that the amp will not interfere with AM radio and it definitely wontConclusionsThe Allo Volt D amplifier is a delightful surprise Careful design has elevated the performance of these switching chip amplifiers to that of mass market hificlass AB designs Yet it runs cool and costs very little Yes you need an external power supply and that is the only flaw I see with going with this solution Overall I am happy to recommend the Allo Volt D for its nice and elegant design and performance especially at this price
