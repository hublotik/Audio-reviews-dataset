Carver Crimson 275 tube stereo power amplifier It purchased new member paulbottlehead given testing It costs US 2750I really like way amplifier looks The burgundy color attractive handle On latter unit light though handle handy necessary lift thing Back panel shows high quality connectorsThe tubes four Tunsol KT120 pair 12AT7W 12AX7 original boxes owner installation Went open one small tube boxes found nothing Worried I looked around come box floating larger box came inPrior installation tubes I something investigate clearly something loose rattling around So I took back panel find metal screw rolling around thereNot sure supposed go There hole something second fuse bottom I think would nutI like lack safety ground IEC terminalInstead kind local star grounding referenced neutral using resistor That naturally wont work safety purposes With power supply board mounted vertically voltages high 300 volts I sure heck would want metal case grounded I dont care audioelectrical problem trying solve I want safe product first foremost Naturally safetyregulatory certification I expect company name Carver able affordI got kick beefy speaker terminals ultrathin wires leading Yes lengths short wattage probably fine optics point view would want use something better hair thin wiring I sad see VU meter glued caseI realize welding couple threaded standoffs case costs money price I expect The meter backlit another disappointment But useful checking bias right spec 100 milliampsSo nice looks skin number concernsCarver Crimson 275 MeasurementsI usually let amplifiers warm watch behavior also let things stabilize measurements Manual states bias checked 20 minutes I let run long bit moreNote vertical scale 3 dB dont alarmed variations Generally speaking unit table couple minutes warm But fascinating see performance gradually get worse kept warming So next comes usual dashboard My Audio Precision analyzer default floating RCA terminals But I override grounding I observed oscillations No attempt grounding made difference power supplymains humThe power supply noise really dirties FFT spectrum looking past see low SINAD dominated distortion Unlike common reputation tubes distortion third harmonic part second Naturally high level distortion places 275 low scale second one amp ever testedCompany spec quite good noise level relative full power I could get without aweightingBut applying aweighting filter getting rid power supply noise essentially get thereCrosstalk poorFrequency response odd shape good bit loss high frequencies 4 ohm loadOutput impedance high enough combining load change high frequency roll Things get better 8 ohm loadThere RC filter speaker terminals Wonder providing roll offUsing 32 tones simulate music see high level grass would obscure low level detailNotice worse performance low frequenciesThere controversy regarding ability 275 produce rated power 75 watts lets start 4 ohm load I usually doThe amplifier produced 29 watts blew 3 amp mains fuse Fortunately two spares provided allowing continue testing Company specs distortion less 1 lets see power ratingVery dramatic difference 1 2 second power vs short bursts There clearly capacity problem produce sustained power Note 1 kHz industry convention Note allowing 1 THD reduces power even I allowed power sweepI surprised see selectable output impedance 8 ohm load proceed test isWe blew second fuse power much healthy 60 wattsHoping blow last fuse I kept max power level lower I changed frequenciesPerformance reasonable got 20 Hz became super erratic blew third fuse It produced 14 wats well short 30 watts produced higher frequencies I would wanted test frequencies past midnight I feel like hunting around find replacement fusesConclusionsAs Carver owner 40 years I soft spot designer Alas I like things amp like nice looking paint I disappointed QC construction unit respect safety Loose screws glued meters part nears 3000 amplifier Measured performance awful course one would expect many audiophile tube amps But third harmonic dominant blows away story audibly good thing Clearly specifications amplifier incorrect 4 ohm load And low frequency behavior poorUnless going buy Carver Crimson 275 look I cant recommend many reasons stated I expect man legendPS It nice take break drying flooded home get back normalcy testing amp It cheered working I enjoyEDIT We two formal responses Bob CarverCarver Crimson 275 Review What baffles make amp safe hum free doesnâ€™t take much effort They taking lazy design approach Not counting total disrespect customers disregarding safetywwwaudiosciencereviewcomCarver Crimson 275 Review This addressed first thread Yes Amir I done measurements negative speaker terminal floating Thank youwwwaudiosciencereviewcomAnd one Wyred4Sound manufactures unitCarver Crimson 275 Review I think pretty clear Mr Carver keeping controlled distance BCC push came shove would say hey yes design I idea done since I sold company would need check If one called Bob Carver really iswwwaudiosciencereviewcomAnd bunch one dealers Jim ClarkCarver Crimson 275 Review Listen Why Audio Science Review sine waves

contributor Have fun keep session going enjoywwwaudiosciencereviewcomCarver Crimson 275 Review After first fuse blew I would searched around slowblow maybe even 4A testing The manual repeatedly says use slow blow fuse replacement This new unit returned doesnt perform I followed manual letterwwwaudiosciencereviewcomCarver Crimson 275 Review I would love see happen point faith But I commend fighting good fight There wise saying people overestimate nature change beginning underestimate long run We left former stage nowwwwaudiosciencereviewcomCarver Crimson 275 Review I would love see
