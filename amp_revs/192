0,When I unpacked the Riviera Levante amplifier and lifted it onto the test bench it struck me that this is actually eight amplifiers in one It has balanced and singleended linelevel inputs Its output stage can be operated in classA or classAB It was supplied with two choices for the two input stage ECC8112AT7 tubes vintage Mullards or modern JJs Add to those variations that the Levante has a headphone output and an optional phono stage  and it became clear that I had a lot of testing ahead of meI decided to focus on the Riviera amplifiers behavior with the Mullard tubes and the unbalanced inputs performing every test in both of the outputstage modes I then repeated some of the tests with the balanced inputs and finally looked at how the amplifiers behavior with the JJ tubes differed from how it had performed with the Mullard tubes All the testing was performed I first preconditioned the Riviera Levante by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified classAB power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the heatsink temperature was 1083°F  and that of the top and front panels was 925°F  Switching to classA operation the heatsink temperature had increased slightly after another 30 minutes to 1131°F  While I was preconditioning the amplifier  output device rail voltages They were ±29V in classA ±50V in classABThe amplifier inverted absolute polarity with all its inputs at both the loudspeaker and headphone outputs The maximum gain into 8 ohms was lower than average for an integrated amplifier at 366dB in classA and 3635dB in classAB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs The maximum gain at the headphone output was 216dB for both types of input Changing to the JJ tubes reduced these gains by 1dBThe unbalanced input impedance was 44k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz with the Mullard tubes dropping to 36k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was 42k ohms across the audioband With the JJ tubes the unbalanced input impedance was 34k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 30k ohms at 20kHzThe headphone output impedance was moderately low at 18 ohms across the audioband Set to classA operation the Levantes output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 05 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz In classAB the output impedance was slightly higher at 065 ohm at all audio frequencies  In classA mode the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between the source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was ±04dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was down by 3dB at 180kHz which correlates with the Rivieras accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  Figs1 and 2 were taken with the unbalanced inputs the Mullard tubes classA mode and the volume control set to its maximum The frequency and squarewave responses were identical with the JJ tubes in classAB and with the balanced inputs With the volume control set to –20dB the highfrequency –3dB point dropped to 110kHz but the audioband response remained flat Measured at the headphone output the response was down by just 1dB at 200kHzFig1 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classA volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms   Fig2 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classA smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was okay at 70dB in both directions below 3kHz dropping to 53dB at the top of the audioband The Rivieras unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum was 706dB ref 283V into 8 ohms  in both classA and classAB modes This ratio improved to 72dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 80dB when Aweighted The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its even and oddorder harmonics  the latter higher in level than the former particularly in the left channel  Fig3 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classA spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms volume control set to maximum With both channels driven the Levantes maximum power in classA is specified as 30Wpc into 8 ohms and 60Wpc into 4 ohms  We define clipping as when the THDnoise in an amplifiers output reaches 1 By that standard the Levante didnt meet its specified powers the 1 THDN power measuring 16Wpc into 8 ohms  and 213Wpc into 4 ohms  However relaxing the criterion to 3 THDN the Riviera amplifier clipped at 49Wpc into 8 ohms  and 79Wpc into 4 ohms  The picture was similar in classAB The Levante delivered 12Wpc into 8 ohms  at 1 THDN 125Wpc at 3  and 18Wpc into 4 ohms  at 1 and 195Wpc into 4 ohms at 3  The AC mains voltage was 1191V with the amplifier clipping in classA into 4 ohmsFig4 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classA distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classA distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classAB distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classAB distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe upward slope of the traces below the actual clipping power in figs4–7 indicates that the distortion increases in almost a linear manner with increasing power before the onset of actual waveform clipping This will be due to what is called a bent transfer function  I suspect that this bent function will be due to the input tube rather than the amplifiers output stage I examined how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 489V which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms 6W into 4 ohms and 12W into 2 ohms With the Mullard tubes the distortion into 8 ohms  was 047 at low and middle frequencies rising slightly in the treble It also rose into 4 ohms  and into 2 ohms  The distortion was slightly lower with the JJ tubes  but the behavior was otherwise identicalFig8 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classA THDN  vs frequency at 489V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig9 Riviera Levante JJ tubes classA THDN  vs frequency at 489V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms These levels of distortion would be very audible if they comprised the fifth and higher harmonics  However fig10 indicates that the relatively subjectively benign second harmonic was dominant in both classA and classAB output modes This waveform graph was taken with the Mullard tubes Though HR found the JJ tubes to sound different from the Mullards the JJs produced an almost identical THDN waveform  This was confirmed by the spectra of the amplifiers output at moderate power into 8 ohms with the Mullard tubes  and JJ tubes  The second harmonic is by far the highest in level at –40dB  with the Mullards and –43dB  with the JJs The second was also by far the highestlevel harmonic present in the headphone output at –47dB  at 1V into 300 ohms Finally when the Levante drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10W peak into 8 ohms in either classA or classAB with both Mullard and JJ tubes the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at –44dB  with the higherorder intermodulation products at 18kHz and 21kHz 10dB lower in level At the same voltage into 4 ohms the intermodulation products rose by 3dBFig10 Riviera Levante Mullard tubes classA 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms 095 THDN  distortion and noise

stage capable of being switched between classA and classAB operation Rivieras Levante reminded me of the Marantz MA5 amplifier that I reviewed for HiFi News magazine in August 1983 which like the Levante could output 30W in classA and 120W in classAB But unlike that Marantz which featured conventional levels of negative feedback the Levantes measured behavior is dominated by the designers decision not to use feedback especially around the input tubes His reasons for doing so are discussed in the review but my experience has been that the resultant harmonic signature will lend this amplifier a distinctive sonic character Footnote 1 I created tracks on Stereophiles Test CD 2 to allow listeners to hear at what percentage of second third and seventh harmonic they become aware of the distortion
