0,Because of the VAC Statement 452 iQs bulk and weight I drove my  system and its host PC  test loads digital and analog oscilloscopes cables and other gear to Michael Fremers place for the measurements The only space available for me to set everything up was in the garage along the corridor from Michaels basement listening room I ran two extension cables from a 20A outlet in the corridor one for the test system and the other for one of the amplifiers  I later repeated some of the testing on the other amplifier SN 1929702 The graphs in this report show the results with SN 1929702 which has slightly lower distortion in the treble The two samples otherwise behaved identicallyThe Statement 452 iQ can be used as a twochannel amplifier but as Michael had exclusively performed his listening with a pair of the amplifiers connected as monoblocks that is how I tested it I made sure I connected the test loads to the third rightmost pair of binding posts which were labeled Mono and that both switches on the rear panel were set to Mono As the VAC amplifiers output in this mode floats with respect to ground I left the analyzers input floating I connected the Audio Precisions signal generator outputs balanced or singleended to the right channels input jacks which is how Michael had been using the amplifiers I let the amplifier warm up before performing any testing and the LEDs on the front panel indicated that all was well with the eight KT88 output tubesThe VACs voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 27dB from both inputs and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  The balanced input impedance was a usefully high 96k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 92k ohms at the top of the audioband The unbalanced input impedance was a high 83k ohms at 1kHz but unusually dropped to 32k ohms at 20Hz and 885k ohms at 20kHzThe Statement 452 iQs output impedance was 094 ohm at all audio frequencies which is low for a tube amplifier As a result the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was relatively small at ±07dB  The response into resistive loads  was flat in the audioband with then a steep rolloff above 100kHz A very small peak just before the ultrasonic rolloff is associated with the VACs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  which features a small amount of overshoot and three damped cycles of ultrasonic ringing A 1kHz squarewave was reproduced with superbly flat tops and bottoms  confirming the extended lowfrequency response a tribute to the amplifiers output transformersFig1 VAC Statement 452 IQ frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 VAC Statement 452 IQ smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsWhen I repeated the frequency response measurement with the singleended input  the ultrasonic rolloff started a little earlier at 60kHz rather than 100kHz and the lowfrequency output gently sloped down below 400Hz reaching –1dB at 30Hz This behavior might have been associated with the reduced input impedance at low frequencies It wouldnt have affected Michaels auditioning as he exclusively used the balanced input However it does suggest that the VAC amplifiers balanced input is to be preferred to the singleended inputMeasured with the balanced input shorted to ground the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was 687dB ref 1W into 8 ohms increasing slightly to 692dB when I restricted the measurement bandwidth to the audioband When the reading was Aweighted the SN ratio improved further to a good 8375dB With no signal  spuriae were present at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its harmonics The oddorder harmonics which will be due to magnetic interference from the power transformer were lower in level than the evenorder harmonics which are due to a nonzero impedance to ground somewhere in the circuit Peculiarly when I drove the amplifier with a balanced 1kHz tone with the output equal to 1W into 8 ohms not only did the lowfrequency noise floor rise by about 10dB  but sidebands spaced at 120Hz now accompanied the 1kHz tone I have no idea where these sidebands come from but they remained unchanged when I experimented with different cables and grounding arrangements between both samples of the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzerFig3 VAC Statement 452 IQ spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms  and with no signal VAC specifies the Statement 452 iQs maximum power when used as a monoblock as 450W into 4 ohms  With our usual definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the VAC clipped at 235W into 8 ohms  However less power was available into 4 ohms at 1 THDN 183W  though 370W was available at 3 THDN  and 410W at 10 THDN  I doubt that this shortfall in maximum power into 4 ohms would have affected the auditioning Given the high sensitivity of the Wilson speakers Michael was never asking the amplifiers to deliver more than 40W or soFig4 VAC Statement 452 IQ distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 VAC Statement 452 IQ distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency at 1265V which is when the distortion in figs4 and 5 begins to rise above the noise floor This voltage is equivalent to 10W into 16 ohms 20W into 8 ohms 40W into 4 ohms and 80W into 2 ohms The THDN was commendably low in the treble into 16 and 8 ohms  but rose at lower frequencies and into lower impedances The distortion at 40W into 4 ohms  was still acceptably low but at 80W into 2 ohms it rose above 1 at the frequency extremes This suggests that the single secondary winding of the Statement 452 iQs output transformer is optimized for loads of 8 ohms rather than the 4 ohms specified by the manufacturerFig6 VAC Statement 452 IQ THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms Fortunately the VAC amplifiers distortion in the midrange and above was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  The level of the third harmonic was below that of the second at low frequencies into 8 ohms  but peculiarly spurious tones were present at frequencies mathematically related to the 50Hz signal and 60Hz and its evenorder harmonics This odd behavior was also present at the same voltage in 4 ohms though the third harmonic of the 50Hz tone was now equal in level to the second  Intermodulation distortion when the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 20W into 8 ohms  was commendably low the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lying at –82dB  Higherorder products were also low in levelFig7 VAC Statement 452 IQ 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms 0047 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 VAC Statement 452 IQ spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20W into 8 ohms Fig9 Valve Amplification Company Statement 452 IQ HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms In some ways the Valve Amplification Company Statement 452 iQ did well on the test bench The wide smallsignal bandwidth the excellent squarewave reproduction the low intermodulation distortion and the very low distortion in the treble at lowtomoderate powers into high impedances are commendable But the shortfall in maximum power into 4 ohms and the supplyrelated spuriae present in the noise floor did concern me Footnote 1 With the amplifier idling the AC line voltage was 119V This dropped to 1175V with the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms The shortfall in power wasnt due therefore to an unusually low line voltage
