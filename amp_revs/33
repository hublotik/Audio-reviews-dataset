0, on one of the PS Audio Stellar M1200s    Because the Stellar M1200 features a classD output stage all the measurements other than the frequency response tests and one of the squarewave tests were taken with Audio Precisions AUX0025 auxiliary passive lowpass filter which eliminates much of the ultrasonic noise that might otherwise drive the analyzers input into slewrate limiting Without the filter 373mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the amplifier output terminalsThe Stellar M1200s voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was a little higher than usual at 305dB with both balanced and unbalanced input signals  Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  and the singleended input impedance was 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies decreasing slightly and inconsequentially to 376k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was exactly twice these values as expected The output impedance  was very low at 005 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz and 008 ohm at 20kHzThe gray trace in fig1 shows the Stellar M1200s smallsignal frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker The variations in response were a negligible ±005dB Into resistive loads  the amplifier rolled off above the audioband with –3dB frequencies between 40kHz and 50kHz depend ing on the load resistance The Stellar M1200s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured a slight amount of welldamped overshoot This graph was taken with the auxiliary lowpass filter it is absent when I repeated the test without the filter  though the trace is now overlaid with ultrasonic noiseFig1 PS Audio Stellar M1200 balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 PS Audio Stellar M1200 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision lowpass filterFig3 PS Audio Stellar M1200 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms without Audio Precision lowpass filterThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  was okay measuring 663dB This ratio improved to 786dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband and 827dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor while the Stellar M1200 drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms  revealed that no ACrelated spuriae were present and that the SN ratios were dominated by random noise componentsFig4 PS Audio Stellar M1200 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The PS Audio met its specified output powers of 600W into 8 ohms and 1200W into 4 ohms  clipping at 610W into 8 ohms  and 1200W into 4 ohms  Fig7 plots the percentage of THDnoise into 8 4 and 2 ohms at a level 20V  at which I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise The THD was very low at low and middle frequencies into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  but rose into 2 ohms  and in the top two audio octavesFig5 PS Audio Stellar M1200 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 PS Audio Stellar M1200 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 PS Audio Stellar M1200 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The distortion signature into 8 ohms was predominantly the relatively benign third harmonic  which was low in level lying at –83dB  To my surprise when I repeated the spectral analysis at the same voltage into 4 ohms  the third harmonic disappeared and was replaced by the second harmonic at –87dB  Higher harmonics now made an appearance though these all lie at or below –100dB  Despite the decreasing linearity at high frequencies seen in fig7 the M1200 performed well when driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms  The 1kHz difference product lay at –94dB from the peak signal level  and the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were a little lower in levelFig8 PS Audio Stellar M1200 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00063 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 PS Audio Stellar M1200 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig10 PS Audio Stellar M1200 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Fig11 PS Audio Stellar M1200 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms The PS Audio Stellar M1200s performance in the test lab indicates that it is a welldesigned wellengineered powerhouse
