0,I measured Myteks Brooklyn Amp   Before I test a classAB amplifier I usually precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour As the Brooklyn Amp has classD output modules such preconditioning is irrelevant However the Mytek did get warm in use after an hour or so the temperature of the top panel was 1074°F  As classD amplifiers produce RF noise that could drive my analyzers input circuitry into slewrate limiting between the test load and the analyzer I inserted Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHzThe Brooklyn Amp is specified as having a voltage gain of 23 or 29dB selectable with one of the rearpanel DIP switches However the relevant switch had no effect Frustrated I downloaded Myteks Control app from their website and ran it on my laptop which was connected to the Brooklyns USB port  The app offered a choice of 0dB or 6dB—at those settings the balanced gain into 8 ohms measured very close to the respective specifications of 229 and 289dB The respective unbalanced gains were 182 and 212dB—note the difference between them of 3dB rather than the expected 6dBBoth sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  and the input impedance specified as 10k ohms was 198k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz for the balanced inputs and 17k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz for the unbalanced inputs the latter dropping slightly at 20kHz to 15k ohms The output impedance including a 6 spacedpair speaker cable was very low at 006 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz but rose to 03 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modulation of the Brooklyn Amps frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was very small in the midrange but reached 025dB at the top of the audioband before rapidly rolling off above 25kHz  The topoctave boost was less well developed into 8 ohms  and the response rolled off earlier into lower impedances It was down by 1dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  The slight boost at 20kHz into higher impedances is presumably due to the lowpass filter on the classD stages output the boost is associated with a slight degree of leadingedge overshoot with a 10kHz squarewave  but the overshoot is critically damped with no ringing evidentFig1 Mytek Brooklyn Amp frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Mytek Brooklyn Amp smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 70dB at the top of the audioband Without the AP lowpass filter there was 315mV of ultrasonic noise present on the Myteks output With the AP filter the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the inputs shorted to ground was a high 761dB  ref 1W into 8 ohms The SN ratio improved to a very good 849dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 879dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit Other than the inevitable ultrasonic noise produced by a classD design this is a quiet amplifier Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor  revealed no ACsupply–related harmonicsFig3 Mytek Brooklyn Amp spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Defining clipping as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1 Mytek specifies the Brooklyn Amp as clipping at 250Wpc into 8 ohms  at 300Wpc into 4 ohms  and at 400Wpc into 2 ohms  I measured clipping powers of 245W into 8 ohms  and 315Wpc into 4 ohms  both with both channels driven However when I tried to measure the clipping power into 2 ohms the Mytek went into protection mode at 310W  with any further increase in the input voltage not resulting in a higher output power But considering that this power was being produced by a small box weighing less than 7 lb I dont think this is an issue that will be of any concern in practical use with speakers whose impedance doesnt drop below 3 ohmsFig4 Mytek Brooklyn Amp distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Mytek Brooklyn Amp distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI examined how the Brooklyns percentage of THDN varied with frequency at 20V  The THDN was extremely low in the bass and midrange into both impedances  with the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in openloop voltage gain as the frequency increases However I couldnt plot how the THDN changed into 2 ohms as the amplifier turned off its outputs after a few seconds of operating at this level It turned itself on again as soon as I reduced the level of the input signalFig6 Mytek Brooklyn Amp THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The THDN waveform at 160Wpc into 8 ohms  is difficult to interpret due to the presence of audioband noise However looking at the waveform on an analog scope which averages out most of the noise indicated that the distortion signature is primarily third harmonic in nature This was confirmed by spectral analysis of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  with the second and higherorder harmonics all lying below –100dB  Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with the signal peaking at 100Wpc into 4 ohms the Mytek produced low levels of intermodulation distortion  with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –110dB  and the higherorder products at or below –84dB Fig7 Mytek Brooklyn Amp 1kHz waveform at 160W into 8 ohms 01 THDN  distortion and noise
