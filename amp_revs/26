0, Bryston 7B SST2s measured behavior using mainly Stereophiles loaner sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain s on an amplifier I run it for 60 minutes at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage The Brystons chassis and heatsinks were way too hot to touch after 30 minutes of running at this power level though after the full hour I could still keep my hand on the front panel implying a temperature of about 131°F  Clearly the 7B SST2 has enough heatsink capacity for sustained highpower useThe Brystons voltage gain into 8 ohms was 29dB when the amplifier was set to 1V sensitivity 229dB when set to 2V these figures the same for both balanced and unbalanced drive Both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot The balanced input impedance was 10k ohms across the audioband the unbalanced stayed close to a moderately low 75k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping a little to 72k ohms at 20kHz This would not have been a problem for the unbalanced outputs of MFs darTZeel preamplifier which is what he used for the auditioning but the Brystons balanced input is incompatible with the darTZeels balanced output which has an atypically high source impedance that varies with frequencyThe Brystons output impedance was low for a balanced design at 011 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising slightly to 017 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between its source impedance and that of the speaker will be small With our simulated loudspeaker the variations in response remained within ±01dB limits  The amplifiers response into 8 ohms didnt reach –3dB until almost 200kHz  which correlates with the welldefined 10kHz squarewave response  The 7B SST2s output does start to fall slightly above 10kHz into lower impedances into 2 ohms  the output at 20kHz is down 04dB though this will have no subjective consequencesFig1 Bryston 7B SST2 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Bryston 7B SST2 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe 7B SST2 is a quiet amplifier Its unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured 756dB this improving to 92dB with the measurement bandwidth restricted to the audioband and to 957dB when Aweighted These figures were in the lowgain setting the highgain performance was approximately 3dB worse Fig3 plots the percentage of THDnoise in the Brystons output against power The downward slope of the plots below 10W implies that what distortion is present is buried beneath the noise Only into 2 ohms does the amplifiers THD start to rise above the noise at relatively low powers but even then it remains less than 001 below actual waveform clipping The Brystons maximum power delivery is specified at 600W into 8 ohms  the traces in fig3 indicate that at clipping  the amplifier puts out 632W into 8 ohms  930W into 4 ohms  but 690W into 2 ohms Fig3 Bryston 7B SST2 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsI examined how the Brystons THDN percentage changed with frequency at a level of 14V or 245W into 8 ohms where the distortion was starting to emerge from the background noise  The THD starts to rise above 1kHz more so into 4 ohms  than into 8 ohms  due to the falling amount of openloop gain margin reducing the effectiveness of the negativefeedback mojo The amplifier is clearly less comfortable into 2 ohms  even so the absolute distortion levels remain very low at all frequenciesFig4 Bryston 7B SST2 THDN  vs frequency at 14V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms More important fig5 reveals that the distortion spectrum consists almost entirely of subjectively innocuous loworder components though a comparison of the spectra at high power into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  indicates that the third harmonic rises as the output current increases Note however the very low level of AC supply spuriae in these graphs The 7B SST2s power supply is clearly more than adequate for the high powers this amplifier is designed to deliver Finally when tested at close to clipping into 4 ohms with the demanding combination of 19 and 20kHz tones the Brystons output spectrum  was more like that of a preamplifier with all intermodulation products at or below –100dB Fig5 Bryston 7B SST2 1kHz waveform at 196W into 4 ohms  00019 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 Bryston 7B SST2 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 196W into 8 ohms Fig7 Bryston 7B SST2 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 382W into 4 ohms Fig8 Bryston 7B SST2 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 400W peak into 4 ohms As is usual with Bryston amplifiers the 7B SST2 offers textbook measured performance and usefully high power
