0,I started testing the sample of the Technics SUR1000 that KM had auditioned serial number GJ1001007   However while I was performing the smallsignal tests the amplifier turned itself off The temperature of the black grilles on the amplifiers top panel which cover the internal heatsinks was 1279°F529°C I wondered if the amplifier had overheated According to the manual one of the units safety devices may have been activated Press the unit onoff button to the Off position If the unit does not switch to standby disconnect the AC power supply cord wait for at least 3 minutes then reconnect itI followed these instructions waiting 20 minutes instead of 3 minutes to allow the amplifier to cool down However when I turned the amplifier on it turned itself off and would not turn itself on again Bill Voss Technics USs business development manager had a new sample serial number GJ1DA001010 shipped to me so that I could continue with the measurementsAs the SUR1000 has an output stage operating in a mode that resembles classD  I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter between the test load and the Audio Precision analyzer This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive its input circuitry into slewrate limiting I used it for all the loudspeaker output tests other than frequency response After two hours of operation the temperature of the black grilles was lower than that of the first sample at 1142°F I looked first at the Technicss performance via its balanced and singleended line inputs The SUR1000 preserved absolute polarity at all outputs The volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps and the maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 465dB for both types of inputs  At the preamplifier output the gain was 167dB and at the headphone output it was 331dB The Technicss power amplifier can be accessed separately It offered a fixed gain of 301dB The input impedance at the unbalanced line inputs was 50k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz with an inconsequential drop to 37k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was 92k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to 64k ohms at the top of the audioband The input impedance at the singleended power amplifier input jacks was 50k ohms at 20Hz 65k ohms at 1kHz and 42k ohms at 20kHzThe amplifiers output impedance at the headphone output was a relatively high 100 ohms At the preamplifier output it ranged from 728 ohms at 20Hz to 706 ohms at 20kHz The output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 009 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 07 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore a low ±025dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  peaked by almost 2dB at 70kHz but rolled off rapidly above that frequency  With a resistive 4 ohm load  the output started to roll off slightly in the top audio octave reaching –3dB at 61kHz Into 2 ohms  the output was down by 3dB at 18kHz This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum The excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the controlFig1 Technics SUR1000 volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  The SUR1000 has a unique LAPC function which is intended to compensate for the changes in a loudspeakers impedance with frequency I investigated this by connecting an 8 ohm resistor to the left channel and my simulated loudspeaker to the right  I selected LAPC with the remote control waited for the amplifier to finish measuring the load impedances and after it said that it was finished  SUR1000s frequency response with and without LAPC The blue and red traces in fig2 were taken without LAPC and are identical to the blue and gray traces in fig1 plotted with an expanded scale The green and gray traces respectively show the responses of the 8 ohm resistor and the simulated loudspeaker with LAPC The variations in response have been reduced in amplitude but not eliminated I suspect that the SUR1000 is applying the same LAPC compensation to both channels in realworld use of course the channels would be connected to identical loudspeakersFig2 Technics SUR1000 volume control set to –20dB frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  and 8 ohms  with LAPC bypassed and into simulated loudspeaker load  and 8 ohms  with LAPC activated The peak at 70kHz with 8 ohms in fig1 correlates with the slight overshoot with the Technicss reproduction of a 10kHz squarewaves leading edges into that load  There is also some ringing and a slight overshoot with the waveforms trailing edges both of which will be due to the antialiasing filter of the amplifiers AD converter There are three tone controls bass midrange and treble These offered a maximum boost of 78dB and a maximum cut of 63dB  The gray and green traces were taken with the midrange control operating but set to 0 You can see that this control covers the region between 300Hz and 3kHzFig3 Technics SUR1000 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 25kHz and still 67dB at the top of the audioband Without the auxiliary lowpass filter 316mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the loudspeaker outputs With the filter the Technicss unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the unbalanced line inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum was 482dB ref 283V into 8 ohms in both channels  This ratio improved to 71dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 744dB when Aweighted Spuriae at the supply frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics were absent in the amplifiers output but the spectrum of the random noise background varied with the setting of the volume control The magenta and red traces in fig5 were taken with the volume control set to the maximum Reducing the volume to –200 lowered the levels of the random noise at higher frequencies in both channels  However even at the maximum volume control setting the noise is relatively low in levelFig4 Technics SUR1000 frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with treble midrange and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum and set to 0  and with midrange set to 0 Fig5 Technics SUR1000 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms volume control set to maximum  and to –20dB With both channels driven the SUR1000 exceeded its specified maximum power into 8 ohms of 150Wpc  delivering 190Wpc at 1 THDnoise  Into 4 ohms the Technics clipped at 355Wpc  which is still higher than the specified power into that load I didnt test clipping power into 2 ohms as the amplifier isnt specified into that load The distortion is low at low powers so I examined how the THDN varied with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms The results are shown in fig8 The distortion is very similar into both impedances at 003 It does rise in the top two octaves however—more into 4 ohms  than into 8 ohms Fig6 Technics SUR1000 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 Technics SUR1000 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig8 Technics SUR1000 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion was predominantly the third harmonic  but at low and moderate powers it lay below the analog noisefloor The third harmonic can just be seen at –89dB  when the Technics drove a 50Hz tone at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  with the volume control set to –12dB I got somewhat different results in the two channels when the SUR1000 drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50W peak into 8 ohms  The secondorder difference product at 1kHz is very low in both channels at close to –110dB  but more highorder products are present in the right channel  than the left  I repeated this test with different signal and speaker cables and with the analyzer input channels swapped but got the same result each time It is fair to note that other than those at 17kHz 18kHz 21kHz and 22kHz all the intermodulation products lay at or below –84dB  in both channelsFig9 Technics SUR1000 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0052 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Technics SUR1000 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Fig11 Technics SUR1000 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms The Technics SUR1000 offered excellent measured performance from its line inputsDigital Input Measurements I looked at the Technics SUR1000s digitalinput performance using its TosLink input then repeated some of the tests with the USB input To avoid damaging the power amplifier stage with highlevel digital data I primarily examined the digital inputs behavior at the headphone output which mutes the loudspeaker output The SUR1000s optical and coaxial SPDIF inputs locked to data sampled up to 192kHz Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that the USB inputs accepted 16 24 and 32bit integer data sampled at rates up to 768kHz Apples USB Prober utility identified the Technics as Technics USB Audio from Panasonic Corporation and confirmed that the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous modeThe Technics SUR1000s digital inputs all preserved absolute polarity With the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at –30dBFS resulted in a level at the preamplifier output of 4414mV at the headphone output of 2918V and at the loudspeaker outputs of 1344V The latter voltage is 92dB below the amplifiers measured clipping voltage into 8 ohms It appears therefore that the digital inputs have around 21dB of excess gain Fortunately the SUR1000 has a 20dB input attenuator setting that can be activated for both analog and digital inputsThe impulse response with 441kHz data and MQA decoding turned off  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS Turning on MQA resulted in a short minimumphase impulse response  this is the filter applied by the MQA decoder to nonMQA data With 441kHzsampled white noise  the linearphase filters response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression at 24kHz just above half the sample rate  The aliased image at 25kHz of a 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  is completely suppressed and the highestlevel distortion harmonic of the 191kHz tone lay at –70dB  With the MQA decoder active white noise rolled off slowly above the audioband and a large number of aliased images of a 191kHz tone were visible both in and above the audioband Reducing the level of the 191kHz tone by 3dB eliminated most of these images Fig12 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs MQA decoding switched off impulse response Fig13 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs MQA decoding switched on impulse response Fig14 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs MQA decoding switched off wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig15 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs MQA decoding switched on wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at –3dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz The digitalinput frequency response with the MQA decoder active was flat in the audioband then rolled off relatively gently above half of each sample rate  The levels of the two channels were perfectly matchedFig16 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs MQA decoding switched on frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz   ultimate resolution of the SUR1000s digital inputs I disabled the 20dB attenuation set the volume control to its maximum and examined the spectrum at the headphone output with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16 and 24bit data Fig17 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs no input attenuation and volume control set to maximum spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  With 24bit data the noisefloor dropped by 30dB at low and middle frequencies which implies that the SUR1000 offers close to 215 bits of resolution However the headphone output will be well into clipping at levels typical of music recordings so I reran this test with the 20dB attenuator incircuit and the volume control set to –5dB  The increase in bit depth now lowers the noisefloor by around 9dB at low and middle frequencies  which suggests that in practical use the SUR1000s digital inputs will give between 17 and 18 bits of resolution Fig18 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs 20dB attenuation active and volume control set to –50 spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved With undithered 24bit data  the result was a relatively clean sinewave Intermodulation distortion via the Technics amplifiers digital inputs with the MQA filter active was extremely low in both channels Though the expected aliasing products were present I could eliminate those in the audioband by reducing the level of the mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones by 3dB Fig19 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data Fig20 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit data Fig21 Technics SUR1000

JTest data sampled at 441kHz All the oddorder harmonics of the 16bit JTest signals LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were close to the correct levels  though a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz can be seen surrounding the spectral spike that represents the highlevel tone at onequarter of the 441kHz sample rateFig22 Technics SUR1000 digital inputs highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal

singleended phono inputs I followed the manuals advice connecting a separate ground wire from the terminal on the amplifiers chassis to the ground of the Audio Precision analyzer I primarily examined the phono inputs behavior at the headphone output again to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stages with highlevel signals The Technicss phono inputs all preserved absolute polarityThe phono inputs can operate at full level or have their sensitivity reduced by 3dB 6dB or 9dB Without the attenuation the balanced phono input which is only compatible with moving coil cartridges has a maximum gain of 726dB at the preamplifier outputs 891dB at the headphone outputs and 1023dB at the speaker outputs The singleended phono input set to moving magnet offered maximum gains of 560dB 725dB and 857dB respectively The balanced phono input had an input impedance of 112 ohms across the audioband set to MM the singleended phono inputs impedance was 44k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz falling to 35k ohms at 20kHzI didnt test the Intelligent Phono EQ but even without it the SUR1000s RIAA correction  was extraordinarily accurate—one of the best I have ever measured—with superb channel matching The switchable subsonic filter  rolled off the response by 3dB at 20Hz The MM phono inputs unweighted wideband SN ratio measured with the input shorted to ground was a very good 672dB  referred to an input signal of 1kHz at 5mV Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased the ratio to 75dB while switching an Aweighting filter into circuit increased the ratio to 846dB The balanced MC inputs ratios were around 20dB lower due to this inputs higher gainFig23 Technics SUR1000 phono input response with RIAA correction into 100k ohms  and with subsonic filter  The overload margins of the Technics phono inputs measured with no input attenuation and with the volume control set to –30dB to avoid clipping the headphone output were at least 153dB ref 1kHz at 5mV MM and 175dB ref 1kHz at 500µV balanced MC from 20Hz to 20kHz The phono stages distortion was very low The only harmonic visible above the noisefloor was the second at just –90dB  Highorder intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak input level equivalent to 1kHz at 10mV was very low in level  though the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB Fig24 Technics SUR1000 MM phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100mV peak input As with the Technics SUR1000s linelevel analog inputs this amplifiers digital and phono inputs offered excellent measured performance Footnote 1 My continued thanks to MBLs Jürgen Reis for suggesting this test to me
