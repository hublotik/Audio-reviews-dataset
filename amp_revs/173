0,Following its 13power onehour preconditioning test the Manley 175 was no warmer than normal for a tube amplifier Its input impedance at 1kHz measured 146k ohms its output impedance was 16–17 ohms at low and middle frequencies decreasing slightly to just under 15 ohms at 20kHz into 4 ohms These are middleoftheroad values for a tube amplifier in my experience The Manleys performance—particularly its overall insystem frequency response—will be somewhat dependent on the partnering loudspeakerThe 175s voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 281dB DC offset was a low 07mV signalnoise  measured 957dB The amplifier was noninverting in its unbalanced modeFig1 shows the frequency response of the 175 The differences between its 8 ohm and 4 ohm responses within the audible range is insignificant The 175s 10kHz squarewave  indicates one cycle of damped ultrasonic ringing  also visible as a very narrow overshoot spike in the 1kHz squarewave  which is otherwise a textbook squarewaveFig1 Manley 175 frequency response  into 8 ohms and 4 ohms Fig2 Manley 175 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Manley 175 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe THDnoise vs frequency curves are shown in fig4 suitably low other than into the punishing 2 ohm load The 1kHz distortion waveform in fig5 for 2W output into 4 ohms indicates a mainly secondorder component The result for 1W into 4 ohms  was similar but for 4W into 2 ohms  the distortion becomes thirdorder with a higherorder component also presentFig4 Manley 175 THDnoise  vs frequency at  1W into 8 ohms 2W into 4 ohms 4W into 2 ohmsFig5 Manley 175 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 Manley 175 1kHz waveform at 4W into 2 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out The spectrum of the 175s output reproducing 50Hz into 4 ohms at a level of 113W is shown in fig7 the largest artifact is the third harmonic at 150Hz at –37dB or about 15 with the second and fifth harmonics not far behind Fig8 shows the output spectrum with the 175 amplifying a combined 1920kHz signal  The level was 52W into 8 ohms with clipping visible just above this power level The highest artifacts here are at 1kHz  and 21kHz  The artifacts of this input signal at 53W into 4 ohms  were 5–8dB higher about 1 at 1kHz and 12 at 21kHz Both the 50Hz and the 1920kHz spectral responses are acceptable performance for a highpower tube amplifier though not at all exceptional compared with the best weve measured from amplifiers in generalFig7 Manley 175 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 113W into 4 ohms  Note that the third harmonic at 150Hz is the highest in level at –37dB Fig8 Manley 175 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–22kHz 1920kHz at 52W into 8 ohms The 1kHz THDN vs output power curves are shown in fig9 The distortion characteristic here is quite different from that of most solidstate amplifiers The distortion increases unmistakably up to the breakpoint or knee The overall levels of distortion are moderately high—though acceptable—and the amplifier doesnt quite make its power specs The clipping levels are shown in Table 1 for three levels of THDN Fig9 Manley 175 distortion  vs output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms and 2 ohmsTable 1 Maximum Output PowerLoad 1 THDN15 THDN3 THDNohmsW W W 8126 1275 1326 448 875 160  317  268 784 All line voltages 115V except   114VOverall the measurement results for the 175 are good for a highpowered tube amplifier The 175s distortion at lower impedances restrains its power output for a given level of distortion but it will put out significant power into 4 ohms if you allow for a 3 THDN level As delivered from Dick Olsher the bias levels of the 175s output tubes had been set about 20 below the recommended values I rebiased the tubes according to the manufacturers directions the above results reflect this However before doing this I made several measurements at the lower bias setting the differences while favoring the recommended bias were not particularly significant I measured about 10W more output into 8 ohms and only marginally lower distortion with the correct bias Apparently this adjustment isnt overly critical in the 175—Thomas J Norton
