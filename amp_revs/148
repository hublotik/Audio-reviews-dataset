0,I used the topoftheline  system  to measure the Vincent SV236MK for some tests I also used an Audio Precision System One Dual DomainAs usual before performing any tests I ran the Vincent for 60 minutes at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage The measured distortionnoise was 0021 with the amplifier cold at the end of the hours preconditioning it had risen inconsequentially to 0022 and the heatsinks were around 60° ie just too hot to touch Unlike a number of amplifiers I have measured recently the Vincent has enough heatsink capacity for its specified output powerThe maximum voltage gain measured at the speaker terminals into 8 ohms was a high 4866dB Measured at the preamplifier output jacks the maximum gain was 181dB which is also somewhat on the high side The amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting from both sets of outputs The input impedance was lower than the specified 47k ohms but still fairly high at 41k ohms at low and middle frequencies It dropped slightly but inconsequentially to 36k ohms at 20kHz The source impedance from the preamplifier output jacks was a high 23k ohms at high and midrange frequencies rising to an even higher 41k ohms at 20Hz However the source impedance from the speaker terminals was a low 009 ohms over almost all the audioband rising slightly to 012 ohms at 20kHz As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker remained within ±01dB limits Fig1 was taken with the volume control at its maximum and the channel matching can be seen to be superb However at lower settings of the control an imbalance of up to 04dB appeared in favor of the left channel The Vincent amplifier has a wide smallsignal bandwidth its output not dropping by 3dB until 120kHz As a result its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured very short risetimes as well as a complete lack of overshoot or ringing  These  with the tone controls and Loudness defeated The top and bottom pairs of traces in fig3 show the effect on the SV236MKs smallsignal response of the Bass and Treble controls set to their maximum and minimum positions respectively The boosts and cuts are usefully moderate with the exception of the treble cut which is a bit too aggressive The central pair of traces in this graph show the Vincents response with the tone controls incircuit but set to their central detented positions Both the bass and treble regions suffer some boost in this condition The effect of the Loudness button is shown in fig4 The effect will vary with the volume control setting—it was set to –20dB or 100 for this measurement—but the treble boost does seem excessive compared with the lowfrequency boostFig1 Vincent SV236MK frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Vincent SV236MK smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Vincent SV236MK response with from top to bottom treble and bass controls set to maximum detented zero and minimum with volume control set to –20dB Fig4 Vincent SV236MK loudness contour with volume control set to –20dB Channel separation  was good rather than great at 70dB below 1kHz in both directions Perhaps as a result of its high gain the Vincent also offered modest signalnoise ratios With the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum  the unweighted wideband ratio ref 283V into 8 ohms  was just 635dB This improved to 684dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 706dB when Aweighted I suspect therefore that the specified 80dB was referenced to the amplifiers maximum power rather than to the usual 1WFig5 plots the THDnoise percentage in the Vincents output power against output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms With both channels driven the SV236MK meets its specified maximum power of 150Wpc into 8 ohms  at clipping  However it falls a little short into lower impedances delivering 231Wpc into 4 ohms rather than the specified 250Wpc  With one channel driven into 2 ohms the amplifier clipped at 362W  but didnt otherwise misbehave into this low impedanceFig5 Vincent SV236MK distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsThe traces in fig6 show how the THDN percentage changes with frequency I chose a fairly high level—20V RMS—to perform this set of measurements in order to be sure I was at a level where the actual distortion would not be buried within the noise There is only a slight increase in THD at the top of the audioband which suggests that the Vincent has quite a wide openloop bandwidth The distortion approximately doubles as the load impedance halves which is what I expected from fig5 But you can also see that the right channel  is significantly more linear than the left channel  Fig6 Vincent SV236MK THDN  vs frequency at 16V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The spectral content of the Vincent SV236MKs distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous secondharmonic in nature  though higherorder harmonics appear as higher powers  and output currents  This last graph also shows that the lessgood linearity of the left channel compared with the right is almost entirely due to an increase in the amount of third harmonic Note also in this graph the presence of AC powersupply components at 120Hz 180Hz 240Hz 420Hz etc Though these all lie beneath –90dB they do indicate that the amplifier is working close to the edge at these power levels These spuriae can also be seen as the rise in the noisefloor to the left of the spectrum in fig10 which analyzes the Vincents output as it drives an equal combination of 19kHz and 20kHz tones into 4 ohms at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen Actual intermodulation is fairly low however with a kHz difference component reaching –70dB  and all the higherorder components lying at or beneath –84dB Fig7 Vincent SV236MK 1kHz

spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 190W into 4 ohms Fig10 Vincent SV236MK HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 190W peak into 4 ohms The Vincent SV236MK measures well considering its 1995
