I used topoftheline system measure Vincent SV236MK tests I also used Audio Precision System One Dual DomainAs usual performing tests I ran Vincent 60 minutes onethird specified power 8 ohms thermally worst case amplifier classB AB output stage The measured distortionnoise 0021 amplifier cold end hours preconditioning risen inconsequentially 0022 heatsinks around 60° ie hot touch Unlike number amplifiers I measured recently Vincent enough heatsink capacity specified output powerThe maximum voltage gain measured speaker terminals 8 ohms high 4866dB Measured preamplifier output jacks maximum gain 181dB also somewhat high side The amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie noninverting sets outputs The input impedance lower specified 47k ohms still fairly high 41k ohms low middle frequencies It dropped slightly inconsequentially 36k ohms 20kHz The source impedance preamplifier output jacks high 23k ohms high midrange frequencies rising even higher 41k ohms 20Hz However source impedance speaker terminals low 009 ohms almost audioband rising slightly 012 ohms 20kHz As result modification amplifiers frequency response standard simulated loudspeaker remained within ±01dB limits Fig1 taken volume control maximum channel matching seen superb However lower settings control imbalance 04dB appeared favor left channel The Vincent amplifier wide smallsignal bandwidth output dropping 3dB 120kHz As result reproduction 10kHz squarewave featured short risetimes well complete lack overshoot ringing These tone controls Loudness defeated The top bottom pairs traces fig3 show effect SV236MKs smallsignal response Bass Treble controls set maximum minimum positions respectively The boosts cuts usefully moderate exception treble cut bit aggressive The central pair traces graph show Vincents response tone controls incircuit set central detented positions Both bass treble regions suffer boost condition The effect Loudness button shown fig4 The effect vary volume control setting—it set –20dB 100 measurement—but treble boost seem excessive compared lowfrequency boostFig1 Vincent SV236MK frequency response 283V simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig2 Vincent SV236MK smallsignal 10kHz squarewave 8 ohmsFig3 Vincent SV236MK response top bottom treble bass controls set maximum detented zero minimum volume control set –20dB Fig4 Vincent SV236MK loudness contour volume control set –20dB Channel separation good rather great 70dB 1kHz directions Perhaps result high gain Vincent also offered modest signalnoise ratios With input shorted volume control maximum unweighted wideband ratio ref 283V 8 ohms 635dB This improved 684dB measurement bandwidth restricted audioband 706dB Aweighted I suspect therefore specified 80dB referenced amplifiers maximum power rather usual 1WFig5 plots THDnoise percentage Vincents output power output power 8 4 2 ohms With channels driven SV236MK meets specified maximum power 150Wpc 8 ohms clipping However falls little short lower impedances delivering 231Wpc 4 ohms rather specified 250Wpc With one channel driven 2 ohms amplifier clipped 362W didnt otherwise misbehave low impedanceFig5 Vincent SV236MK distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 8 4 2 ohmsThe traces fig6 show THDN percentage changes frequency I chose fairly high level—20V RMS—to perform set measurements order sure I level actual distortion would buried within noise There slight increase THD top audioband suggests Vincent quite wide openloop bandwidth The distortion approximately doubles load impedance halves I expected fig5 But also see right channel significantly linear left channel Fig6 Vincent SV236MK THDN vs frequency 16V 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms The spectral content Vincent SV236MKs distortion predominantly subjectively innocuous secondharmonic nature though higherorder harmonics appear higher powers output currents This last graph also shows lessgood linearity left channel compared right almost entirely due increase amount third harmonic Note also graph presence AC powersupply components 120Hz 180Hz 240Hz 420Hz etc Though lie beneath –90dB indicate amplifier working close edge power levels These spuriae also seen rise noisefloor left spectrum fig10 analyzes Vincents output drives equal combination 19kHz 20kHz tones 4 ohms level visible clipping oscilloscope screen Actual intermodulation fairly low however kHz difference component reaching –70dB higherorder components lying beneath –84dB Fig7 Vincent SV236MK 1kHz waveform 48W 8 ohms 003 THDN distortion noise waveform fundamental notched Fig8 Vincent SV236MK spectrum 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz 100W 8 ohms Fig9 Vincent SV236MK spectrum 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz 190W 4 ohms Fig10 Vincent SV236MK HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz 190W peak 4 ohms The Vincent SV236MK measures well considering 1995 price
