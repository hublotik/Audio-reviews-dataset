0, Western Electric 91E  I carefully installed the tubes following the instructions in the excellent manual and after turning on the amplifier waited for the 91E to optimize the bias for the 300B output tubes Once that was done I waited another 30 minutes before starting the testingThe Western Electric 91E preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting from its loudspeaker preamplifier and headphone outputs The volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps A level of 1Wpc into 8 ohms was indicated as approximately –12dB on the frontpanel meters The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was a fairly low 296dB measured at the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms 197dB from the headphone output and –001dB from the preamplifier output ie an input of 1V resulted in an output of 9985mV The singleended input impedance is specified as 20k ohms I measured an inconsequentially lower value of 165k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 155k ohms at 20kHzThe headphone outputs source impedance was a relatively high 113 ohms across the audioband which wont be optimal for lowimpedance headphones The loudspeaker output impedance was a high 33 ohms at 20Hz falling slightly to 257 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz The variation in the Western Electric amplifiers smallsignal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was ±14dB which would be audible Into resistive loads  the VTA70 started to roll off above 10kHz reaching –3dB at 35kHz Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control The 91Es reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  was superbly square The ultrasonic rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  though no overshoot or ringing is presentFig1 Western Electric 91E frequency

into 8 ohmsThe 91Es channel separation  was 60dB in both directions below 2kHz but decreased to 40dB at 20kHz The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  taken with the input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was a good 797dB  This ratio improved to 861dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 906dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the Western Electric amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to maximum  revealed a low level of random noise and the ACrelated spuriae at 60Hz and its odd and evenorder harmonics lay at or below –90dBFig4 Western Electric 91E spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum  Western Electric specifies the 91Es maximum power into 8 ohms as 20Wpc  at 10 THD 16Wpc  at 5 THD and 14Wpc  at 3 THD  With our usual definition of clipping—when the THDnoise reaches 1—and with both channels driven I measured a clipping power of just 18Wpc into 8 ohms  At 3 THDN I measured 923Wpc  and at 10 128Wpc  Slightly more power was available into 4 ohms  48Wpc  at 1 THDN 10Wpc  at 3 THDN and 14Wpc  at 10 THDN The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifier uses a very limited amount of loop negative feedbackFig5 Western Electric 91E distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Western Electric 91E distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 shows how the percentage of THDN in both channels varied with frequency into 8 and 4 ohms at 1V The THDN rose slightly at the frequency extremes and was higher in the left channel into 8 ohms  but in the right channel into 4 ohms  At 283V which is equivalent to 1W into 8 ohms  the distortion was close to 1 in both channelsFig7 Western Electric 91E THDN  vs frequency at 1V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig8 Western Electric 91E THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fortunately the distortion waveform  was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  at 08 The third harmonic was also present albeit at a lower level especially into 4 ohms  By themselves the second and third harmonics may not result in audible distortion even at relatively high levels However this will only be true if they are not accompanied by intermodulation distortion With the 91E driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 4 ohms  the 1kHz difference product lay at –50dB  with the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz 10dB lower in level These products were all 5dB higher in level at 1W into 8 ohms  which experience leads me to believe is marginal performance It is fair to note however that this level of intermodulation is identical to that of the Air Tight ATM300R power amplifier that Art Dudley favorably reviewed in February 2019  which also used a single 300B tube for each channels outputFig9 Western Electric 91E left channel 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms 08 THDN

DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 1Wpc peak into 4 ohms  behavior of the Western Electrics phono input I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the rear panel to obtain the lowest noise The phono input inverted absolute polarity at all the outputs I measured a maximum gain at 1kHz at the loudspeaker outputs of 715dB  and 821dB  I performed all the subsequent testing using the headphone output and with the volume control set to –95dB to avoid overloading the tubed output stage  I repeated some of the testing at the preamplifier outputThe input impedance was 42k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 343k ohms at 20kHz  and 993 ohms at 20Hz 979 ohms at 1kHz 968 ohms at 20kHz  The phono inputs RIAA error was very low with very good channel matching  though the low and high frequencies rolled off a little reaching –1dB at 35Hz and 20kHz Set to MM the wideband unweighted SN ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a good 67dB  ref 1kHz at 5mV Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 797dB while an Aweighting filter further increased the ratio to 842dB The SN ratios in MC mode were 10–12dB lower but this is still a relatively quiet phono stageFig12 Western Electric 91E phono input response with RIAA correction  The phono input measured at the headphone output had high levels of distortion with the second harmonic the highest in level at –44dB  with an input signal of 5mV The harmonic distortion signature is very similar to that measured at the loudspeaker outputs which makes me suspect that the headphone output is derived from the singleended tubed output stage most likely with a series resistor I therefore repeated the spectral analysis at the preamplifier output  Though highorder harmonics are visible these all lie at or below –90dB  and the second harmonic is now almost 50dB lower than it had been from the headphone outputFig13 Western Electric 91E MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz for 5mV input measured at headphone output Fig14 Western Electric 91E MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz for 5mV input measured at Preamplifier output The high level of second harmonic distortion present in the headphone output affected the overload margin measurements In MM mode the margins calculated from the difference between the nominal 1kHz input level of 5mV and the input voltage where the THDN reached 1 were disappointing at 34dB at 20Hz 42dB at 1kHz and –84dB at 20kHz The margins in MC mode ref 1kHz at 05mV were all 05dB lower However repeating the overload margin measurements at the preamplifier output gave an 8dB improvement at 20Hz and 1kHz in both MM and MC mode though the margins at 20kHz were still lowThe Western Electric 91E is an intriguing mix of modern technology—the computeroptimized tube biasing the precision volume control the frontpanel meters—and almostcenturyold tube technology Its measured performance is what I would expect from an amplifier with a singleended output stage that uses a single 300B tube Given its high levels of both harmonic and intermodulation distortion even at lowish powers it will work best with loudspeakers that have a 4 ohm nominal impedance and high sensitivity Footnote 1 Kudos to Western Electric for reporting the THD level at which maximum output power is measured—Jim AustinFootnote 2 I created tracks on Stereophiles Test CD 2 so listeners could hear at what percentage of second third or seventh harmonic they become aware of the distortion See
