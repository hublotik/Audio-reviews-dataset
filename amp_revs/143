0,Sidebar Measurements Rega Brio   Via its line inputs the Brios maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was typical for an integrated amplifier at 3955dB The amplifier inverted absolute polarity for line input signals at both the speaker terminals and headphone jack and its input impedance at 20Hz and 1kHz was at 41k ohms fairly close to the specified 47k ohms Though the line input impedance dropped to 36k ohms at 20kHz this will be inconsequentialThe headphone output impedance was a high 107 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz so will not be optimal with lowimpedance headphones However the output impedance at the speaker terminals was very low measuring just 006 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to a stilllow 015 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the change in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker due to the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and that of the load was minimal  and there was very little difference between the response into 8 ohms  and those into lower impedances However this graph reveals the Brio to have a relatively limited smallsignal bandwidth the –3dB point lying at 41kHz This results in increased risetimes in the Regas reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  although commendably no overshoot or ringing can be seen The traces in fig1 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum at lower settings of the control there are no changes either in the response or in the superb channel matchingFig1 Rega Brio frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Rega Brio smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was good though it was greater from right to left than in the other direction those crosstalks respectively lying at –78 and –65dB The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio taken with the line inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum—the worst possible case—was okay at 655dB ref 1W into 8 ohms Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased the ratio to 6935dB while switching an Aweighting filter into circuit resulted in further improvement to 722dB  Fig3 indicates that the measured SN ratios are due to both random noise and spuriae at the powersupply–related frequency of 60Hz and its harmonicsFig3 Rega Brio spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Specified as offering maximum powers of 50Wpc into 8 ohms  and 73Wpc into 4 ohms  both channels driven the Brio actually delivered slightly more power at clipping which we define as when the level of THDnoise in the amplifiers output reaches 1 Figs 4 and 5 show how the percentage of THDN changes with output power into respectively 8 and 4 ohms You can see that while the Brio offers very low THDN it does clip quite sharply reaching 1 THDN at 52Wpc into 8 ohms  and 80Wpc into 4 ohms Fig4 Rega Brio both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Rega Brio both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsTo be certain I was looking at actual THD rather than noise I plotted  the way the THDN percentage changed with frequency at a fairly high level 89V which is equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms and 20W into 4 ohms Even so the percentage at low and middle frequencies was very low—much lower than what I found with the original Brio which Wes Phillips reviewed in 1998 But as with that early Brio the THDN increased in the top octaves presumably due to the circuit having limited opencircuit loop gain This means that the amount of corrective negative feedback available decreases as the frequency rises and to a greater extent in the right channel  than in the left Fig6 Rega Brio THDN  vs frequency at 89V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion itself is heavily secondharmonic in nature  which would be benign even if it were a lot higher than it is in the Regas output  However this graph reveals that some higherorder harmonics are present particularly in the left channel  where theyre almost as high in level as the second—if you can refer to anything at or below –94dB  as high Despite the decreasing linearity in the top audio octave the Brio did relatively well when I fed it an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible waveform clipping into 4 ohms  When I repeated this test at 1W into 8 ohms  the difference product at 1kHz lay at just –84dB Fig7 Rega Brio 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms 0029 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Rega Brio spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20W

input offered 399dB of gain measured at the Tape Out jacks and 796dB at the speaker terminals with the volume control set to its maximum The input impedance was 44k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to 36k ohms at 20kHz Both the gain and impedance are appropriate for movingmagnet cartridges The phono input inverted polarity at the speaker terminals but preserved polarity at the Tape Out jacksThe RIAA equalization  was superbly accurate with a slight downward slope in the upper bass and the two channels very closely matched Channel separation was also excellent and the Brios phono input was very quiet the unweighted wideband SN ratio  measuring 688dB This improved to 799dB with an Aweighting filter in circuitFig11 Rega Brio phono input response with RIAA correction  Phono overload margins were superb at 27dB at 20Hz and 1kHz and though the margin decreased to 245dB at 20kHz this is still excellent I had to raise the input level at 1kHz to 21mV to see what distortion harmonics were present even at this level only the second and third harmonics could be seen  and these respectively lay at –106 and –114dB  Intermodulation distortion was also extraordinarily low

wellsorted little amplifier as the Brits say and I was especially impressed by its movingmagnet phono stage But it runs hot after 60 minutes of driving onethird its clipping power into 8 ohms the temperature of its side panels was 1356°F
