BK Components AV302 Power Amplifier The AV302 discontinued available used market low price I told I found one listing asking price 175 others The good news uses ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE classD amplifier module review relevant amplifiers market nowThe BK amp targeted CI market meaning usually installed home businesses dealerinstaller part larger system This amp example could hidden behind flat panel TV powering couple speakers For reason formfactor connectivity follows requirements marketHere front panelThe business end backAs tell fair amount connectivity home automation I investigate I imagine power unit remotely say synchronise TV turned onoffI liked level control channels It buttery smooth putting many volume controls shame Using I able get perfect match two channels something cant hardly modern amplifier anymoreThe speaker connections use phoenix connectors super common CI industry greatest choice It easy outputs short left copper sticking screw terminal In use connector make tight enough connection causing performance one channel vary much 20 dB It tight feel noise level would go I wiggled For intended application probably matter If want use hifi home application may want hard wire run issue I didIn use unit barely got warm touch There plenty ventilation top bottom helps regard high efficiency switchmode power supply classd amplification modulePower Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere usual dashboard 5 watt 4 ohmI adjusted output gain 29 dB means controls near max Performance may vary lower gain values I used 29 dB since probably commonTHX recommended gain levelTHDN 0008 The 50ASX2SE spec I recall less half 0003 The discrepancy may due gain stage connector variation units Overall ballpark advertise This translates SINAD midpoint amplifiers testedSignal noise ratio good enough 16bit audio playback 98 dB full powerOn right measurement relative max 5 watts SNR drop much goodFrequency response dead flat audible band quite wellbehaved output filteringWideband FFT spectrum shows ugliness typically see classd amps probably uglier normal pictureMore visual scare though audioMost important measurement amplifier power versus distortion noise Lets start common load 4 ohmAs see one channel started deviate I said introduction But still smooth wellbehaved giving us power rating 42 watts hard clipping sets inAt 8 ohm power level drops lot would expectFunny though much lower noise distortion AV302 compared NAD T758 AV Receiver Would good replacement power If modules higher range performance may good application power home theatersThat said modules almost headroom peak power almost averageThis unlike class AB amplifiers power supply classD amps regulated storage output caps cant provide juice short periods Another sign good design performance amplifier varies level frequencyEach line pair color different frequency An ideal amplifier would care frequency graphs would land top Here vary much less amplifiers I measuredConclusionsThe BK AV302 provides competent performance across suite measurements It runs cool efficient small It easily outperforms mass market AVRs example Alas lot power desktop speaker application I would seek something powerfulOverall I going put BK AV302 implication ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE recommended list midlevel performance amplification
