0, Yamaha WXA50 multifunction DAC preamp power amp streaming and multiroom unit Even though it came out a few years ago  it is widely available Amazon shows it costs US 478Success of SONOS as a multiroom audio solution has been the envy of many traditional audio companies Many have tried to chase them with Yamaha being one of the earlier onesThe WXA50 is a surprisingly heavy unit although looks somewhat unremarkableThe case is metal as best as I can tell which is good as the unit generates good bit of heat Strangely the heat is concentrated on the left side yet the vents are on the right There is an IR hole on the left which confused me to no end constantly wanting to push it to turn on the unit I am not a fan of a single light indicating input and overload condition of the amplifier Worst part of the interface is the volume control which has no marking and no display Unless you use the app you have no idea what volume you have set this to This made my testing maddeningly hardI downloaded the App and here I was pleasantly surprised by the performance and reliability of it With no configuration the WXA50 was recognized and manipulating its controls were instantaneous and reliable I only used the App to reset the EQ etc so for its full functionality you should seek out other reviewsThe back panel has extensive set of inputs and outputs although lacks USBI was pleased to see both analog input and outputsYamaha heavily courted the Custom Install  industry to use this instead of SONOS and it shows from inclusion of trigger input and output for control Inclusion of Toslink input goes along these lines to fetch audio from a TV being fed by HDMIDAC Audio MeasurementsI briefly measured DAC performance I read however that there are two DAC chips inside this unit  and that the fixed output is driven by the latter So this may not be representative of what happens when you stream music into this deviceThis is decent performance although it degraded fair bit if I turned up the volume on the amplifier to max That increased the higher order harmonics even though the output level of the DAC did not change We have seen this before and likely is the power supply sagging causing DAC performance to suffer SInce you dont listen at max volume level I did not derate the WXA50 performance when including it in the performance chartAmplifier Audio MeasurementsSince we have analog inputs I started my testing using that and got this for our usual dashboard at roughly 5 wattsI played around with combination of input levels and volume control and performance was pretty consistent SINAD  is actually quite respectable for an amplifier same this time using Roon to stream the 1 kHz tone to it using AirplayWe lose just a couple of dBs although distortion levels are a bit lowerFrom here on  unit using its analog input unless specifiedFrequency response shows decent bandwidth and flat response in audible bandNo strange and limiting digitization of input is visible which is goodSignal to noise ratio is good enough for 16 bit audioLets get into all important measurement power into 4 ohm versus distortionWe are close to meeting the spec  We have cleaner power than either Sonos or Amazon amps although the SONOS has much more powerHere is the performance at 8 ohmI dont have as much data for 8 ohm but what is there shows competent performance but with just 55 watts on tapIntermodulation distortion versus power level tells a similar storyTHDN versus frequency and power shows very predictable performance with no corner cases exposedOnly 20 Hz tones gives it a bit of trouble with rising distortion above 10 watts but that is slightThe unit also shut down at 20 kHz at max clipping level I reduced the volume level a few notches and that went away even though I was still pushing the unit into hard clippingSpectrum of 1 kHz tone with no AES filter shows the usual noise in high frequencies we get from classD ampsWhile this looks ugly the spikes near audio band are way down at 75 dB which is very good I have tested amps where these levels are much much higherThe two channels have different switching frequencies Not sure if this is on purpose or variation in the clock source of their modulators The two beat against each other likely creating the intermodulation spikes that we see throughout the rangeConclusionsUnlike the bag of parts performance I often see in these modern streaming products the Yamaha WXA50 seems to have benefited from some attention to raw performance of each subsystem There are no funny results strange pipelines that go in and out of digital domain etc The performance graphs are all smooth with no sudden jaggies or other anomalies This makes it easier to use the unit not having to work around its weakness We also have decent amount of power approaching 100 watts into 4 ohm which should be plenty If you add the subwoofer to it you will be golden even at high SPLsThe app likewise gives a feeling of polish that I often find lacking in competing productsIn summary I did not raise an eyebrow when measuring the Yamaha WXA50 It wont provide competition to stateoftheart separate products but it also doesnt embarrass As such I am going to put the WXA50 on my recommended listQuestions comments critique etc are welcomeI was reading that the standard diet for panthers is large animals such as deer antelope etc I have not fed anything like that to my panthers and they are starting to mumble animal abuse under the lips Before this gets out of hand please
