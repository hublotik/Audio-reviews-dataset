0, Audio Note Meishu Phono Tonmeister  The tubes were already installed when I received the review sample I removed the cover to check for proper installation All was well I waited for 30 minutes after powering up the amplifier before starting the testingLooking first at its line inputs the Meishu Tonmeister preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting from both the 4 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was a moderately low 2965dB from the 4 ohm tap into 8 ohms and 313dB from the 8 ohm tap into the same load The input impedance is specified as 100k ohms I measured a stillhigh 77k ohms at 20Hz 745k ohms at 1kHz and 637k ohms at 20kHzThe source impedance from the 8 ohm output tap was a high 32 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing slightly to 345 ohms at 20kHz The variation in the smallsignal frequency response with this output with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was therefore high at ±18dB The variation was lower from the 4 ohm tap at ±11dB  but with both output taps there will be audible modifications of loudspeaker responses with almost all loudspeakers Into resistive loads  the Audio Note amplifiers output started to roll off below 40Hz and above 20kHz reaching –3dB at 9Hz and 55kHz Figs1  2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control There is the slightest hint of a resonant peak at 60kHz in the Meishu Tonmeisters frequency response which correlated with some damped ultrasonic ringing in the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms Fig1 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono line input 8 ohm output tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono line input 4 ohm output tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig3 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 8 ohm output tap smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Meishu Tonmeisters channel separation  was moderate at 49dB R–L and 36dB L–R at 1kHz respectively decreasing to 23dB and 40dB at 20kHz The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  taken from the 8 ohm taps with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was 697dB  This ratio improved slightly to 715dB left and 696dB right when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 867dB when Aweighted With their lower gain the ratios from the 4 ohm outputs were 13dB greaterSpectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the Audio Notes 8 ohm taps drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum  revealed a low level of random noise However AC supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd and evenorder harmonics were present The highest of these at 120Hz lay at –76dB  Its level didnt change when I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzerFig4 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 8 ohm output tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum  Audio Note specifies the Meishu Tonmeisters maximum power as 8W into both 4 and 8 ohms  though no distortion percentage is mentioned With our usual definition of clipping—when the THDnoise reaches 1—and with both channels driven I measured a clipping power of just 1Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms  and from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  At 3 THDN I measured 48Wpc with each output tap matched to the load and at 10 122Wpc from the 8 ohm tap  and from the 4 ohm tap  again with the taps matched to the loads Less power was available from the 8 ohm tap into 4 ohms but with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  575Wpc was available at 3 THDN and 10Wpc at 10  The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifiers circuit doesnt use loop negative feedback It is also fair to note that the waveform wasnt actually clipped at these high levels of distortion instead it was asymmetrically rounded offFig5 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 8 ohm output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 4 ohm output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 4 ohm output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFigs5–7 indicate that the lowest distortion at low power is obtained from the 4 ohm transformer tap Fig8 shows how the percentage of THDN in both channels varied with frequency with this tap driving 8 and 4 ohms at 1V The THDN rose slightly at low frequencies and was significantly higher into 4 ohms  than it was into 8 ohms  At the same level from the 8 ohm tap  the distortion across the audioband was close to 05 into 8 ohms and 1 into 4 ohmsFig8 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 4 ohm output tap THDN  vs frequency at 1V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig9 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 8 ohm output tap THDN  vs frequency at 1V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion waveform  was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic with higherorder harmonics progressively lower in level  However the levels of the third fifth and seventh harmonics were higher at low frequencies  which will probably be due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformersFig10 Audio Note

ohm output tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 1V into 8 ohms Fig12 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 4 ohm output tap spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1V into 8 ohms Due to masking in itself the level of the second harmonic may not result in audible distortion but this will only be true if it is not accompanied by intermodulation distortion With the Meishu Tonmeisters 4 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  the 1kHz difference product lay just below –50dB  with the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz 10dB lower in level This is marginal performance in my opinionFig13 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono 8 ohm output tap HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 1Wpc peak into 4ohms  behavior of the Audio Notes phono input I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the amplifiers chassis ground post on its rear panel to obtain the lowest noise The phono input preserved absolute polarity and the maximum gain at 1kHz was 678dB at the 8 ohm outputs and 6614dB at the 4 ohm outputs The gain was fixed at 364dB at the singleended Source output so to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stage  phono inputs behavior at the Source output with the volume control set to its minimumThe input impedance is specified as 47k ohms I measured 48k ohms at 20Hz 375k ohms at 1kHz but just 8k ohms at 20kHz The phono inputs RIAA equalization was very accurate with excellent channel matching  though the low frequencies rolled off a little reaching –3dB at 16Hz The wideband unweighted SN ratio with the inputs shorted to ground was a good 64dB in both channels ref 1kHz at 5mV Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 689dB while an Aweighting filter further increased the ratio to 76dB Negligible power supply–related spuriae were present in the phono stages noisefloor  this is a relatively quiet phono stageFig14 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono phono input response with RIAA correction measured at Source output  Fig15 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz for 5mV input measured at Source output The lowfrequency and midrange overload margins calculated from the difference between the nominal 1kHz input level of 5mV and the input voltage where the THDN reached 1 were superbly high at 378dB at 20Hz and 32dB at 1kHz The margin at 20kHz was lower at 14dB The phono inputs harmonic distortion was respectably low in level with the second harmonic the highest in level at –60dB  With the relatively low overload margin at the top of the audioband I wasnt surprised to find that the secondorder difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones peaking at 25mV lay at –40dB  Highorder intermodulation products were vanishingly low in level however until I increased the signal level by 10dBFig16 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz for

performance is what I would expect from an amplifier with a singleended output stage that uses a single 300B tube for each channel In this respect its behavior resembles that of the Western Electric Type No91E integrated amplifier that Ken Micallef reviewed in November 2022
