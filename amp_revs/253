0, Peachtree Nova 300 integrated amplifier with DAC and phono stage   costs US 2199 The Nova 300 fits in the same chassis Peachtree has successfully used for last 15 yearsIt is quite beefy and heavy Volume indication overloads the LED indicators on the input selectors showing a coarse 8 levels For this price I would expect an LED indicator of the actual levelBack panel shows good quality connectors and rich feature set for a desktop amplifierPeachtree made its name on DACs and had quite a following 10 to 15 years ago I was curious to see if they had upgraded the DAC subsystem since that time so lets start by measuring that subsystemPeachtree Nova 300 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit over USB input sampled the output from preamp out and adjusted the volume to output 2 voltsWell this is quite disappointing Noise and distortion as represented by SINAD is in decidedly poor category in todays marketThe unit can output higher levels so lets see where peak performance isNo luck there as the peak is actually at 1 volt outDynamic range is better indicating distortion is the problemAt this point I didnt see a need to run more DAC tests and switched to testing the amplifierPeachtree Nova 300 Amplifier MeasurementsFor this test I used the Aux analog inputAh this is very respectable and above average performanceSNR is not as good as I like at 5 watt but gets better at full powerCrosstalk is excellentFrequency response shows a peaky filter thoughMultitone results indicate good enough performanceWhat was most impressive is the amount of power available from the ICE amplifier module they are usingSince I am driving two channels this is over 900 watts of power Indeed the peaks hit 1000 wattsEven at 8 ohm there is copious amount of power availableInteresting to see little dependency on frequency until we hit a few wattsConclusionsIt is clear from the measurements that the DAC subsystem is a relic that is simply behind times The product though benefits from using a competent BO ICE module which has stayed competitive producing far more power than you would expect in a lifestyle product of this kind As such I expect subjective performance of Nova 300 to be excellent regardless of what speaker you attach to it I usually dont worry about priceperformance in my reviews  that is yours to worry about  But here the price seems quite high relative to the other internet focused amplifiers which have come out in the last couple of years Some of those are powerful and all of them cost a lot less than the Nova 300Overall I cant recommend the Peachtree Nova 300 as a new purchase
