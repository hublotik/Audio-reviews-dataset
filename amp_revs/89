0,Prior to measuring the Pass Labs INT25  I preconditioned it for an hour at onethird power into 8 ohms At the end of that time the heatsinks on the amplifiers sides were hot at 122°F  as was the top panel at 1166°F  Owners should make sure this amplifier is wellventilated The amplifiers maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was 254dB and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity The Pass Labs input impedance is specified as 47k ohms I measured 46k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 37k ohms at 20kHz The small reduction at the top of the audioband will be inconsequential The output impedance was very low at 006 ohms at low and middle frequencies rising very slightly to 008 ohms at the top of the audioband  Consequently the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was minimal The response into impedances of 4 and 8 ohms  was flat up to 20kHz and the output into 2 ohms  was down by just 025dB at 20kHz The ultrasonic rolloff varied with the load impedance the –3dB point was close to 200kHz into higher impedances but dropped to 100kHz into 2 ohms The traces in fig1 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum Commendably the frequency response didnt change at lower settings of the volume control and the already good channel matching improved The Pass Labs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  featured very short risetimes and no ringing though there was a very slight hint of overshootFig1 Pass Labs INT25 frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Pass Labs INT25 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was very good but asymmetrical at 77dB R–L and 90dB L–R below 1kHz Both figures dropped to close to 60dB at the top of the audioband however The wideband unweighted SN ratio ref 283V and measured with the volume control set to its maximum and the input shorted to ground was 751dB  which improved to 832dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 869dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the INT25s noise floor  revealed a low level of random noise but spuriae related to the powerline frequency were present at low levels The 60Hz component which will be due to magnetic interference from the power transformer was highest in level at –76dBFig3 Pass Labs INT25 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The INT25s output power is specified as 25W into 8 ohms and 50W into 4 ohms both equivalent to 14dBW with a classA envelope of 50W peak into 2 4 or 8 ohm loads With clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 I found that the Pass Labs amplifier with both channels driven at 1kHz clipped at 60W into 8 ohms  and 98W into 4 ohms  Fig6 shows how the INT25s THDN percentage varied with frequency at a moderate output voltage of 895V which is equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms 20W into 4 ohms and 40W into 2 ohms While the Pass Labs offered very low distortion at all frequencies into 8 ohms  with only a small increase at the top of the audioband the distortion at this output level increased dramatically above the midrange into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  It is possible that this behavior is associated with the amplifiers output stage moving out of the classA bias conditionFig4 Pass Labs INT25 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Pass Labs INT25 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Pass Labs INT25 THDN  vs frequency at 895V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The waveform of the residual distortion and noise with a 1kHz signal at this voltage into 8 ohms  is dominated by the subjectively benign second harmonic This was confirmed by spectral analysis  though it is appropriate to note that the second harmonic lies at a very low –86dB  Higherorder harmonics are virtually absent though the lowlevel power supply–related spuriae can be seen in this graph Both highorder intermodulation products and the secondorder difference product with the INT25 driving an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 10W into 8 ohms were very low in level  However as expected from fig6 repeating this test at the same output voltage into 4 ohms produced high levels of intermodulation distortion I had to reduce the peak output level to 632V into 4 ohms equivalent to 10W into this load to get a similar spectrum to that shown in fig9Fig7 Pass Labs INT25 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms 00092 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Pass Labs INT25 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 10W into 8 ohms Fig9 Pass Labs INT25 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms There is much to admire in the Pass Labs INT25s measured performance However its intolerance in the treble for loads of 4 ohms and below means it will work best with loudspeakers whose impedance doesnt drop below 8 ohms at high frequencies
