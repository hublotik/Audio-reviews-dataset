0, Exposure 2010S by running a 1kHz sinewave at 25Wpc into 8 ohms for an hour After 30 minutes the chassis was very hot with even the volume control too hot to touch The amplifier didnt shut down however The distortion level was initially 0035 at this power level rising slightly at the end of the preconditioning period to 0048Looking first at the preamp output this offered a maximum gain of 1715dB rather than the specified 18dB sourced from a low 69 ohms impedance  The preamp output didnt invert absolute polarity and neither did the main speaker outputs The amplifier itself offered a maximum gain into 8 ohms of 4083dB and its input impedance was 185k ohms over most of the audioband dropping slightly to 16k ohms at 20kHzThe 2010Ss output impedance was a moderately high 033 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 036 ohm at 20kHz As a result the interaction between this impedance and that of our simulated loudspeaker resulted in a response variation of ±025dB which might be just audible  This graph also shows that like earlier Exposure designs the 2010S has a curtailed ultrasonic response  which results in an output down 075dB at the top of the audioband Note the channel imbalance in fig1 the volume control was set to 1200 for this set of measurements and the right channel is 025dB louder than the left at this settingFig1 Exposure 2010S frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms This imbalance decreased to 005dB but now favoring the left channel with the control set to its maximum position but increased to 06dB with the control at 900 However the amplifiers overall frequency response was identical at all settings of the volume control something that is becoming rare in highend amplifier design The rolloff above the audioband resulted in lengthened risetimes in the Exposures reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  However it performed superbly with a 1kHz squarewave Fig2 Exposure 2010S smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Exposure 2010S smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was an adequate 66dB over most of the audioband decreasing to 63dB at 20kHz Of more practical concern was the crosstalk between adjacent inputs While better than 70dB below 300Hz with the undriven input unloaded the separation decreased to 40dB at 20kHz Depending on the source components impedance the Exposures owner might hear a wispy trace of whatever is plugged into the adjacent input It might be a good idea to plug shorting RCA plugs into unused inputsThe Exposures signalnoise ratio was good rather than great at 69dB  ref 1W into 8 ohms this improving to 757dB when Aweighted Both figures were taken with the input shorted and the volume control set to its maximum  However I did note the presence of some lowlevel 120Hz hum that I couldnt eliminate by experimenting with the grounding between the amplifier and my Audio Precision test set as well as some verylowfrequency noise below 5Hz though this too was at a very low levelDelivering 81W into 8 ohms  with both channels continuously driven at the 1 THDnoise clipping point  the Exposure 2010S exceeded its specified power by 035dB It gave 105W into 4 ohms  again at 1 THDN Into 2 ohms however with one channel driven the amplifier went into protection at 103W  this indicated by the premature cutoff of the relevant trace in fig4 Turning the amplifier off then on restored normal operationFig4 Exposure 2010S distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsAt low power levels into 8 ohms the harmonic distortion remained below 005 below 10kHz and rose slightly above that frequency  It more than doubled into 4 and 2 ohms but was still less than 01 below the top audio octave The presence of some lowlevel 120Hz hum results in the notch at that frequency in this graph the hum being out of phase with the signalFig5 Exposure 2010S THDN vs frequency at 485V into  8 4 2 ohms Of more subjective importance than the absolute level of an amplifiers distortion is its spectrum The waveform of the smallsignal THDN residual  indicates a mix of second and third harmonics though at low frequencies and high powers  the second harmonic is highest in level at –68dB  The powersupply components at 120Hz and 240Hz can be seen in this graph at –72dB  and –80dB  respectively When asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 4 ohms just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen the Exposure produced rather more intermodulation components than I expected The 1kHz difference tone lay at –56dB  whether the amplifier was driving 8 or 4 ohms Fig6 Exposure 2010S 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  0055 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig7 Exposure 2010S spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 95W into 4 ohms Fig8 Exposure 2010S HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 110W peak into 4 ohms That aside and taking into account its relatively low price the Exposure 2010S offers a sensible set of engineering compromises However nothing in these measurements indicates why it should sound as good as it does
