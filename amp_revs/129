0,I performed measurements on the Roksan Attessa   amplifier by operating it at 18 power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the top panels temperature was 1084°F424°C and that of the grille over the heatsinks almost too hot to touch at 1344°F559°C The Attessa needs sufficient ventilationLooking first at the linelevel analog Variable Input and with the sensitivity set to Low with the MaestroUnite app the Roksan Attessas maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was 349dB from the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms 585dB from the Pre output and 1185dB from the headphone output with the sensitivity set to Mid The amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie it was noninverting from its loudspeaker headphone and Pre outputs The input impedance was 25k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 236k ohms at 20kHzThe headphone outputs source impedance was a usefully low 6 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz From the Pre output the impedance was 23 ohms again at all audio frequencies The loudspeaker output impedance was a very low 009 ohms at low and middle frequencies increasing very slightly to 017 ohms at the top of the audioband The variation in the Roksan amplifiers smallsignal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±01dB  Into resistive loads  the Attessas frequency response rolled off above the audioband The fastest rolloff was into 2 ohms  the output being down by 3dB at 39kHz There is the beginning of a boost at frequencies below 20Hz in this graph the measurements in our sister magazine HiFi News indicated that this boost reached 92dB at 3HzFig1 Roksan Attessa frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control with all three outputs I found no overshoot or ringing with the Attessas reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  The Attessas channel separation  was 80dB in both directions below 3kHz decreasing slightly to 68dB at 20kHzFig2 Roksan Attessa smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  taken with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was 665dB  improving to 717dB left and 684dB right when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and by another 24dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the Roksan amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum  revealed the presence of ACrelated spuriae at 60Hz and its odd and evenorder harmonics These were higher in the right channel  than the left  correlating with the different SN ratios in the two channels The levels of these spuriae didnt change when I repeated the analysis with the volume control set to –12dB though the level of random noise dropped by the same 12dBFig3 Roksan Attessa spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum  Roksan specifies the Attessas maximum power as 80Wpc into 8 ohms  and 130Wpc into 4 ohms  With clipping defined as being when the THDnoise reaches 1 I measured clipping powers of 80Wpc into 8 ohms  and 128Wpc into 4 ohms  with both channels driven  The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the actual distortion lies beneath the noisefloor below clippingFig4 Roksan Attessa distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Roksan Attessa distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 shows how the percentage of THDN in both channels varied with frequency into 8 and 4 ohms at 1264V which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms  and 40W into 4 ohms  The THDN was very low into both impedances though a little higher in the right channel  than the left  The distortion waveform was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  which lay close to the level of the AC supply–related spuriae  Intermodulation distortion was also very low in level Fig6 Roksan Attessa THDN  vs frequency at 1264V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig7 Roksan Attessa left channel 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms 004 THDN  distortion and

into 4 ohms Turning to the digital inputs the coaxial SPDIF input accepted data sampled at all rates up to 192kHz TosLink was restricted to 96kHz data All the digital inputs preserved absolute polarity With the volume control set to its maximum data representing a 1kHz tone at –20dBFS resulted in a level of 8192mV at the headphone output 1147V at the speaker outputs  All the following measurements were performed at the headphone outputFig10 shows the Attessas impulse response with 441kHz data It is typical of a short minimumphase reconstruction filter with a small amount of ringing following the single fullscale sample With 441kHz whitenoise data  the filter rolled off slowly above the audioband not reaching full stopband attenuation until 31kHz but with then a scalloped noisefloor With a 191kHz tone at –3dBFS  the slow rolloff means that the aliased image at 25kHz is only suppressed by 9dB and other lowerlevel aliased products can be seen both in the audioband and between 60kHz and 70kHz The harmonics associated with the 191kHz tone are all very low in level however The Roksans frequency responses with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHz  all followed the same basic shape with a 1dB rolloff at 20kHzFig10 Roksan Attessa impulse response Fig11 Roksan Attessa wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at –3dBFS  into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz Fig12 Roksan Attessa frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  and 192kHz  The red trace in fig13 plots the error in the analog output level as a 24bit 1kHz digital tone steps down from 0dBFS to –140dBFS The amplitude error is negligible until the signal lies below –120dBFS An increase in bit depth from 16 to 24 with dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  dropped the level of the Attessas noisefloor by 12dB which implies a DAC resolution of around 18 bits With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS the waveform was symmetrical with the three DC voltage levels described by the data cleanly resolved  Repeating the measurement with undithered 24bit data gave a wellformed if rather noisy sinewave

implied by the blue and cyan traces in fig11 harmonic distortion via the digital inputs was very low the second harmonic of a fullscale 50Hz tone lying at –104dB  left and –114dB  right  With an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones sampled at 441kHz and peaking at 0dBFS a large number of highlevel aliased images were present Reducing the signal level by 3dB eliminated most of these images leaving those at 241kHz and 251kHz the highest in level  and all the others at or below –90dBFSFig17 Roksan Attessa 24bit TosLink data spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms Fig18 Roksan

LSBlevel squarewave mostly lay a little higher than the correct levels these indicated by the sloping green line in fig19 While the levels of the sidebands at ±2296875Hz are much higher repeating this test with data sent to the Attessa over my network with BluOS lowered these two sidebands by 10dBFig19 Roksan Attessa highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled

The phono inputs audioband RIAA correction was superbly accurate  though with a slight rise in the very low bass The input impedance measured 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping slightly to 40k ohms at 20kHz The maximum gain at 1kHz with the sensitivity set to Mid with the MaestroUnite app was 555dB at the Pre output 614dB at the headphone output and 845dB at the loudspeaker outputs I performed all the subsequent testing using the headphone output and other than SN ratio with the volume control set to –20dB to avoid clipping the outputFig20 Roksan Attessa phono input response with RIAA correction  I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the Roksans rear panel to obtain the lowest noise with the phono input The wideband unweighted SN ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a very good 71dB in both channels ref 1kHz at 5mV Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 76dB while an Aweighting filter further increased the ratio to 826dB Spectral analysis of the phono inputs lowfrequency noisefloor  revealed very low levels of random noise and power supply–related spuriaeFig21 Roksan Attessa MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz for 5mV input measured at headphone output with volume control set to the maximum The phono inputs overload margins measured at the headphone output and ref 1kHz at 5mV were superbly high at 20Hz and 1kHz at 235dB The margin dropped to a stillgood 105dB at 20kHz The phono inputs distortion signature was an equal mix of second and third harmonics both lying at –106dB  with 1kHz at an input level of 20mV  The level of the 1kHz difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones  was very low at close to –80dB  with the highorder intermodulation products even lower in levelFig22 Roksan Attessa MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz for 20mV input measured at headphone output with volume control set to –20dB Fig23 Roksan Attessa MM phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz witht 100mV input With separates it is possible for the designers to maximize resolution and minimize noise With a singlebox solution like the Roksan Attessa it is difficult to do these things with the currentheavy power supply in such close proximity to the lowlevel analog and digital decoding stages However the Attessas measured performance especially that of the lownoise lowdistortion phono input indicates that the inevitable compromises have been managed well
