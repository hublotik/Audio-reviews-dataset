0,One mbl Reference 9007 amplifier  was preconditioned in balanced monoblock mode by running it at onethird the specified clipping power into 8 ohms for one hour At the end of that period the heatsinks were just too hot to keep my hand on implying a temperature of around 60°C the chassis was much cooler The initial THDnoise figure at this power level was 0016 after 60 minutes this had dropped very slightly to 0013The 9007s voltage gain into 8 ohms was 27dB in both balanced  and singleended  modes and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting in both modes Both balanced and unbalanced input impedances were to specification at all audio frequencies at 20k ohms and 10k ohms respectively The output impedance for mono operation was a little on the high side for a solidstate design at 033 ohm at low and middle frequencies 038 ohm at 20kHz This is to be expected for a balanced design in which the output impedances of the two amplifier halves are effectively in series The 9007s output impedance in singleended stereo mode was exactly half this figure as anticipatedWith this highish output impedance the mbl 9007s frequency response into our standard simulated speaker load  featured some ±03dB of variation This was halved when the amplifier was used in stereo mode  The 9007s smallsignal bandwidth can be seen from this graph to be very wide with a –3dB point at 200kHz into 8 ohms The bandwidth decreased a little into lower impedances with a very slight degree of topoctave rolloff into 2 ohms The singleended bandwidth  was even wider with the output into 8 ohms down by just 165dB at 200kHz As a result of this wide bandwidth the 9007s reproduction of 1kHz and 10kHz squarewaves  was superb with no hint of overshoot or ringingFig1 mbl 9007 balanced frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 4 2 ohms Fig2 mbl 9007 smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 mbl 9007 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsUsed as a stereo amplifier the 9007 met its specified output power with the clipping points  of 137W into 8 ohms  231W into 4 ohms  and 396W into 2 ohms  As can be seen in fig4 the distortion was very low in level before clipping especially into 8 ohms The upward slope of the traces with decreasing power below 10–20W in this graph is due to the fact that the actual distortion is below the noise floor in this region Fig5 plots the THDN percentage against output power for balanced mono operation The clipping power has increased significantly to 444W into 8 ohms  600W into 4 ohms  but 515W into 2 ohms  The distortion also starts to rise at lower powers than with singleended operation however even in the worst case into 2 ohms it remains below 01 below 150WFig4 mbl 9007 singleended distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsFig5 mbl 9007 balanced distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsAs MF noted the 9007 is a very quiet amplifier its wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms in balanced mode was 909dB increasing to 1006dB when Aweighted In conjunction with the very high power this low noise floor endows the mbl with a greater dynamic range than almost any other amplifier that has passed through my test lab In fig6 I plotted how the balanced THDN percentage varies with frequency at 5V output which is where the actual distortion starts to rise out of the noise floor Though the distortion rises with decreasing load impedance it is very low in level and doesnt change with frequency which suggests that the 9007s circuit has a very wide openloop bandwidthFig6 mbl 9007 balanced THDN vs frequency at 5V into  8 4 2 ohmsIn addition to the low level of the distortion its content is predominantly the subjectively benign third harmonic  Note the low levels of evenorder harmonics in fig8 which suggest that the characteristics of the two amplifiers comprising the balanced 9007 are closely matched This graph was taken into 8 ohms into 4 ohms  the third harmonic rises only slightly by 4dB to –70dB —but the second harmonic rises from –90dB  to –80dB  No powersupply–related spuriae appear in any of these highpower spectra however suggesting that the 9007s power supply is up to the demands made of it Finally even just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen the 9007 produced low levels of intermodulation distortion Fig7 mbl 9007 balanced 1kHz waveform at 28W into 4 ohms  00175 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 mbl 9007 balanced spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 250W into 8 ohms Fig9 mbl 9007 balanced HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 420W peak into 4 ohms I love measuring an amplifier that is as wellengineered as the mbl 9007 But there is nothing in its measured performance other than the much higher output power that would indicate why Michael Fremer preferred its sound in balanced mono mode
