0, Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression M550 monoblock    I repeated some of the measurements with the magazines Audio Precision APx500 analyzer Usefully the box included a set of tests performed with the APx500Before I performed the testing  amplifier by running it at oneeighth its specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes as recommended by the Consumer Electronics Association After the preconditioning the M550s top panel was surprisingly cool at 968°F  The temperature of the massive heatsinks on the amplifiers sides was 1018°F  and didnt increase significantly with the amplifier idlingThe voltage gain into 8 ohms for the balanced input was 297dB and the input inverted absolute polarity the opposite of what I had found with earlier DAgostino amplifiers  The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was very slightly lower than the specified 100k ohms at 95k ohms dropping inconsequentially to 50k ohms at 20kHz The output impedance was higher than the specified 01 ohm at 037 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 04 ohm at 20kHz The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker therefore varied by ±026dB  The amplifier offered a wide smallsignal bandwidth the output into 8 ohms  not reaching –3dB until 140kHz The Progression M550s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  accordingly featured very short risetimes with commendably no apparent overshoot or ringing Fig1 Dan DAgostino Progression M550 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Dan DAgostino Progression M550 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsMeasured with both phases of the balanced input shorted to ground the M550s wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio was 553dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to 805dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 89dB when the reading was Aweighted The blue trace in fig3 taken at 1W into 8 ohms reveals that the primary source of noise is magnetic interference at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics which I assume stem from the massive toroidal transformer However at high powers  the spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics increase in levelFig3 Dan DAgostino Progression M550 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W  and at 100W  into 8 ohms When I examined how the percentage of THDN varied with output power with clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the amplifiers output reached 1 the M550 clipped at 555W into 8 ohms  which is marginally higher than the specified 550W  The clipping power into 4 ohms  was 840W  though this is 117dB lower than the specified 11kW I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests feeling that this is more representative of an amplifiers behavior in a typical system The wall voltage was 1187V with the amplifier idling but had dropped to 1151V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms Note from these two graphs that the distortion percentage at low powers is higher than it is at high powers This behavior was consistent with both Audio Precision analyzers and is almost identical to what I found with the Dan DAgostino Progression Mono amplifier that JVS reviewed in October 2017Fig4 Dan DAgostino Progression M550 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Dan DAgostino Progression M550 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsAs with the earlier amplifier I examined how the THDN percentage varied with frequency at a high level 283V which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms 200W into 4 ohms and 400W into 2 ohms  The results are shown in fig6 The distortion and noise remain low over most of the audioband into the higher impedances with only a minuscule rise in the top octave  However when waveform of the THDN at 100W into 8 ohms after notching out the fundamental  I saw spikes in the residual waveform  that coincided with the zerocrossing points in the signals waveform  This behavior indicates the presence of crossover distortionFig6 Dan

fundamental notched out Fig8 shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 100W into 8 ohms The subjectively innocuous second harmonic lies at –74dB  but a regular series of highorder harmonics can be seen which correlates with the waveform of the spuriae shown in fig7 The harmonic spectrum was very similar with the amplifier driving 50Hz into 4 ohms and 1kHz into 8 ohms at 283V  At 1W into 8 ohms the second harmonic was still the highest in level but lay at –60dB  and was still accompanied by higherorder harmonics Fig9 shows the spectrum of the M550s output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 100W While the difference product at 1kHz lay at an okay –73dB  there are also many higherorder intermodulation products visible

into 8 ohms The Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression M550 is a powerful amplifier indeed and will not be fazed by being required to drive lowimpedance loudspeakers However the presence of what appeared to be crossover distortion which suggests insufficient outputstage bias is puzzling Footnote 1 In measuring the Momentum HD preamplifier I found it inverted polarity but in a Manufacturers Comment Dan DAgostino wrote that this was due to an error in the preproduction firmware code that was fixed in all production units
