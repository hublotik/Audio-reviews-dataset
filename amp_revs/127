0, one Pass Labs XA608  for an hour at onethird its specified maximum power of 60W into 8 ohms—thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage By the end of the hour the top panel was warm at 964°F  and the sidemounted heatsinks were a little hotter at 1091°F   The XA608 ran a little cooler than the XA605 I reviewed in January 2014 probably due to its larger heatsinks    The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 253dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs  meaning that the XA608 will output 1W into 8 ohms with a drive signal of 155mV The amplifier was noninverting  with both inputs Its input impedance was usefully higher than that of the XA605 at 49k ohms unbalanced and 100k ohms balanced at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to 38k ohms at 20kHz for unbalanced signals The XA608s output impedance including 6 of speaker cable was 007 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 01 ohm at 20kHz The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±01dB  Into an 8 ohm resistive load  the XA605s response was flat up to 20kHz then rolled off to reach –3dB around 120kHz The response rolled off a little earlier into lower impedances but was still just 03dB down at 20kHz into 2 ohms  With this wide a smallsignal bandwidth the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured short risetimes and a wellsquared shape Fig1 Pass Labs XA608 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Pass Labs XA608 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground was an excellent 809dB This improved to 818dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband—and further still to 936dB when the measurement was Aweighted This is a quiet amplifier Fig3 indicates that both the odd and even harmonics of the 60Hz powersupply frequency were present though these all lay at or below –100dB ref 1W into 8 ohmsFig3 Pass Labs XA608 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Specified as putting out 60W into 8 ohms and 120W into 4 ohms  the XA608 considerably exceeded that power delivering at 1 total harmonic distortion  150W into 8 ohms  240W into 4 ohms  and 380W into 2 ohms  The THD begins to rise above the noise floor at high powers but remains at or below 01 below the specified output power The percentage of THD then slowly rises with increasing power suggesting that the XA608 has only a small amount of corrective feedbackFig4 Pass Labs XA608 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Pass Labs XA608 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Pass Labs XA608 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency at 9V a level where I could be sure from the earlier measurements that I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise The THDN was extremely low in the midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  and only just above 01 into 2 ohms  It rose linearly as the frequency increased the three traces converging in the high treble—which suggests that the circuit has limited openloop bandwidthFig7 Pass Labs XA608 THDN  vs frequency at 9V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fortunately the XA608s distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous loworder variety Fig8 shows the waveform of the THD spuriae at twothirds the specified power it suggests that the third harmonic is predominant though at low frequencies at this power  the second harmonic is highest in level at –72dB  With a 1kHz signal the second harmonic remains at this level but the third has risen to –63dB  Some higherorder harmonics can also be seen in fig10 but all are much lower in level than the second and third harmonicsFig8 Pass Labs XA608 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms 0072 THDN

into 8 ohms As with the XA605 the XA608s topoctave decrease in linearity seen in fig7 was associated with some higherorder intermodulation products that were fairly high in level when the XA608 was asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen  However the subjectively more objectionable secondorder product at 1kHz is almost 20dB lower at –78dB  At lower powers the intermodulation products were all much lower in level Fig11 Pass Labs XA608 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 40W peak into 8 ohms Fig12 Pass Labs XA608 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 2W peak into 4 ohms The measured performance of the Pass Labs XA608 is very similar to that of the XA605 Both are wellengineered amplifiers that deliver more usable power than their modest specifications suggest
