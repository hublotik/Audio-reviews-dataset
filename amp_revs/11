0,Because the CH Precision M11 is so heavy  I drove the 45 miles to Michael Fremers home   cables noninductive power resistors and analog and digital oscilloscopes and I set up everything on a table in his garage Because I knew from experience that the AC outlets in the garage are on a circuit with a 15A breaker I ran two long extension cables—one for the test gear one for the amplifier which has two AC cords—to an outlet in the house that has a 20A circuit with one of the two amplifiers configured as Michael had done for his auditioning Monaural mode 0dB gain adjust 20 global negative feedback and driven via the balanced input I repeated some of the tests with the highimpedance unbalanced input and with 0 and 100 negative feedback   I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone for an hour at onethird power into 8 ohms which is the most thermally stressful condition for an amplifier with a classAB output stage Because of time constraints however  M11 for 15 minutes At the end of that time the top panel was slightly warm at 824°F  aiming my infrared thermometer through the slots in the top panel at the heatsinks the temperature was 1015°F  I continued to monitor temperature but the amplifier didnt get any warmer throughout the testingThe voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 235dB for the balanced input but unusually 6dB higher from the unbalanced input Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  the XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot The balanced input impedance was a usefully high 90k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping inconsequentially to 58k ohms at 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance was 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 21k ohms at 20kHzThe output impedance with 100 feedback including a 6long spacedpair speaker cable was a low 01 ohms across the audioband With 20 feedback it rose to 024 ohm at low and middle frequencies and 027 ohm at the top of the audioband But when I started to measure the CH amplifiers smallsignal frequency response I realized that I had left my standard simulated loudspeaker at home However this output impedance should result in the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response with this load by close to ±025dB The M11s frequency response into 8 ohms  was flat to 20kHz and down by just 05dB at 60kHz a 10kHz squarewave was therefore reproduced with very short risetimes  A 1kHz squarewave was perfectly square  Though the ultrasonic output rolls off a little earlier into lower impedances the response into 2 ohms  was down by just 03dB at 20kHzFig1 CH Precision M11 frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 CH Precision M11 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the unbalanced input shorted to ground and ref 1W into 8 ohms was 764dB improving to 836dB with the measurement bandwidth restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 893dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor  indicated that there were AC powersupply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics these presumably due to magnetic interference from the huge power transformer Other than the spectral components at 60Hz and 180Hz which were at a stilllow –93dB and –97dB these spuriae all lay close to –110dB  and the random noisefloor components were all extremely low in levelFig3 CH Precision M11 spectrum DC–1kHz ref 1W into 8 ohms When I started testing the amplifiers output power I fed the balanced input at 1kHz tone at 188mV which resulted in exactly 1W into 8 ohms the M11s meter read 23W4 In its mono mode the CH M11s maximum output is specified as 200W into 8 ohms  350W into 4 ohms  and 600W into 2 ohms  With clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1 and with the M11 set to 20 feedback I measured a clipping power of 260W into 8 ohms  Increasing the feedback to 100 gave the same clipping power  but the distortion is very much lower at all powers below 200W into 8 ohms Into 4 ohms I measured 440W  and into 2 ohms 700W  I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests it dropped from 1225V AC with the amplifier idling to 1185V AC at the measured clipping power into 2 ohms The shortfall in maximum output power will not be an issue with typical loudspeakers and rooms but it did puzzle meFig4 CH Precision M11 20 NFB distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 CH Precision M11 100 NFB distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 CH Precision M11 20 NFB distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 CH Precision M11 20 NFB distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThe traces in Figs 4–7 suggested I examine how the M11s percentage of THDN varied with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms With 100 feedback  the percentage of THDN was extremely low into 8 ohms and 4 ohms in the bass and midrange with the rise in the treble due to the decrease in openloop voltage gain as the frequency increases However into 2 ohms  the amplifiers distortion was 10 times higher in the midrange than it was into 8 ohms and even higher at low frequencies Repeating the test with 20 feedback which is how Michael did all his auditioning the THDN was higher into 4 and 8 ohms  but similar to the 100 feedback behavior into 2 ohms  Even so it still lay below 01 below 10kHzFig8 CH Precision M11 100 NFB THDN  vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms Fig9 CH Precision M11 20 NFB THDN  vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The THDN waveform with 20 feedback at 100Wpc into 8 ohms  indicates that while the distortion was low at 0018 there were higherorder components present With a lowfrequency tone at 100Wpc into 8 ohms  the second and third harmonics were the highest in level at –93dB  and –87dB  respectively with many higherorder harmonics visible Repeating the analysis with 100 feedback  kept the third harmonic at the same level but the second harmonic dropped by 10dB and the higherorder products almost disappearedFig10 CH Precision M11 20 NFB 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms 0018 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig11 CH Precision M11 20 NFB spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Fig12 CH Precision M11 100 NFB spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms The reduced linearity of the M11s circuit at high frequencies meant that when tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones the amplifier produced relatively high levels of intermodulation distortion even at moderate powers  The difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB  with many higherorder products present This graph was taken with 20 feedback increasing the feedback to 100 gave a much cleaner spectrum Fig13 CH Precision M11 20 NFB HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms Fig14 CH Precision M11 100 NFB HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms The CH Precision M11 is a powerful amplifier but its measured performance is heavily dependent on the amount of global negative feedback selected A measurement freak such as I would choose 100 feedback but I note that Michael found 20 feedback to be the sweet spot when it came to the M11s sound quality And note that no matter the percentage of feedback this amplifier is more comfortable driving impedances higher than 2 ohms Footnote 1 The CH Precision M11 features the same adjustable global negative feedback as the companys I1 integrated amplifier which Jason Victor Serinus reviewed in February 2019 You can read my measurements of this amplifier hereFootnote 2 CH Precision says the meter on the M11 shows peak power not RMS power the rest of the discrepancy they attribute to a measuring technique that avoids adding components in series with the output signal
