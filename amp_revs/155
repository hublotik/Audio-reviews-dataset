0, TA PA 3100 HV   The review sample did not have the Tone ControlRoom Correction module fitted and neither did it have the optional PS 3000 HV auxiliary power supply I looked first at its behavior via its line inputs mostly with the volume control set to its maximum of 99 and then at lower settings  The frontpanel meters are correctly calibrated a power of 1W into 8 ohms being shown as 1W  amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the heatsinks were very hot at 1316°F  and the top panels temperature was 1036°F The maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 406dB for the balanced inputs 456dB for the singleended inputs At the headphone outputs the maximum gain measured 207dB and 257dB respectively The maximum gain at the preamplifier output was 1445dB for the balanced inputs to the balanced output and 134dB for the unbalanced inputs to the unbalanced output The PA 3100 HV preserved absolute polarity  at all of its outputsThe PA 3100 HVs unbalanced line input impedance is specified at 20k ohms which was confirmed by my measurements The balanced input impedance was 41k ohms The preamplifier output impedance was 44 ohms across the band for the unbalanced output 89 ohms for the balanced output The headphone output impedance was a moderately high 47 ohms across the audioband—50 ohms is specified—meaning that lowimpedance headphones will not be driven optimally by the TA amplifierThe amplifiers output impedance was 015 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 017 ohms at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was minimal  The smallsignal bandwidth into resistive loads with the volume control set to its maximum was flat to 20kHz and there was no overshoot or ringing with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  Channel matching was excellent and maintained at lower settings of the volume control The response at the headphone jack and the balanced preamplifier output was flat in the audioband and –25dB at 200kHz At the singleended preamplifier output the response was down by 15dB at 100kHzFig1 TA PA3100 HV frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig02 TA PA3100 HV smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation via the line inputs  was excellent at 90dB in both directions below 2kHz and still 80dB at the top of the audioband The wideband unweighted SN ratio taken with the unbalanced input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was a good 69dB  ref 283V output into 8 ohms Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 78dB while switching an Aweighting filter into the circuit further improved the ratio to 811dB The level of the PA 3100 HVs noise floor depended on the volume control setting With the control set to its maximum  lowlevel supplyrelated spuriae at 60Hz and its odd and even harmonics were visible in the amplifiers lowfrequency output spectrum  these were lowered by 10–15dB when the control was set to –20dB  Fig3 TA PA3100 HV spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to 79  and 99 TA specifies the PA 3100 HVs maximum continuous power as 300W into 8 ohms  and 500W into 4 ohms  With both channels driven and using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 fig4 indicates that the amplifier clipped at 318Wpc into 8 ohms  The TA amplifier also exceeded its specified power into 4 ohms clipping at 525Wpc  again with both channels driven  Fig4 TA PA3100 HV distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 TA PA3100 HV distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI measured how the PA 3100 HVs distortion changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN percentage was very low into both 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  It did rise above 01 into 2 ohms  but there was no rise in THDN in the top octaves which implies a commendably wide openloop bandwidth The distortion was predominantly the second harmonic  with the higher harmonics decreasing in a linear manner with frequency  Despite the good highfrequency linearity seen in fig6 there was a greater amount of intermodulation distortion with an equal highpower mix of 19kHz and 20Hz tones than I was anticipating  However the highestlevel intermodulation products still lay at or below –70dB Fig6 TA PA3100 HV THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms Fig7 TA PA3100 HV 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0044

at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms Overall the TA PA 3100 HV performed very well on the test bench It exceeded its specified power and while distortion is not especially low it is commendably consistent with frequency and consists primarily of the subjectively innocuous second harmonic with higherorder harmonics declining with increasing frequency
