0, IOM NCore Pro Hypex NC252MP classd based stereo power amplifier It was kindly purchased by  drop shipped to me It costs â‚¬669 from the company websiteThe IOM Ncore Pro comes in very compact and solid enclosureThe onoff button feels very good but I find the fonts very cheesy That same theme continues in the backI could not even read those fonts on the gain toggle switch until I took the above picture Great to see XLR balanced inputs in addition to RCA Note the unusual horizontal placement of the left and right speaker terminals I am used to them being stacked vertically when they are so close to each otherIn use the top of the amp barely increased in temperature The bottom was a bit more warm but nothing remotely of any concern There were no shutdowns However I did not try to stress load itAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt into 4 ohm test I chose the XLR input and low  gain for all of these testsThe SINAD  of 94 dB places the OMI Ncore Pro in the upper tier of amplifiersAVRs testedWhich was a relief after testing a number of home theater amplifiers that stacked on the right of the graphFrequency response is dead flat but not super wideSignal to noise ratio at max power output before clipping into 4 ohm was quite respectableHere is the intermodulation distortion at very high frequencies You have well over 16 bits of distortion free at modest listening levels Keep in mind that your music never has such high amplitudes at these frequencies So in practice the distortion will vanish into noiseCrosstalk performance was excellentThe meat of any amplifier review is power versus distortion and noise Here it is at 4 ohmShame to see the early rise in distortion starting at 20 watts That aside you have considerable amount of power clocking at 236 watts both channels driven in this tiny enclosureSwitching to 8 ohm load we getNow the early rise in distortion is more modest We get 125 watts of power at a SINAD of 91 db Interesting to compare it to Purifi 1E400A which produces similar power but a whopping 130 dB SINAD or 40 dB betterPeak power is sadly not much more than steady state due likely to regulated power suppliesGood thing the baseline level of power is quite goodConclusionsThe IOM NCore Pro amp is a solid performer courtesy of competent hypex NC252MP class D amplifier modules The packaging is nice and tidy and the price seems reasonable to meNo you are not getting state of the art performance That is in another category altogether But that level of performance will cost you more money and comes in a larger packageOverall I am happy to recommend the IOM NCore Pro amplifier
