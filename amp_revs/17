0,I measured NADs Masters Series M33   Usually before I test an amplifier I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour This thermally stresses an amplifier with a conventional classAB output stage but as the NAD is a classD design this wasnt necessary However before doing any testing I ran the M33 for an hour to ensure that it was fully warmed up At the end of that time the top panel was slightly warm at 1007°F382°C Because classD amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slewrate limiting all measurements other than the frequency response and squarewave tests were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates the ultrasonic noiseLooking first at the analog inputs With the NADs volume control set to its maximum of 00dB the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 333dB at the speaker terminals with both balanced and unbalanced inputs The maximum gain at the headphone output was 94dB and at the preamplifier output was 53dB The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  at all three sets of outputs The singleended input impedance was a usefully high 50k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly to 36k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedances were twice these values as expected except at 20kHz where it was 92k ohms The headphone output impedance was a very low 28 ohms rather than the specified 22 ohms At the preamplifier outputs the impedance was an appropriately low 100 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz rising slightly but inconsequentially to 124 ohms at 20HzThe M33s output impedance at the speaker terminals was a low 008 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 01 ohm at 20kHz  Fig1 shows the frequency response at the speaker outputs with the M33s AD converter set to its maximum sample rate of 192kHz Unlike the M32 where a peak developed at the top of the audioband especially into higher load impedances  the M33s audioband output is flat and rolls off above 20kHz reaching –3dB at 55kHz However note the imbalance between the channels with the left channel  06dB higher in level than the right   With the amplifiers very low output impedance the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  varies by just ±005dB Measured at the preamplifier and headphone outputs with the AD converter set to 96kHz the response extends to just above 40kHz but a slight amount of passband ripple can be seen Fig1 NAD M33 analog input volume control at 00dB sample rate set at 192kHz frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 NAD M33 analog input sample rate set at 96kHz frequency response at preamplifier output at 1V into 100k ohms  Fig3 shows the effect of the M33s bass and treble controls set to their maximum and minimum positions and with the converter sample rate set to 96kHz Both controls offer a sensible range of ±6dB as specified With the tone controls bypassed and without the external Audio Precision lowpass filter the M33s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured a slight critically damped overshoot Fig3 NAD M33 analog input sample rate set at 96kHz tone control response at 1V into 8 ohms with Bass and Treble controls set to 0 6 and –6  Channel separation was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz decreasing to 72dB at 20kHz Without the AP lowpass filter and with no signal present about 220mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the speaker outputs With the filter the singleended analog inputs shorted to ground and with the volume control set to 00dB the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratios  were significantly better than those of the M32 at 758dB in the left channel and 738dB in the right Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratios to 854dB left and 783dB right and an Aweighting filter increased both to 915dB Levels of any residuals at the AC powerline frequency and its harmonics were negligible Fig4 NAD M33 analog input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig5 NAD M33 analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The M33 is specified as clipping at 210Wpc into 8 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive and both channels driven the M33 exceeded the specified 8 ohm power delivering 255Wpc  NAD doesnt specify the continuous clipping power into 4 ohms I measured 460Wpc into 4 ohms  This is an approximate figure as the amplifiers protection circuit operated intermittently at powers above 400WFig6 NAD M33 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 NAD M33 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe shape of the traces in figs6 and 7 reveals that any distortion lies below the noise levels at powers below a few tens of watts I therefore investigated how the THDnoise varied with frequency at a level of 20V equivalent to 50Wpc into 8 ohms and 100Wpc into 4 ohms Distortion levels were very low in both channels into 8 ohms  but into 4 ohms were higher in the right channel  than the left  The shape of the spuriae waveform at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  suggests that the distortion signature is primarily thirdharmonic in nature this harmonic was higher in the right channel  than the left  Intermodulation distortion at high powers was low even into 4 ohms Fig8 NAD M33 analog input THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig9 NAD M33 analog input 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms 00013 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental

Turning to the digital inputs a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in an output level of 962V into 8 ohms with the volume control set to 00dB which suggests that these inputs have too much gain A fullscale digital signal would result in an output voltage thats far beyond clipping  The levels at the preamplifier and headphone outputs at –20dBFS were 382mV and 6075mV indicating that a digital signal at 0dBFS will not clip these outputs To avoid damaging the M33s output stage with fullscale digital signals  behavior of the digital inputs at the headphone output which mutes the speaker outputs The AESEBU and coaxial and optical SPDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz The NADs impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the M33s response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression just above half the sample rate  An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  cant therefore be seen though the distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor the third harmonic being the highest in level at just –86dB Fig12 NAD M33 digital input impulse response Fig13 NAD M33 digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor on average dropped by almost 30dB though the floor with 24bit data was rather dirtylooking The M33 offers at least 20 bits of resolution therefore which is excellent for an integrated amplifiers digital section With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical With undithered 24bit data the result was a clean sinewave Fig14 NAD M33 digital input spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Fig15 NAD M33 digital input waveform of undithered 16bit 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS Fig16 NAD M33 digital input waveform of undithered 24bit 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS The NADs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit TosLink data  was superb with all the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave at the correct levels  With 24bit JTest data  no jitterrelated sidebands were present The M33 replaces the M32s USB input with an Ethernet port Repeating the jitter testing with data sourced over my network with Roon revealed no differences from the measured performance with SPDIF and AESEBU dataFig17 NAD M33 digital input highresolution

range ±35kHzI set the M33s AD converter to a sample rate of 192kHz for the phono input measurements  behavior of the phono input at the headphone output as in MC mode with the inputs level adjust set to 00dB the possibility existed of driving the loudspeaker outputs into clipping The maximum gain in MC mode was a very high 906dB at the speaker outputs 623dB at the preamplifier outputs and 664dB at the headphone outputs In MM mode the maximum gains were 686dB  4034dB  and 444dB  The MM gains are all appropriate for typical movingmagnet phono cartridges but the MC gain is a little on the high sideBoth MM and MC modes preserve absolute polarity In MM mode the input impedance was slightly low at 26k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 235k ohms at 20kHz In MC mode the input impedance was an appropriately low 127 ohms across the audioband The RIAA error was both very low and wellmatched between channels  and channel separation was excellent at 80dB in both directions from 20Hz to 20kHz In MM mode the phono inputs wideband unweighted SN ratio ref 1kHz at 5mV was excellent at 6975dB this improving to 802dB when Aweighted In MC mode the unweighted SN ratios were about 9dB lower than in MM mode but a still good 611dB when AweightedFig19 NAD M33 phono input response with RIAA correction The phono inputs overload margins were also excellent at 18dB across the audioband in MM mode and 164dB in MC mode In every case the 1 THDnoise figure was equivalent to the headphone output clipping at just over 6V into 100k ohms Both harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion were extremely low via the phono input In MM mode with a 1kHz signal at 20mV ie 12dB higher than the nominal 5mV level the third harmonic was the highest in level but still it lay at just –100dB Like its predecessor NADs M33 packs a lot of wellengineered performance into its relatively small chassis It improves on the M32s performance in several areas Footnote 1 See fig1 hereFootnote 2 NAD specifies clipping power at a more conservative 01 THD
