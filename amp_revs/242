0, Lexicon first generation DD8 8channel amplifier It was purchased used by  drop shipped to me The DD8 came from collaboration of Harman with TI  to produce very low weight switching amplifiers for BMW car audio system It was then later repurposed in this configuration for the Custom Integration  industry It is actually rebranded by a number of companies and sold under their label Note our company Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman products which includes Lexicon So keep potential bias in mind as you read this reviewAll 8 channels are provided in one compact very cool running 1U rack mount chassisA stout on off switch manages power duties together with heftiest relay sound you have heard The back will seem unusual for hifi market but is precisely what the custom integration channel needsYou can either feed the unit individually per channel or a bus input that feeds the same stereo input to all the channels The latter is very handy for whole house audio where the same music plays in every room from ceiling speakers and such A looped bus output is provided to cascade more of these unitsOutput is provided through phoenix connectors which again is common and desired in CI channel as they are secure but small connectors Individual gain controls are provided for every channel You can also select mono vs stereo  And autosensing for channels not used Trigger is also provided of courseThe available units are pulled out of existing installs so likely have many hours on them And if the installer didnt know what he was doing it may have been subjected to high temps Indeed the first unit the owner bought did not work right changing its gain with temperature I traced it to the frontend of the unit So know what you are getting if you buy them usedBrand new second generation DD8s cost US 3500  This version listed for US 2500 I see them listed for 1300 right now on ebay but I believe the owner was able to get it much cheaperLexicon DD8 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard I set the gain to max which nicely gave me 29 dB which is what I have standardized onThis is above average performance with distortion kept below 100 dBNoise performance is good as wellIdeally we would get 16 bits at 5 watts but 15 is a good effortI was disappointed by the early cut off from the output filterThis is due to rather low switching frequency of 250 kHz  which made the filter harder to designCrosstalk is finePower into 4 ohm is rather lowThe protection circuit was aggressive which made getting max and peak power difficult Still I managed to get some numbersWhile we get more burst power courtesy of power supply designed for a lot more channels than two max power with 1 THDN still was rather lowI then tested the amp using 8 ohm and surprisingly it produces more power thereTo see how the power scales I measured max power using two and four channels Both were the same using 8 ohmMost disappointing was varying the frequency and producing a power sweepAs you see there is huge penalty at higher frequencies Furthermore there are power related linearitiesConclusionsIn mid to low frequencies the DD8 produces well above average performance Above that frequency though distortion increases substantially and other nonlinearities surface Output seems to have some load dependency while also rolling off earlyIf you can get the unit for a few hundred dollars then its compact enclosure and general performance may be a steal You could almost push me to recommend it but I am not going to I like to see better performance with respect to frequency response and high frequencies  I think for its intended custom install market it is perfect  For hifi use you have to make that decision
