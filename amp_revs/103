0, Pathos InPoL Remix MkII with my  checking some of the results with the magazines APx500 systemThe review sample was not fitted with the optional HiDac Mk2 digitalinput board Although the Remix MkIIs output stages are described as operating in classA where the maximum heat dissipation is with no signal I still preconditioned the Pathos amplifier before the testing by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the heatsinks were hot at 1181°F  as was the top panel at 1136°F  This amplifier needs to be wellventilatedThe Pathoss volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps and the maximum voltage gain from the loudspeaker outputs into 8 ohms was 362dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs The maximum gain at the balanced Pre outputs was 17dB at the singleended Pre outputs it was 101dB and from the headphone output it was 8dB The Remix MkII preserved absolute polarity  at all the outputs with both input types The input impedance is specified as 47k ohmsI measured a usefully higher 92k ohms for the unbalanced input at low and middle frequencies dropping to a stillhigh 505k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was 176k ohms at 20Hz 180k ohms at 1kHz and 137k ohms at 20kHz The Pathos wont load down source componentsThe Pathoss linelevel source impedances were 929 ohms from the balanced Pre output 465 ohms from the unbalanced Pre output and a usefully low 1 ohm from the headphone output these values consistent across the audioband The loudspeaker output impedance was a relatively high 08 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing slightly to 084 ohm at 20kHz  The modlation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore ±07dB  which may well be audible The response into resistive loads was flat in the audioband but rolled off above 20kHz The response into 8 ohms  was down by 1dB at 80kHz that into 2 ohms  was –1dB at 55kHzFig1 Pathos InPol Remix MkII frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Note the 025dB channel imbalance in favor of the right channel in this graph which was taken with the volume control set to its maximum the imbalance was identical when I repeated the response measurement with the control set to –20dB The frequency response at the headphone output was down by just 1dB at 200kHz As expected from the Remix MkIIs wide smallsignal bandwidth its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave from the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms  was superb with no overshoot or ringingFig2 Pathos InPol Remix MkII smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was very good at 95dB below 2kHz and still 73dB at the top of the audioband Measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the amplifiers unweighted wideband signal noise ratio was a disappointing 522dB ref 1W into 8 ohms  improving to 719dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz– 22kHz Switching an Aweighting filter into circuit further improved the ratio to 756dB Spectral analysis of the Remix MkIIs lowfrequency noisefloor with the volume control set to its maximum  revealed a relatively high level of random noise with lowlevel spuriae visible at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its oddorder harmonics Repeating the analysis with the volume control set to –20dB  reduced the levels of both the random noise and the 60Hzrelated spuriae by the same 20dB This suggests that the noise occurs in the circuit ahead of the volume control perhaps in the input tubesFig3 Pathos InPol Remix MkII spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at maximum  and at –20dB  The Pathos InPoL Remix MkII is specified to deliver up to 25Wpc into 8 ohms  and 38Wpc into 4 ohms  the former at 01 THD With our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 and with both channels driven the Remix MkII clipped with a 1kHz signal at 20W into 8 ohms  and at 8W into 4 ohms  Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3 THDN gave powers of 30W into 8 ohms  and 12W into 4 ohms  The amplifier met its specified maximum power into 4 ohms at 65 THDNFig4 Pathos InPol Remix MkII distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Pathos InPol Remix MkII distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe shape of the traces in figs4 and 5 suggests that the actual distortion starts to rise above the noisefloor at a few hundred milliwatts and increases steadily as the power rises This implies that little or no loop negative feedback is present I examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency at 53V which is equivalent to 35W into 8 ohms and 7W into 4 ohms The THDN was close to 01 into 8 ohms  but was 10 times higher into 4 ohms  The THDN percentage was a little higher in the right channel into both loadsFig6 Pathos InPol Remix MkII THDN  vs frequency at 53V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The left channels distortion with 1kHz into 8 ohms was predominantly the third harmonic  but in the right channel  it was joined by the second harmonic at the same level –73dB or 002 At the same voltage 283V into 4 ohms  the third harmonic rose to –54dB  in both channels Intermodulation distortion with the amplifier driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1W into 8 ohms  was low in level Both the secondorder difference product at 1kHz and the higherorder intermodulation products lay at –80dB  A peculiar rise in the highfrequency noisefloor can be seen in the right channels spectrum Fig7 Pathos InPol Remix MkII 1kHz

Remix MkII spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 2Wpc into 4 ohms Fig10 Pathos InPol Remix MkII HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms The Pathos InPoL Remix MkIIs measured performance appears to be dominated by its use of a tubed input stage with little or no loop negative feedback  But the amplifiers inability to drive low impedances without what I feel to be excessive levels of harmonic distortion is a matter for concern Footnote 1 Although in an InPoL circuit transistors meet the demand for current—Jim Austin
