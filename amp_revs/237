0, Marantz PM90 Vintage stereo integrated amplifier It was purchased by a member from japan and drop shipped to me for testing It came out in 1991 with a price of 160000 Yen  I looked online and I can only find one for US 950 but it is more beat up than this unitI must say this is one nice looking amplifier with a look that would fit in even todayThe feel of the controls is excellent other than volume control which I found a bit loose A flip down door gives you additional control including switching between Class AB and Class A mode of operation Sadly it requires the unit to be powered down to change so no opportunity for instant switching and comparisonI was pleasantly surprised to see modern beefy speaker terminals as wellEven more interesting is the inclusion of XLR balanced inputs for CDThis amplifier is back breakingly heavy due to use of two massive transformers It is at the limit of what I could lift and carry up two flight of stairs for testing Sitting here my back aches just thinking about the reverse trip to pack the darn thing Speaking of packing it was immaculately double boxed by HifiDo with zero impact to it despite the long journey Apparently it even came with one year warranty although you have to ship it back to Japan for thatSpeaking of Japan the unit is made for that market and hence 100 volt rating as opposed to 120 volts we have here in US If it were mine I would go ahead and use it at 120 but being that of someone elses and hard to replace I powered it by both my Lab AC generator and a Variac set to 100 volts This may have caused some measurement issues as I noted belowMarantz PM90 Amplifier MeasurementsThere is a lot here to test due to dual mode of operation and dual type of input Lets start with Class A operation with RCA and then XLRUnfortunately our measurements are polluted by high mains noise and harmonics I tried every which way but could not reduce that impact much Whether this is due design of the amplifier or longer AC mains connection due to use of lab AC gen or Variac I cant tell As is SINAD doesnt appear to be better than modern AVRs with Marantz on their front plateHowever if we look at the FFT we see only two harmonics and then it disappears into noise Here is the performance of Marantz SR7015 as a referenceNoise from power supply is lower there which aids it in getting similar SINADSwitching to Class AB mode has no penaltyIf anything distortion harmonics go a bit lower although that was not reliableTo see if there is a difference at all between Class AB and Class A I turned on the residual mode of Audio Precision in the scope display This shows us the difference between input and output waveforms If there is zero crossing error due to class AB operation we should see more difference around that part of the waveform but we dontWhat is there is mostly power supply noise I changed frequencies power level down to 1 watt and still saw nothing that would correlate with zero crossing distortion which class A is supposed to solve Feedback and class AB operation seem to have cured that ailment leaving little room for Class A to do betterHere is the comparison between Class AB and Class A again with respect to signal to noise ratioClass AB pulls ahead in full power mode because it can create more power At baseline 5 watts they are similar likely limited by power supply noiseCrosstalk showed a tiny improvement in favor of class A but it is not materialBandwidth is good but not exceptionalNotice how amplifier gain changes as you switch modes so for any listening tests you may have to compensate for thatClass AB of course has tons more powerOverall shape of the graph is average Wanting to see the impact of the preamp vs power amp I separated the two and fed the unit with my analyzer direct using RCAAs expected my analyzer is cleaner but impact is on distortion not noise which is a bit surprising As is one channel being worse than the other  SINAD reaches almost 100 dB now near full power good channel which is very niceThere is a lot of headroom when using class AB vs Class ATesting amplifier linearity vs frequency we getClass A power limits more at 20 Hz than Class AB Both show very predictable and smooth responses which is greatMultitone tests shows slightly lower distortion at higher frequencies in favor of Class AEffectiveness of feedback lowers at higher frequencies and likely this is the reason class A does better thereMarantz PM90 Phono Input MeasurementsIt was hard to figure out a fair way to measure the performance of its phono stage to compare to standalone devices At first I used tape output but that didnt produce great response Best was from preamp tap to power ampSadly the mains noise is there and dwarfs SINAD There is no sign of harmonic distortion so that is very good Same situation exists for MC modeRIAA equalization is probably the best I have measuredThat story continues into headroom measurementsYou get almost 12 volts of output before it starts to clip So pops and clicks should be much less noticeableConclusionsThe PM90 does NOT show its age It produces above average performance compared to todays amplifiers It does so while running very cool and comfortable Not once did it get warm to touch or go into protection Push it hard and it just pulls back on the output but keeps going Clearly this is a very robust implementation Can it compete with state of the art amplification today in the form of Benchmark THX and HypexPurifi Class D amps No There is real innovation there to push down distortion and noise But we also have a lot of terrible amplifiers today which the PM90 easily outperforms and does it with so much styleThere is nothing to apologize for and a lot to praise for Marantz PM90 I hope the company goes back to these roots rather than horrible looks and performance of much of their AV lineOn class A mode I see no reason to recommend it and many reasons to avoid it If you run out of power there you will certainly create audible distortion Whereas any benefit it might have is literally lost in the noiseI am happy to recommend the Marantz PM90
