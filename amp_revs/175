0,I used my  system to examine the Octave Jubilee Mono SEs measured performance  I followed the instructions in the manual to check the bias of the eight output tubes after running the amplifier for 30 minutes to allow the operating conditions to stabilize The pots that allow the bias for each tube to be optimized have a somewhat coarse action The best I could arrange was for the bias for the tubes to lie between 1005 and 1025 as indicated by the digital meter on the amplifiers top panelThe Octave Jubilee Mono SE preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting with both the balanced and singleended inputs The voltage gain at 1kHz was 29dB into 8 ohms for both inputs this inconsequentially lower than the specified 30dB The balanced input impedance was a high 51k ohms at all audio frequencies The singleended input impedance was even higher at 74k ohms at 20Hz 71k ohms at 1kHz and 52k ohms at 20kHzOctave doesnt specify the output impedance of the Jubilee Mono SEs single output transformer tap I measured 2 ohms  at low and middle frequencies rising to 45 ohms at the top of the audioband The variation in the smallsignal frequency response of the Jubilee Mono into our standard simulated loudspeaker  was ±12dB which will be audible The amplifiers response into 16 ohms  gently rose above 10kHz before rolling off above 39kHz The increase in output impedance in the top octave meant that the response increasingly rolled off as the load impedance was reduced Into 2 ohms for example the output was down by 4dB at 20kHz  A slight peak at 70kHz can be seen in the response traces this correlated with a small amount of welldamped ringing in the Jubilee Monos reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms Fig1 Octave Jubilee Mono SE frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 Octave Jubilee Mono SE smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  was very good measuring 732dB This ratio improved to an excellent 905dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 967dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor with the Octave amplifier driving a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  revealed that ACrelated spuriae were very low in levelFig3 Octave Jubilee Mono SE spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Octave Jubilee Mono SEs maximum power is specified as 400W into 4 ohms  With our usual definition of clipping—when the THDnoise reaches 1—I measured a clipping power of 175W into 16 ohms  295W into 8 ohms  and 68W into 4 ohms  Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3 THDN the Jubilee Mono clipped at 380W into 4 ohms  just shy of its full rated power In the Jubilee Monos manual Octave says that the minimum recommended load impedance is 2 ohms maximum power into that load the amplifier reached 3 THDN at 88W  I also examined how the power delivery changed if I switched the amplifier into the lowbias mode which is indicated by the bias LED on the top panel turning from blue to green However the THDN was very much higher than the very low distortion at low powers that can be seen in figs5 and 6Fig4 Octave

1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 Octave Jubilee Mono SE distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsFig8 shows how the percentage of THDN varies with frequency into 16 8 4 and 2 ohms at 5V  Other than the usual rise in the top audio octave which will be due to the limited openloop bandwidth the THDN was impressively low into 16 ohms  However it rose with each halving of the load impedance and was close to 1 into 2 ohms Fig8 Octave Jubilee Mono SE THDN  vs frequency at 5V into 16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The Octaves distortion signature into 8 ohms predominantly comprised the second and third harmonics  I recently received an email from veteran English engineer Ben Duncan  in which he told me that he had found a correlation between the smoothness of an amplifiers THDN waveform and its sound quality The spikier the waveform the less its sound quality was preferred by listeners By that criterion even though the second and third harmonics in the Jubilee Mono SEs output each lie close to –60dB  the relative absence of higherorder harmonics should result in good sound quality Fig9 Octave Jubilee Mono SE 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms 0122 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Octave Jubilee Mono SE spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 10W into 8 ohms Duncans finding depends on an amplifiers harmonic distortion not being accompanied by excessive levels of intermodulation distortion The Jubilee Mono SE did okay when I looked at the spectrum of its output while it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10Wpc into 4 ohms  The 1kHz difference product lay 70dB below the peak signal level  while the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz lay at –60dB Fig11 Octave Jubilee Mono SE HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 10W peak into 4 ohms The Octave Jubilee Mono SE offers massive power albeit at relatively high levels of distortion most likely due to a design decision only to use a modest amount of loop negative feedback I commend the amplifier for its low levels of distortion at moderate powers into higher impedances coupled with its benign distortion signature and its low levels of noise I wouldnt recommend the Jubilee Monos use with loudspeakers whose impedance drops below 4 ohms however Footnote 1 Ben Duncan has contributed several technical articles to
