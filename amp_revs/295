0, Emotiva XPA HC1 Monoblock amplifier   costs US 879As the name indicates this is a single channel power amplifier I have a soft spot for monoblocks and the HC1 hits it I especially like the power button which has buttery action and nice orange color when you hit it Alas then it switches to the cold trademark blue color of Emotiva Wish they would switch to that orangeNote that the amplifier is very deep probably three times as deep as it is high Back panel shows nice inclusion of XLR input which is what I used for testingThe design of the amplifier is Class AB with dual power supply rails in order to keep power consumption low at lower powers It did that as the amplifier barely generated any heat during my testing I was not a fan of the protection circuit though as when it clicked in  it required power switch in the back to be toggled I like selfresetting protection circuits and if that is not possible have the front panel be used for that purposeIf you are not familiar with my amplifier measurements I highly suggest watching this video on amplifier measurementsEmotiva HC1 Amplifier MeasurementsLets start with our usual 5 watt dashboard using XLR inputMy eye quickly went to the high distortion products which sadly lands the HC1 at well below average of all amplifiers testedEven though SINAD is distortion dominated above noise performance at 5 watts is not anything to write home about eitherI like to see an amplifier above budget prices to clear 16 bit hurdle of 96 dB at 5 watts Or else sensitive speakers may spit out noiseFrequency response is essentially flat in audible band and good bandwidthMultitone test patter shines a familiar light on the amplifier when it comes to distortionIn an attempt to have more common measurements with other sites I decided to run the 1920 kHz intermodulation distortion Spray of intermodulation products around our dual tones dont paint a pretty pictureLets run our power sweepsWe do have a lot of power but alas that comes at the expensive of noisedistortion Allowing for 1 THD distortion we do get a lot of powerRail switching design  shows distinct change in performance as that happensNotice how distortion is lowest around our 1 kHz testing and increased when you go lower or higher in frequency The latter is kind of expected but not the lowerConclusionsThe Emotiva brand is one of budget prices but with high performance Alas after testing many of their products the right message here is budget prices with slightly below average performance Company really needs to retool their products and bring up the objective performance up a notch or two Then they will have a winning formula As is we see products like HC1 here which underperform more than half the amplifiers ever tested  Fortunately it is very powerful so likely sounds OKI cant recommend the Emotiva XPS HC1 amplifier It is an OK amp but we are not here for OK products As always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
