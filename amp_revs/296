0, Rega IO stereo integrated amplifier with phono input   costs US 649 on Amazon including Prime shipping It is designed and built in UK and price there seems much more reasonable The front panel doesnt do much for meIt is function though with a simple input switch and power The inclusion of remote control is a nice touchCourtesy of the company heritage in building turntables it has phono input builtin No digital inputs which is an odd omission in this day and ageRega IO Amplifier MeasurementsWith power amplifiers I let them run at about 5 watts into my 4 ohm load and watch their distortionnoise to see when it stabilizes It did not in the case of Regao IO and contrary to audiophile belief kept getting worseI watched every video review of this box while waiting but it would simply not stabilize At around 2300 minute I started to sense the smell of electronics running too hot so I put my hand on it That was a mistake as it darn near burned it The sides were quite hot I took an IR picture of itAs you see the left and right bars run much hotter with the back end being at around 45 degrees C This is in open air in cool weather where we live Imagine what it would do at higher power delivery and when put in a cabinet Not good Company provides lifetime warranty but says it wont include wear and tear Wonder if it cooks itself whether they repair it under warrantyAnyway lets get on with our testing starting with our dashboardA lot of things stand out For starters the channel gain is not matched The mismatch seemed to be volume pot independent Then there is the matter of very high levels of mains hum and harmonics No matter what I did with grounding it would not make any difference whatsoever  The mains noise is actually higher in energy than the harmonics That is not a bad thing in that our sensitivity at lower frequencies is much lower than at higher upsSINAD sums all the noise and distortion and lands the IO in the fair categoryThis is well below average of nearly 79 dBSignal to noise ratio as a result is nothing to write home aboutI was surprised that despite being a simple class AB design it doesnt have flat response in audible bandMost shocking measurement was that of crosstalkHere is our multitone test showing the impact of distortionCompany specs the amp at just 30 watts into 8 ohm and good news is that it delivers thatBut this is not much power Here is what we get into 4 ohmThankfully being a class AB amplifier with unregulated power supply it does better in burst modeModern speakers are built in compact enclosure that reduces their efficiency greatly I am not sure this is enough powerHere is our frequency stepped responseClass AB designs sport clean transfer functions and the Rega is no exception Typical of all amps though you lose power at very low frequencies Usually you have a lot to loosing some is not super painful Here though you dont so that is not good newsPhono Stage MeasurementsThere is no preamp output so I decided to use the headphone output to measure the RIAA equalizationGood showing here assuming you prefer less bass to LP rumbleHeadphone Output MeasurementsCompany specifies the headphone output as having an impedance of  100 ohm which is massive It will cause frequency response error in vast number of headphones which have variable impedance And on those flat ones which tend to be low it will dissipate a lot of power internallyThis is basically a checklist feature and not something that you want to use for any serious headphone listeningConclusionsI have a soft spot for western companies trying to compete with Asian ones in budget audio products Alas performance has to be there to do the job and for the most part it is not with Rega IO Capability is poor as far as power output Measurements like crosstalk are horrid Headphone output is years behind times with super high impedance And then we have the large amount of heat this generates If this were a powerful amplifier I could understand idling high but not when all you have is 30 watts into 8 ohm Amplifiers have a tough life and you want them to be reliable I am not sure how long the IO will last given the elevated temps under which it operatesI dont know that this is a terrible amplifier but when test after test makes me cringe I have no choice but to withhold recommendation for Rega IOEdit see teardown here always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
