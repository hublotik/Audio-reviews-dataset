0, Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE   The VK56SE looks identical to the VK55SE which Wes Phillips reviewed in April 2010 and it was instructive to compare its measured performance with that of the earlier amplifier Like the VK55SE the VK56SE has four output terminals for each channel various pairs of which can be used to provide a feed from three different outputtransformer taps labeled High Med and Low I performed a complete set of measurements from each tap but have concentrated on the Low outputs in this discussion as those were the taps preferred by Herb ReichertBoth the smallsignal and output tubes are delivered numbered and I installed them from left to right as instructed in the manual The amplifiers maximum voltage gain from the High output tap was the same as the VK55SEs and lower than the norm at 24dB into 8 ohms The gain from the Med tap was 232dB and 23dB from the Low tap Each output tap was noninverting  with pin 2 of the XLR jacks wired hot The input impedance was very high—a good thing—at 155k ohms across the audioband The output impedance from the VK56SEs High tap was both very high at 67 ohms from low to high frequencies and higher than that of the earlier amplifier As a result of the Ohms law interaction between the high output impedances and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker the amplifiers frequency response into this load varied by a very audible ±21dB from the High tap  The output impedance was lower from the Med and Low taps at 55 and 335 ohms respectively The response from the Low tap with our simulated loudspeaker varied by ±15dB  compared with ±12dB for the VK55SE Into resistive loads the VK56SE offered a flat response in the audioband with excellent channel matching and a wide smallsignal bandwidth The amplifiers ultrasonic response into 8 ohms didnt reach –3dB until 150kHz which correlates with a very square squarewave response  The waveforms risetimes are very short and there is neither overshoot nor ringingFig1 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE High output tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE Low output tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig3 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE High output tap smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was good but not as good as that of the earlier amplifier measuring 70dB in both directions below 3kHz and decreasing to 58dB at the top of the audioband The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio measured at the High output tap and taken with the input shorted was good at 792dB ref 1W into 8 ohms in the right channel It was worse in the left channel however measuring 675dB When Aweighted these ratios respectively improved to 962 and 833dB The ratios from the Low tap were 12dB worse The reason for the difference between the channels ratios can be seen in fig4 which shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output as it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms from the High tap Powersupply–related spuriae at 60 and 180Hz and especially 120Hz are up to 17dB higher in the left channel  than the right  I checked the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer but couldnt get any lower noise than is shown in this graphFig4 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE High output tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms  Like the VK55SE the VK56SE is specified as having a maximum output power of 55Wpc into 8 ohms  at 3 THDnoise The VK56SE delivered 60Wpc into 8 ohms from its High tap  59Wpc from the Med tap  and 54Wpc from the Low tap all at 3 THDN However the distortion at lower powers was higher than I like to see as can be seen in fig5 which plots the THDN percentage against output power into 8 ohms from the High tap The steady rise in THD with power before actual waveform clipping is reached suggests that this amplifier uses only a modest amount of loop negative feedback The 4 ohms delivery from the High output was similar  though the power at 1 THDN dropped from 53Wpc into 8 ohms to 31Wpc into 4 ohms The Med tap delivered slightly more power at 1 THDN into 4 ohms  and 54Wpc at 3 THDN  Fig8 plots the THDN percentage against output power from HRs preferred Low tap into 8 ohms and shows that the lowlevel distortion is lower than from the other two taps even into 4 ohms  However into 2 ohms from the Low tap  the distortion at low powers was the same as from the High tap into 8 ohmsFig5 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE High output tap THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE High output tap THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE Med output tap

tap THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig10 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE Low output tap THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThe VK55SEs two channels had differed in their smallsignal linearity which Id conjectured was due to our review samples tubes having had a lot of mileage on them However the VK56SE behaved similarly Fig11 plots the THDN percentage against frequency from the Low tap at 283V into 8 4 and 2 ohms Into the two higher impedances the right channel  offered lower distortion in the midrange and treble than the left  and into 2 ohms the left channels THDN remained above 1  However both channels offered higher levels of distortion as the frequency dropped this presumably due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformers and this behavior was more extreme from the High tap Fig11 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE Low output tap THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig12 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE High output tap THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Such high levels of distortion wont necessarily result in poor sound quality if the harmonics present are loworder This would appear to be case from the waveform of the distortion content  taken at 1W into 8 ohms from the High output which appears to be predominantly secondharmonic in nature This is confirmed by the spectrum of the VK56SEs output at the same power from the Low tap  though the third harmonic is only 7dB lower than the second Although highorder harmonics are also present these all lie at or below –80dB

output tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Finally as implied by the fact that the distortion percentage doesnt rise at the top of the audioband in fig11 the VK56SE did okay on the demanding twintone test of highfrequency intermodulation  At 1Wpc into 8 ohms from the Low tap the 1kHz difference tone was the highest in level at –54dB  in the left channel  and –57dB  in the right  As had been the case with the VK55SE the higherfrequency tones in this spectrum are surrounded by sideband pairs at ±120Hz and its harmonics suggesting that the amplifiers power supply is being stressed under these conditionsFig15 Balanced Audio Technology VK56SE Low output tap HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms Overall though the VK56SE measured similarly to its predecessor some aspects of its measured performance—the high output impedance the differences in noise and linearity between channels—bothered me But Im not surprised that HR preferred using the amplifiers Low output transformer taps these give the best measured performance especially into lower impedances while preserving the tube amplifier character
