PS Audio Sprout100 integrated DAC headphone power amplifier The Sprout100 upgrade original Sprout costs USD 599I remember first time I saw Sprout audio show I thought utterly cute It small handsome little package ton functionalityAs see addition functions I mentioned even Bluetooth included And moving magnet turntable input It dream product frustrated marketing guy highend audio company like PS Audio wanting mass market product appeals younger audience The volume control rotary encoder builtin switch powers unit If hold button LED color changes purple white indicating bass boost The rotary encoder poorly programmed linear slow response making slow change volume To go low high volume may turn seven eight times We live digital age music fast access comes levels Having ability quickly change volume importantInput selection old school mechanical selector I like clear labelsThe backside shows much crammed thereI test sub sensor automatically activates output In addition USB input also toslink optical nice case ground loopsThe nicest bit included power supply small package Kudos managing fit reduce clutterThere protection circuit power amplifier headphone During testing I found frequently activate simply turns unit It caused lot head scratching I discovered latter actionIt also I think underdesigned cooling perspective When I started DAC testing I dummy load connected unit well After minutes testing I noticed signal went away Then I realized per shut Went touch power button hot heck As rest enclosure super hot Even top wood panel hot touch I would rely 100 watt rating 4 ohm continuous rating length timeThe Sprout100 rated 100 watts 4 ohm according PS Audio uses ICEPower modulesI tell I hate testing multifunction devices like Every subsystem takes much time reviewing another product functionality In interest getting review done I bother test Vinyl input I also touch sub toslinkDAC MeasurementsThe inclusion line allows us test DAC subsystem independently lets start dashboard thereThe output variable I adjusted 2 volt Per review notes power amplifier whaling away dummy load timePS Audio rates Sprout100 less 001 THDN distortion line We beating although low bar Equivalent rating SINAD puts Sprout100 bottom quarter DACs reviewedNot good place although probably fits performance target created lifestyle product like thisBack THDN rating separate components distortion noise get ratioThey contributing final THDN noise bit dominant Likely small enclosure could get enough isolation DAC subsystem reduce noise levelsThe high noise level makes jitter graph pretty almost spikes visible noise floor elevatedBest class DACs put noise floor bottom graphSame noise problem manifests hugely linearity testThat smooth exponential rise indicates random noise polluting voltage reading level Noisefree performance stops around 80 dB 13 bits quit bit shy 16 bit performance CD In day age I like DAC least justice CD format bringing fully transparency 96 dBIntermodulation test shows similar higher noise floor also pretty early rising distortion levelsSimilar story THDN versus frequencyDynamic range DAC specdSpeaker Amplifier MeasurementsNote amplifier testing except noted AUX0040 Audio Precision filter place reduce high frequency components given fact switching amplifier designAs usual amplifiers I test 5 watt output The trick know use input level volume control With digital input easy I set level 0 dBFS But I thought want know performance amp alone better test analog input I gotWith digital input I could get 80 dB way But combination input volume level could get us analog input In sense amplifier good enough performance DACFrequency response showed different response channelI swapped loads curve change indicating variation due amplifier design differences loads Clearly channel blue resonating around 50 kHz causing large boost nearly 20 dB What get speaker load wiring unknown The red channel behaved We saw discrepancy channels SINAD dashboardPoking noise design using highbandwidth spectrum analysis see thisNote raw test external filter removed We clearly see switching frequency around 600 kHz peaking almost 20 dB You AM station like We early rise noise 100 kHz due kind noise shaping There lot spikes one could examine see going I lazy Regardless amplifiers pretty look far performance audible band It price pay 100 wattchannel amplifier squeezed little boxSpeaking power lets measure 4 ohm loadWe get 82 watts channels driven shy 100 watt specification Noise distortion lower Topping TP60 amplifier And powerSignal noise ratio OKHeadphone Amplifier MeasurementsLets jump right power versus distortion noise 300 ohmsWe competent level power much noise distortion reference Topping DX3 Pro I like see least 100 milliwatts Sprout100 deliversHere picture 33 ohmWe 420 milliwatts power Sprout100 shuts causing graph shoot back left In words unit distortionless shuts downOutput impedance bit high 57 ohmsHeadphone Listening TestI started testing Sennheiser HD650 There enough power good experience I could detect onset distortionSwitching Hifiman HE400i I got bit power clarity power endDedicated headphone amplifiers produce power enough either headphone give bit tingling ear lobes bass I happy I could get Sprout100 shut HE400i practice may serious problemConclusionThe reviews I read prior testing Sprout100 point great highend company like PS Audio produced mass market product And association must translating excellent sound Our objective measurements show case Performance subsystem DAC headphone amplifier nothing write home Subjective aspects though good lots power headphone amp extent power amplifierThe miss usability super slow change volume control In many cases I could move notch nothing would happen output analyzer let alone earsSo land From objective performance I cant say Sprout100 lives promise brand From full functionality point view 599 seems though although I yet test many products category For reason I going withhold giving holding back recommendation Let data guide regard
