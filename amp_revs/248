This follow first test Cambridge Audio CXA81 Results showed fair bit noise uncharacteristic products I tested company There lot speculation source problem data back Fortunately company CEO kind enough contact week later expressing surprised results I asked measurements better After investigation said could replicate results China manufacturing facility RD lab I expressed I longer unit work I could get bottom I offered new unit offer payment test I accepted second unit turn offer paymentIn communication I asked whether I lifted USB ground using switch back I ran tests second unit This unit groundedThe low frequency noise much lower sample still see channel red showing wide spectrum high frequency noise This reduced sinad fair bit compared good channel Lifting ground made better created new problemAt first appears harmonic distortion given spikes 2 34 5 etc KHz But USB micro packets 1 Kbytes frame boundaries showing leakage digital analog circuits So lifting ground really good solution although I appreciate may help systemsPost conference call designers product Issue brought instrumentation thing Audio Precision analyzer creating loop ground noise would While true I explained I tested hundreds DACs dont problem I seen exceptionally rare Since overall results positive first sample I offered rerun measurements post themA problem NOT disagreement output limit preout Like many AVRs lower I like see 15 volt Above saturate distortion increaseWith intro lets get measurements Company seen measurements agrees themCXA81 DAC Measurements I wanted break electrical link analyzer CXA81 started DAC testing using Toslink optical Here dashboardNote I picked max output output saturating If sweep input level see full range output relative distortionAs see 2 volts get SINAD 75 dB I measured first sample outputI next switched USB inputWe see noise intrusion reducing SINAD dBs relative TOSLINK optical Here key discovery though NOT due USB input mere connection USB cable You see noise even Toslink I USB plugged Turns noise issue proceed corrupt measurements subsystems reason amplifier example perform well either first round The impact second unit lower first sample though This could due noise conditions changing test system something different second sampleTo eliminate USB noise factor I continued rest DAC tests using Toslink lets go quicklyLinearity test impacted another rare issue power supply noise close test tone 200 Hz I use There strong bandpass filter enough get rid thatWe see clear jitter sources benign audiblyIMD test shows noise I like see good limit beating reference DAC blueHere reconstruction filterAnd THDN vs frequencyPreamp MeasurementsHere see impact connecting USB cable testing analog inanalog outPower Amplifier MeasurementsLets start usual dashboardThis average amplifiers tested date far better noiseinduced measurements first sample Distortion 100 dB goodPower sweeps much improved due lower noiseWe see various frequencies wellThe lower amount noise allows distinction test tonesConclusionsThe second sample combined connecting USB cable shows CXA81 much better light Performance competent class transparent uses Where would one put blame noise induced using USB Me Instrumentation Vagueness computer audiogrounding Some When testing AVRs I started testing Toslink remove issues related HDMI I opted since I consider unit different class Still I take blame done returning unit As I expressed company though problem devices I implore investigate use variability After system may much worse configuration downstream devices upstream computer may present even worse situation One likes take comfort thinking one digital input anotherAs tough situation cant leave USB cable connected lest degrade performance rest system If dont audible issue concern experiment removing USB cable see fixes problemFor personally USB connection critical input I would use combo device So something works But may fine youI also like see output levels 2 volts unbalanced without saturating We seeing AVRAVP companies going way No reason different combo device like Higher output level gives better freedom use external amplifiersFinally let express sincere deep appreciate Cambridge Audio company CEO accepting challenging results first test working better clarity constructive path forward In regard earn highest levels respect I look forward quality products come across bench
