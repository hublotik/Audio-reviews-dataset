0, MBL Reference 9011 I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before doing the testing I ran the MBL serial number 40431 at onethird its rated power for 30 minutes which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage  At the end of that period the chassis was only mildly warm However the third section of heatsinks from the front on the amplifiers righthand side was hottish at 115°F  The amplifier was tested as a bridged monoblock as that is how MF used the pair of 9011s in his auditioning with all three AC transformers active The voltage gain into 8 ohms from the balanced input assessed between the two positive terminal posts  was 271dB The 9011 preserved absolute polarity when the positive speaker lead was connected to the uppermost binding post The balanced input impedance was the specified 20k ohms in the bass and midrange dropping slightly to 16k ohms at the top of the audiobandThe output impedance was very low at 005 ohm at 1kHz and below rising to 01 ohm at 20kHz  As a result the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was minimal  This graph also shows that into higher impedances the MBL 9011 has a very wide smallsignal bandwidth its response into 8 ohms  dropping by just 165dB at 200kHz The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave therefore has a superbly square shape with very low risetimes Fig1 MBL Reference 9011 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 MBL Reference 9011 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe amplifiers ultrasonic output decreases into lower impedances however the response being –3dB at 85kHz into 2 ohms  Even so with an amplifier with a wide bandwidth like this it is important to use interconnects that are correctly shielded The amplifier might not go into overload as happened with MFs TARA Labs and ZenSati interconnects but the presence of RF interference can still have an unpredictable effect on sound qualityWhen  Ypsilon BC1 transformers Michael used to convert the VST100 MkII preamplifiers singleended output to balanced these both broke the ground connection between preamp and power amps and had a frequency response that rose significantly above the audioband  Both of these factors exacerbated the MBL 9011s possible susceptibility to picking up RF interference particularly with the unshielded ZenSati interconnectsEven with its wide smallsignal bandwidth the Reference 9011 was a quiet amplifier Its unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms was 837dB with all ACsupply–related components lying below 100dB The Aweighted ratio again ref 2828V into 8 ohms was a superb 1027dBA equivalent to 130dBA ref the measured clipping power into 8 ohms  which was 540W  almost 1dB greater than the specified 440W  This amplifier has true 20bit dynamic range The amplifier clipped at 870W into 4 ohms  compared with the specified 840W  but fell below its specified power of 1390W into 2 ohms  at a measured 1190W  This is most likely because I dont hold the AC wall voltage steady during these tests It was 1221V with the amplifier idling 121V with the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms but 1174V at clipping into 2 ohmsFig3 MBL Reference 9011 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig4 MBL Reference 9011 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig5 MBL Reference 9011 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsTo ensure that I was measuring actual distortion rather than noise I examined how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 25V output Even so as shown in fig6 the MBL 9011 was extremely linear Into 8 and 4 ohms  the rise in THD in the treble was minuscule though it was more pronounced into 2 ohms  The distortion was predominantly third harmonic in nature  though this was still very low in level  Intermodulation distortion with the punishing equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones tested at a level about 3dB below visual clipping on the oscilloscope was also low  The difference product at 1kHz was at –120dB  though the higherorder products were up to 20dB higher in levelFig6 MBL Reference 9011 THDN  vsfrequency at 25V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 MBL Reference 9011 1kHz waveform at 507W into 4 ohms  00045 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 MBL Reference 9011 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 400Wpc into 4 ohms Fig9 MBL Reference 9011 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 400W peak into 4 ohms The MBL Reference 9011 measures superbly as I have come to expect from this German manufacturer There doesnt appear to be any technical reasons why the 9011 would sound different from the Reference 9007 which from my experience sounds very much like Michael described it in his 2006 review But owners should both take their dealers advice on what cables are best to use with this very–widebandwidth amplifier and use it with preamplifiers having a true balanced output
