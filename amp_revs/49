0, Bryston B1353   The review sample was not fitted with the optional phono and digital input modules Before I performed the testing  amplifier by running it at oneeighth its specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes as recommended by the CEA After preconditioning the heatsinks on the amplifiers sides were too hot to touch at 1485°F  The top panel was also hot at 1064°F  This amplifier needs plenty of ventilationThe voltage gain at the loudspeaker outputs loaded with 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum was 411dB typical of a solidstate integrated amplifier The maximum gain at the preamplifier outputs was 121dB and at the headphone outputs it was 276dB The power amplifier section can be driven independently it offered a gain of 291dB into 8 ohms All the inputs and outputs preserved absolute polarity ie were noninvertingThe input impedance at 20Hz and 1kHz was higher than the specified 30k ohms at 47k ohms dropping inconsequentially to 42k ohms at 20kHz The input impedance for the power amplifier section was 30k ohms across the audioband The output impedance at both the preamplifier and headphone outputs was 71 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals  was very low at 009 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 015 ohm at 20kHz The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker therefore varied by just ±01dB  The response into 8 ohms  reached –3dB at 65kHz though the response at the preamplifier and headphone outputs was not down by 3dB until 190kHz  These graphs were taken with the volume control set to its maximum the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control The B1353s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured short risetimes with no overshoot or ringingFig1 Bryston B1353 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig1 Bryston B1353 headphone output frequency response at 1V into 300 ohms  Fig3 Bryston B1353 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was 75dB in both directions below 5kHz dropping to 67dB at the top of the audioband Measured with the singleended inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the Brystons wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio was 665dB ref 1W into 8 ohms in both channels This ratio improved to 717dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 744dB when the reading was Aweighted The magenta and red traces in fig4 taken at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum reveal spuriae at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics Reducing the volume control by 20dB and increasing the input voltage to give the same 1Wpc into 8 ohms  reduces the level of these spuriae by 20dB which suggests they may be due to the preamplifier circuitry picking up magnetic interference from the power transformerFig4 Bryston B1353 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to maximum  and set to –20dB  Repeating the spectral analysis with the power amplifier section driven directly  indicated that the primary spurious tone was 60Hz at –80dB  The signal noise ratio with this input shorted to ground  was 77dB  866dB  and 893dB  This supports my supposition that the higher level of noise with the volume control set to its maximum is due to the B1353s preamplifier sectionFig5 Bryston B1353 power amplifier input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  I examined how the percentage of THDN varied with output power clipping was defined as when the THDnoise in the amplifiers output reached 1 With both channels driven into 8 ohms the B1353 exceeded its specified maximum power of 135W  clipping at 155Wpc  The clipping power into 4 ohms again with both channels driven was 230Wpc  With both channels driven the Bryston clipped at 165Wpc into 2 ohms  The downward slope of the traces in figs6 and 7 indicates that actual distortion decreases beneath the noisefloor at powers below clipping  I examined how the THDN percentage varied with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms The results are shown in fig8 The distortion and noise remain very low over most of the audioband with only small rises in the top and bottom octaves particularly in the right channel Fig6 Bryston B1353 THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 Bryston B1353 THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig8 Bryston B1353 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The waveform of the THDN at 50Wpc into 8 ohms after the 1kHz fundamental had been notched out  suggests that the third harmonic is the highest in level it is overlaid with analog noise However when spectrum of the Brystons output as it drove 50Hz at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  the second harmonic lay at –106dB  which was a little higher than the third harmonic in the left channel  If higherorder harmonics are present they are obscured by the power supply–related spuriae  Repeating the spectral analysis using the power amplifier inputs  confirmed that the second harmonic was the highest in level and that the third harmonic was a little higher in the right channel than the left at –108dB vs –119dB All the values are very lowFig9 Bryston B1353 1kHz waveform at 50Wpc into 8 ohms 00044 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched

of the B1353s output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 50Wpc  The secondorder difference product at 1kHz and the higherorder intermodulation products all lay close to a negligible –110dB Fig12 Bryston B1353 power amplifier input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms The Bryston B1353 offers extremely low levels of distortion Background noise will be at its lowest when the volume control is below the maximum
