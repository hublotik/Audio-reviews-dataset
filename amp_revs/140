0, AVM Ovation A62 ME    amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes The manual states that the A 62 ME can get warm At the end of the preconditioning its heatsinks were very hot at 1323°F  and the top panels temperature was 1104°F  Operating the amplifier at the older IHF recommendation for preconditioning—both channels driven at onethird power for 60 minutes—the temperatures increased slightly with the heatsink measuring 140°F  and the top panel measuring 1139°F  Be sure to give this amplifier plenty of ventilationI looked first at the AVMs behavior via its line inputs mostly with the volume control set to its maximum of 995 then at lower settings With the optional attenuation bypassed with the menu the maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was a high 478dB for both the balanced and singleended inputs With the attenuation switched into the circuit set to 6dB the gain was reduced by exactly 6dB  The maximum gain at the headphone outputs was 2175dB without attenuation 1575dB with 6dB attenuation At the preamplifier output the maximum gain was 122dB with and without attenuation The Ovation A 62 preserved absolute polarity at its loudspeaker preamplifier and headphone outputs  for both balanced and singleended line inputsThe Ovation A 62 MEs singleended input impedance was 10k ohms at low and midrange frequencies dropping slightly to 94k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was lower at 68k ohms across the audioband The singleended preamplifier output impedance was a low 468 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The balanced impedance was exactly twice that value as expected The headphone output impedance was a very low 05 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz but rose to a stilllow 76 ohms at 20kHz The AVM should not have problems driving lowimpedance headphones The amplifiers output impedance was a very low 007 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 009 ohms at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was minimal  The smallsignal bandwidth into resistive loads with the volume control set to its maximum was flat to 20kHz not reaching –3dB into 8 ohms until 120kHz  although a slight 015dB channel imbalance can be seen in this graph This wide smallsignal bandwidth was preserved at lower settings of the volume control The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured very short risetimes A slight amount of overshoot can be seen but there was no ringing A 1kHz squarewave was perfectly square Fig1 AVM Ovation A 62 ME frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 AVM Ovation A 62 ME smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 AVM Ovation A 62 ME smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Treble and Bass controls each offer seven steps of boost or cut Their effect set to 7 and –7 with the volume control set to 795 is shown as the blue and red traces in fig4 Each step of the Treble control boosts or cuts the output above 10kHz by 2dB The Bass control operates in smaller steps but instead of a conventional Baxandalltype control it boosts or cuts the output between 50Hz and 500Hz and rolls off the output below 50Hz The Contour control provides a traditional Loudness function for lowlevel listening and has 10 settings The green and gray traces in fig4 were taken with it set to the maximum The treble is boosted by 55dB and the 50–500Hz region by the same amount as when the Bass control was set to 7 With the Contour set to 3 the treble is very slightly attenuated and the bass boost peaks just above 4dBFig4 AVM Ovation A 62 ME response with Treble and Bass controls set to 0and ±7 and Contour set to Off  and with Contour set to 10  and 3  Channel separation  was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 80dB at the top of the audioband With the unbalanced input shorted to ground the volume control set to its maximum and attenuation bypassed the wideband unweighted SN ratio was 591dB  ref 283V output into 8 ohms Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 68dB while switching an Aweighting filter into circuit further improved the ratio to 703dB Activating the attenuation increased all these ratios by around 3dB The level of the Ovation A 62s noise floor depended on the volume control setting Even with the control set to its maximum no supplyrelated spuriae were present in the amplifiers lowfrequency output spectrum  When the volume control was set to –20dB  the random noise was lowered by 20dB which shows that the source of the noise which in any case is probably inconsequential is before the volume controlFig5 AVM Ovation A 62 ME spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with attenuation active and volume control set to –20dB  and its maximum To reduce the influence of the random noise floor on the distortion measurements I performed all of these with the attenuation active and the volume control set to –20dB AVM specifies the Ovation A 62 MEs maximum power as 300Wpc into 4 ohms  With both channels driven and using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the amplifier clipped at 190Wpc into 8 ohms  315Wpc into 4 ohms  and 505W  with one channel driven into 2 ohms  The headphone output clipped asymmetrically at just over 1V into 300 ohms under all circumstances measured with attenuation active or bypassed with both balanced and unbalanced input signals and regardless of the volume control setting This will not be an issue with highsensitivity headphones but it correlates with Herbs observation that the AVM couldnt drive his lowsensitivity HiFiMan Susvaras to appropriate levels without clippingFig6 AVM Ovation A 62 ME distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 AVM Ovation A 62 ME distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig8 AVM Ovation A 62 ME distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsAs the distortion at low powers was very low I measured how the Ovation A 62s distortion changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN percentage was very low into all three impedances at low frequencies  but the increase in the treble implies a relatively restricted openloop bandwidth Fig9 AVM Ovation A 62 ME THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The distortion was predominantly the third harmonic  with the higher oddorder harmonics all lying below –100dB and decreasing in a linear manner with frequency   The reduction in highfrequency linearity seen in fig7 led to the production of highorder intermodulation products with an equal highpower mix of 19kHz and 20Hz tones  The difference product at 1kHz lay at a low –86dB  howeverFig10 AVM Ovation A 62 ME 1kHz

62 ME HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms Other than the random noise that comes before the volume control and the reduction in linearity in the treble octaves the AVM Ovation A 62 ME did well on the test bench slightly exceeding its specified power I was puzzled by the headphone jacks limited output voltage but that might well be a samplespecific problem
