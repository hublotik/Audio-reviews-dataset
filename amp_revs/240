0, NAD M10 streaming amplifier and DAC It was purchased and drop shipped to me kindly by a member It costs US 2749 from NAD dealersThe M10 sports a very large touch screen LCD display that covers the entire front faceSorry for leaving the protecting plastic on Like to keep things as new as possible for membersAs nice as the display is it simply is not as responsive as your phone or tablet What could be really cool such as the VU meter mode becomes a jittery display that doesnt please much A much faster processor with GPU would be needed to really make the display the star Still it is heads and shoulders above others that have small displaysThe back panel is notable for inclusion of HDMI ARC inputAlas I have no ARC capability on my workstation so could not test that featureIn normal use the plastic case barely gets warm Under heavy stress of power testing it got somewhat warm making me wish the case was made out of aluminum than plastic You are not likely to push the switching amplifiers this hard and at any rate the M10 runs much cooler than any AudioVideo ReceiverWhile I did not have time to test it the M10 comes with Dirac Room EQ which is niceI noticed one operationaldesign issue I unplugged the unit to take its picture but noticed that the display went crazy flashing random stuff I thought it was a capacitor that was discharging but this continued and would not stop I looked in the back and I realized I still had the HDMI cable plugged in Knowing that it provides a 5 volt hot plug signal I disconnected it and the display finally shut down This is improper design The device must NOT draw any power out of HDMI connectionDAC Audio MeasurementsI connected the Coax output of my Audio Precision APx555 analyzer to the M10 and measured what came out of the preout with volume adjusted for 2 volt outputDistortion is quite low at 110 dB  but the noise floor kept jumping up and down causing SINAD to vary with it This shows lack of isolation between sensitive DAC subsystem and busy processor running other functions of the device As it is performance is respectable which is a sigh of reliefAnything in green and blue is goodTesting at other output levels shows that the M10 is capable of pumping out good bit of voltageDynamic range clears the bar for 16 bit CDstreaming content but not much moreIMD distortion versus level shows the same noise issueFilter response also shows higher than it should be noise floorJitter and noise test shows a lot of unwanted tones but audibly they are below threshold of hearingLinearity is very goodEDIT forgot to include multitone in the original reviewFinally we see the penalty of the DAC filter not being sharp enough in distortionnoise versus frequencyAmplifier Audio MeasurementsI was hoping that analog input was not digitized but alas it isAnd at very low sample rate Maybe there is a setting to change this but I did not bother to lookUsing the same analog input I witnessed wild swings in noise floor of the unitSo I abandoned the analog input and switched to Coax for the rest of the amplifier testsPerformance is improved and stable as well This rates the M10 above average for more than 100 amplifiers tested so farSignal to noise ratio is disappointing as even with full power it barely clears the 16 bit hurdleFrequency response using digital input is wide enoughBut for those people with ultra sensitive high frequency hearing you will lose half a dB at 20 kHzLets see how much clean power we get out of M10 starting with 4 ohm loadI allowed the distortion to go higher  and got even more powerI tried to get the burst power rating but some kind of limiter in the M10 was fighting the analyzer and wouldnt allow me to get there It was nice that it would not shut downPower naturally drops at 8 ohmConclusionsPerformance of the NAD M10 is generally acceptable especially for a multifunction device where we see a lot of fails Alas issues here and there took away my enthusiasm for it There is no excuse for poor analog input performance in a nearly 3000 device Or rather high and variable noise floorSo overall I gave it a like it panther award but it is not something I would personally buy I can be stubborn that way
