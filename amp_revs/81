0, Parasound Halo A 21    amplifier by operating it at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour  At the end of this time the sidemounted heatsinks were very hot at 1628°F  The top panel was also hot at 116°F The Parasounds voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 292dB from the balanced inputs 294dB from the unbalanced inputs In bridgedmono mode the gain was 349dB into 8 ohms The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with both balanced and unbalanced input signals and with the right channel used as the input in bridgedmono mode with the outputs taken from the two positive loudspeaker terminals as described in the manual The balanced input impedance was high at 90k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to a stillhigh 84k ohms at 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance was 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies 37k ohms at the top of the audiobandThe Parasounds output impedance was a very low 0077 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasingly slightly to 01 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore minuscule at ±01dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was flat to almost 20kHz which correlates with the A 21s superb reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  Fig1 was taken with the balanced inputs the response with the unbalanced input was identical though in bridgedmono mode the output at 20kHz was down by a stilltrivial 025dB due to the doubling of the amplifiers output impedance in this mode A slight 035dB channel imbalance in favor of the left channel  can be seen in fig1 even though the level controls for the two channels had both been set to their maximum positionsFig1 Parasound A21 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Parasound A21 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 90dB in both directions below 2kHz declining to a stillgood 72dB at the top of the audioband Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was 781dB ref 1W into 8 ohms  this ratio improving to 887dB when the measurement was Aweighted Lowlevel spuriae at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its odd harmonics were present in the Parasounds noise floor  These will be due to magnetic interference from the massive toroidal power transformer and were a little higher in the left channel  than the right  There were also evenorder harmonics of the powerline frequency present but these are also very low in levelFig3 Parasound A21 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Parasound specifies the A 21 as delivering 300W into 8 ohms  with both channels driven and 500W into 4 ohms  Using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the Parasound easily exceeded its specified powers with both channels driven with a 1kHz signal It clipped at 400Wpc into 8 ohms  and at 620Wpc into 4 ohms  The maximum power into 2 ohms with one channel driven was 900W  while in bridgedmono mode into 8 ohms—the recommended minimum load in this mode—the amplifier clipped at 1100W Fig4 Parasound A21 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Parasound A21 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe shape of the traces in figs4 and 5 suggested that I examine how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN was very low in the midrange into 8 4 and 2 ohms  but rose at higher frequencies The A 21s distortion was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  and higher harmonics are all very low in level  The second harmonic lies at –74dB in this graph and didnt rise in level with a 4 ohm load When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50W into 8 ohms  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –86dB  and higherorder intermodulation products were even lower in level Again the levels of the distortion harmonics didnt rise when I kept the output voltage the same but reduced the load impedance to 4 ohmsFig6 Parasound A21 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Parasound A21 1kHz waveform at 25W into 8 ohms 001 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Parasound A21 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Fig9 Parasound A21 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms The Parasound A 21 offers a lot of lowdistortion power and isnt fazed by impedances as low as 2 ohms
