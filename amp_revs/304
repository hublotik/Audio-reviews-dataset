0, vintage Audio Research D300 Power Amplifier  a local member The D300 came out circa 1995 and initially cost US 3500 but then price rose to US 4000 Quick search shows used ones going for US 1500The D300 is built like a tankI am confident you could drive over it and nothing will happen to it Even the handles are massive which is a blessing as an ultra heavy transformer sits vertically behind the front panel I could carry the D300 by myself so it is not too heavy to be unmanageable The back panel is as you expectWith one exception the nondetachable power cord  What is there though seems amply sufficient as it is supple yet quite thickHeatsinks are very thick gauge and in use they got warm but not hot The rest of the case got warm as well The amp never complained no matter what I did to it in testingOverall if you want an understated but high quality feel that is what you have in D300Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm loadOuch Lots of second harmonic causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion and noise to be rather poor As such the D300 lands well below average in our list of some 62 amplifiers tested to dateNoise performance was quite good though so it is the distortion that is the problem32tone test signal representing music showed what we already know as far as rather high distortion levelsFrequency response was excellentAs was crosstalk Lets get into the meat of the measurements with power vs THDN starting at 4 ohmBoy this is worse than the dashboard indicated Almost immediately distortion takes over and keeps climbing While the D300 is much more quiet it quickly loses to an integrated home theater receiver  Not goodSame story repeats for 8 ohm loadDistortion is so high at higher power levels that if we set a limit of 01 for THDN we only get 60 watts out of each channelRelaxing that to 02 though gave us a lot more power and no indication of frequency mattering This was proven yet again in our multiple sweepsAll the lines fall on top of each other indicating the amp just doesnt care what frequency you feed it It amplifies it adds a heap of distortion and that is that Makes you want to cry and celebrate at the same timeConclusionsThere is clear excellence in the engineering in Audio Research D300 Build quality is superb as well There must have been a conscious decision to use low amount of feedback which translated into rising distortion with power It is a shame that capable designers follow audiophile myths to build nonperformant amplifiers when they could do so much betterIn this day and age this type of performance is not competitive so I really cant recommend the D300 Then again if you want something with high build quality and can get the unit on the cheap it makes for a decent option As always questions comments corrections etc are welcomeEver walk through a highend department store and get hounded by the ladies selling perfume I know to ignore them but the pink panther I was taking for a walk there fell for it and made me buy him a fancy bottle for 100 Needless to say I feel poor so could use some extra money Please donate using
