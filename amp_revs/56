0, Pass Labs XA605s  for an hour at onethird its specified maximum power of 60W into 8 ohms This is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage A classA amplifier however runs hottest when it is idling By the end of the hour the top panel was warm at 107°F  and the sidemounted heatsinks were hot at 120°F  With the amplifier idling for another hour the heatsink temperature had risen to 124°F  the top panel to 108°F   using Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was very slightly higher than the specified 26dB at 264dB balanced and 2655dB unbalanced  The amplifier was noninverting  with both input modes The input impedance was 17k ohms 20Hz–20kHz for both balanced and unbalanced signalsThe XA605s output impedance including 6 of speaker cable was 01 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 02 ohm at 20kHz The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was a mild ±01dB  Into an 8 ohm resistive load  the XA605s response was flat up to 20kHz then rolled off to reach –3dB at 102kHz The response rolled off a little earlier into lower impedances but was still just 05dB down at 20kHz into 2 ohms  With this wide a smallsignal bandwidth the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured short risetimes and a good square shape Fig1 Pass Labs XA605 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Pass Labs XA605 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground was a good 79dB This improved to 866dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and further still to 887dB when the measurement was Aweighted Fig3 indicates that both the odd and even harmonics of the 60Hz powersupply frequency were present though these all lay at or below –100dB ref 1W into 8 ohmsFig3 Pass Labs XA605 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The needle of the frontpanel meter remained just to the left of 1200 at 8ohm powers below 60W At 60W it moved slightly to the right reaching 100 at 100W into 8 ohms and 130 at 120W Specified as putting out 60W into 8 ohms  the XA605 considerably exceeded that power delivering at 1 THD 130W into 8 ohms  210W into 4 ohms  and 330W into 2 ohms  The THD starts to rise above the noise floor at high powers but is very low at powers of a few watts with a 1kHz signal even into 2 ohms The percentage of THD then slowly rises with increasing power suggesting that the XA605 has only a small amount of corrective feedback Fig4 Pass Labs XA605 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Pass Labs XA605 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Pass Labs XA605 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDNoise changed with frequency at 9V a level where I could be sure from the earlier measurements that I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise The THD was extremely low in the midrange  and hardly changed with load impedance something that I conjecture is associated with good sound quality as the amplifiers fundamental transfer function is not being modulated by the output current However the THD did rise linearly as the frequency rose—which I conjecture suggests that the circuit has a limited openloop bandwidth Fig7 Pass Labs XA605 THDN  vs frequency at 9V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fortunately the XA605s distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous thirdharmonic in nature at both moderate  and high  powers though the second fifth and seventh harmonics can also be seen in fig9 all close to the –100dB level  With the topoctave decrease in linearity seen in fig7 it came as no surprise to see some highorder intermodulation products that were fairly high in level when the XA605 was asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen  However the subjectively more objectionable secondorder product at 1kHz is almost 50dB lower at –100dB Fig8 Pass Labs XA605 1kHz waveform at 20W into 4 ohms 002 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Pass Labs XA605 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 120W into 4 ohms Fig10 Pass Labs XA605 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 120W peak into 4 ohms The Pass Labs XA605s measured performance is very similar to that of the stereo XA305  which was favorably reviewed for Stereophile by Brian Damkroger in May 2009 and by Erick Lichte in December 2009 Both are well engineered and each delivered more power than its modest specification would suggest
