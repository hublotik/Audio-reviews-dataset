0, boXem ARTHUR 2408N2 stereo class D amplifier It was kindly sent to me by  costs â‚¬64900 Tax excluded I really like the differentiated look of the unit with custom front panel and white case which you can see better in this shotNotice the ultra high quality and large binding posts and nice power switch Input is only balanced XLR as you see I believe the heart of the unit is Hypex NC122MPboXem ARTHUR 2408N2 MeasurementsThe unit stabilized quickly with its performance hardly changing Here is our dashboardThis level of distortion and noise  nicely landed the amp into our excellent categorySignal to noise ratio was excellent achieving better than CD dynamic range at just 5 watts of outputTypical of Hypex amplifiers  is lack of load impedance dependency which plagues many budget class D amplifiersThe 2408N2 achieved one of the lowest crosstalk I have measuredMultitone results are very good as wellLets see how much power we haveNot a ton but it is above average as far as noise and distortion Allowing a bit more distortion we getWhich is right on the money as far as company specifications Here is 8 ohm performanceChecking for frequency dependence we see well behaved responseBut note the loss of power with 20 Hz inputFinally here is the switching and ultrasonic performanceI checked the unit for temperature after all the test and could barely feel any rise above room temp on any of the surfacesConclusionsThe Arthur 2408 comes in an attractive and differentiated package with very high quality connectivity Measured performance is hugely above average although not state of the art I could not find any weakness in its performance no matter which way I measured it  a sign of excellent engineering The cost is up there though for the level of power you get Seeing how company is represented here  support should be easy as wellI am happy to recommend the boXem ARTHUR 2408N2 EDIT teardown is also available always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
