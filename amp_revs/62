0, one Pass Labs XA2008  for an hour at onethird its measured maximum power into 8 ohms—thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage but not for a true classA amplifier which runs at its hottest with no signal By the end of the hour the top panel was warm at 994°F  and the sidemounted heatsinks were hotter at 1181°F  Although Pass Labs specifies the XA2008 operating in classA I suspect that even with its massive heatsinking the amplifier doesnt have sufficient bias current to allow classA operation up to its specified maximum power    The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was slightly lower than the specified 26dB at 2485dB for the balanced input and the expected 6dB lower for the unbalanced input  The amplifier was noninverting  with both inputs Its balanced input impedance was the specified 100k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping slightly to 93k ohms at 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance is specified as 50k ohms my estimate was 55k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 38k ohms at 20kHzThe XA2008s output impedance was 011 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 015 ohm at 20kHz The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±01dB  Into an 8 ohm resistive load  the XA2008s response was flat up to 20kHz then rolled off to reach –3dB around 120kHz The response rolled off a little earlier into lower impedances but was still just 05dB down at 20kHz into 2 ohms  With this wide a smallsignal bandwidth the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured short risetimes and a wellsquared shape Fig1 Pass Labs XA2008 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Pass Labs XA2008 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground was an excellent 83dB This improved to 882dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband—and was even better at 921dB when the measurement was Aweighted Like the other Pass Labs amplifiers we have reviewed the XA2008 is quiet As with the XA608 monoblock that we reviewed in December 2017 both the odd and even harmonics of the 60Hz powersupply frequency were present in the amplifiers noise floor though these all lay at or below –100dB ref 1W into 8 ohms Fig3 Pass Labs XA2008 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The XA2008 is specified as delivering 200W into 8 ohms  Using our definition of clipping—ie when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1—the Pass Labs amplifier clipped at 258W into 8 ohms  480W into 4 ohms  and 700W into 2 ohms  The THD begins to rise above the noise floor at powers greater than a couple of watts but remains at or below 01 below 100W into any of these impedances As with the XA608 the percentage of THDN in the XA2008s output slowly rises with increasing power suggesting that the amplifier uses only a small amount of corrective feedbackFig4 Pass Labs XA2008 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Pass Labs XA2008 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Pass Labs XA2008 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDN changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN was extremely low in the midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  and still below 01 into 2 ohms  It rose linearly as the frequency increased the three traces converging in the high treble—which suggests that again like the XA608 the circuit has limited openloop bandwidthFig7 Pass Labs XA2008 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fortunately the XA2008s distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  Still at low frequencies into lower impedances the second harmonic rises to equal the level of the third and some higherorder harmonics appear  though the latter all lie at or below –100dB Fig8 Pass Labs XA2008 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 006 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Pass Labs XA2008 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms As with the other Pass Labs XAseries amplifiers we have reviewed the XA2008s topoctave decrease in linearity  is associated with some higherorder intermodulation products that were fairly high in level when the amplifier was asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at high power into 4 ohms  Even so the secondorder difference product at 1kHz which will be more audible than the higherorder products lies at a low –74dB Fig10 Pass Labs XA2008 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Fig11 Pass Labs XA2008 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms The measured performance of the Pass Laboratories XA2008 reveals some wellbalanced audio engineering
