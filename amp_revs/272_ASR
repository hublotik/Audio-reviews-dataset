3e Audio SYDAP2002 stereo desktop DSP amplifier Bluetooth drop shipped I also teardown test upgraded opamps I went look price says longer available I think US 116The enclosure heftier typical classA cute set white LEDs rotate around volume control first turned indicate volume level An unusual twist class amplifier inclusion mains power supplyNo figure8 power cord included however I supply As see little fan help cooling never came testing I top open touching heatsinks showed pretty cool explains fan staying offNote DSP subsystem I test It based Sigma ADAU1701 platform I already reviewed Amplification provided using ST Micro TPA3255 chipSYDAP2002 MeasurementsI started testing using stock configurationDistortion quite low 95 dB however SINAD way worse 72 dB indicating noise limiting factor Dont confused 100 dB noise floor FFT That 35 dB FFT gain The owner warned noise indeed gone ahead purchased recommended upgrade opamps LM 4562 I took top swapped performance indeed improvedNoise still dominates though performance continues averageYou see effect noise SNR testsHere comparison noise input signal without opamp upgradeFrequency response limited based digitization load dependencyCrosstalk generally good somewhat variableMultitone test shows low distortion alas high noise floorHealthy amount power available shut downBecause aggressive protection circuit I could get 1 THD measure max peak powerGood bit power available 8 ohm indicating 4 ohm performance current limitedTransfer function quite good switching amplifierSYDAP2002 TeardownOverall construction seems reasonably cleanTop row switching power supply naturally highvoltage rectified mains As I would liked see routed slot addition existing isolation exists PCB That would reduce chances arcing high voltage side low voltage amplifierCapacitors lower grade usual least ones I looked higher grade 105 degree C The heatsink quite beefy size seemed job keeping TPA3255 chip amp cool testing I sure fan good since likely pushes air vents push air High static pressure reduces effectiveness although likely better nothing I like Bluetooth antenna lead travelling front board mains side The noise switching power supply may reduce Bluetooth range rate safe place lead come touch highvoltage areas power supply The RCA cables could moved bit made room available low voltage sectionI see regulatory safety certifications good mains powered gearOverall nearly bad could ConclusionsGetting DSP platform topflight chip amp power supply small box takes good bit effort Overall bad platform compromises performance dropping chip amp Personally I use DSP upstream use amp configuration performance hit good book But decide otherwiseI could recommended amp seeing I upgrade opamp get good performance I going pass
