0, Audiophonics HPAS400ET  after member request and costs 1 49000 â‚¬ I must say this is one of the best packaging of class D amplifiers  that I have seen It is slick and has style While the heatsink on one side is cosmetic the other is connected to the power supply power transistors although in use nothing rose above room temperature Back panel shows extremely high quality speaker connectionsYou can see it better with the lid openI must say this is so clean you can eat of of it  I simply cannot find any fault with the assembly and design Bottom to modules are Purifi 1ET400A modules fed by their own custom bufferpreamp gain stage Jumpers let you select from different settings Audiophonics HPAS400ET MeasurementsGiven the three different gain stages it was a challenge to decide what to test so that this job doesnt become nearly infinite in scope I will first show you the dashboard for all three gains starting from high gainThis is superb performance already with distortion products at 125 dB Channel matching is excellent Here is medium gain petformanceThis is a nice setting as max power is achieved at 4 volts meaning you can use all of our moderndesktop amps to drive the unit and gain a bit of performanceIf you have a pro interface that goes up to 10 volts out you can utilize the low gain modeThis gain is actually close to how I measured our two top performers  so lets see how the Audiophonics ranksLooking at top 20 we seeAmazing performance Measuring SNR at low and medium gain we getOK from here on I am going to stick with low gain mode Here is our multitoneStellar as expected Crosstalk manages to actually land in 1 position of any amplifier testedFrequency response is dead flat with no load dependencyLets sweep and see how we do with 4 ohm loadExcellent performance Here is how much power we get if we allow more distortionSwitching to 8 ohm we see that the performance actually exceeds than of Purifi Testing at other frequencies we still have great performanceFinally the amplifier is stable at power up so no need to wait for it to warm upConclusionsThe Audiophonics HPAS400ET comes in a beautiful package with super performance to match its good looks Yes it builds on Purifis excellent platform but they managed to add value without messing with its performance The gain settings are well thought through The whole thing is so well executed and must be a delight to our European members who can buy it locally Having been built in France it is also a feather in the cap of our French members I am happy to give my strongest recommendation to Audiophonics HPAS400ET You have a lot of power with superb fidelity and transparencyEdit video review just posted
