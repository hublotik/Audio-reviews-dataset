0,The design of the Vera Audio P150600 RS is complete The price is 29 600 NOK exclusive tax and shipping Due to the corona situation and a delay with chassises it will be a while before we have a decent number in quantity We only have a few for sales at the moment and thats the reason it hasnt been announced yet But I thought I would share some details for those who have an interestIn 4 Ohm it delivers 1kW with amazingly low 00006 THDN This is bridged but it says a lot about the performance The notches you see in the graph below comes from our measuring equipment switching measuring area and isnt able to keep up with such low numbers The actual distortion around 50500W is even lower Probably down towards 000025In stereo mode it gives out 290W in 4 Ohm with the same low distortionThe linearity is also in its own class  0025dB from 20Hz to 20kHz 3dB at 60kHzThe noise as low as 17uV CMRRThis is something we have spent a lot of resources on Briefly said CMRR is the the amplifiers ability to supress noise that comes from the outside through cables Everything over 100dB is considered expectionally goodHeres the measurement of the gain adjustments This is also something we have spent a lot of time on to get accurateYou can see that the maximum deviation is 001dBThe chassis of the amplifier is cut out from a whole block of aluminium and there are no visible screws or seams Its of very high quality and part of the reason our amplifier cost what it does besides extremely accurate gain adjustments bridging option etcSome more info from our enigneer Armand We use a huge power supply of 3kW This has plenty more capacity and runs cooler at heavy loads It will also result in much lower distortion at low frequencies  Our amplifier is  the only Purifi model that has bridging capability A lot of testing has been done and special considerations are in place to make this work as it should Looking at the measurements of 1kW with 00006 distortion proves this is flawless We deliver real measurements of the whole amplifier from input to output measured with a RS Audio analyzer  The noise THDN and power delivery presented by others on specification sheets are in several cases only copied from the Purifi 1ET400A datasheet and do not tell the whole story Internal layout audio buffer power supply cooling capacity all play a role into the final result We use a microcontroller that constantly monitors the 1ET400A modules Temperatures voltages overcurrent clipping error modes etc The RGB LED on the front will warn the user if the amplifier operates outside safe limits Clipping is warned with REDGREEN blinks depending on LeftRight channel Sustained overcurrent will shut down the amplifier in order to avoid damage to speakers and warn the user with steady RED light A yellow light will warn the user that the temperature is reaching a level that is not healthy We have a Auto OFF function 3 hours without signal on the inputs will initiate a shutdown of the amplifier to conserve power and longevity of the product   There is a trigger input  All small signal levels are contained inside a well shielded small compartment in the back ensuring low noise and excellent RF protection The RF protection is done directly at the back of the fully shielded Neutrik XLR inputs The XLR inputs are directly connected to the chassis to ensure short signal patc to ground Remote sensing of the amplifier feedback loop at the speaker terminals using a four wire system ensures the lowest possible output impedance and distortion at the terminalsHere is a picture of the internal layout Note that this is seen from the bottom with the bottom lid off
