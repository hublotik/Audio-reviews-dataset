At higher 50W level 8 ohms residual distortion primarily thirdharmonic though 00045 probably academic interest Lowering load impedance 2 ohms keeping output voltage constant resulting 200W dissipation load brought level secondharmonic distortion shown fig5 Fig4 Mark Levinson No33H 1kHz waveform 50W 8 ohms distortion noise waveform fundamental notched Fig5 Mark Levinson No33H 1kHz waveform 200W 2 ohms distortion noise waveform fundamental notched The mainly thirdharmonic nature No33Hs distortion also seen fig6 spectral analysis amplifiers output drives lowfrequency sinewave twothirds nominal output power 4 ohms The significant distortion component third harmonic 150Hz low 80dB A powersupply artifact seen 180Hz 100dB The highlevel highfrequency intermodulation plot also clean 1kHz difference component lying 95dB 18kHz 21kHz components still better 80dB peak level Fig6 Mark Levinson No33H spectrum 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz 200W 4 ohms Fig7 Mark Levinson No33H HF intermodulation spectrum DC22kHz 1920kHz 25V 4 ohms Finally big Levinson powerhouse amplifier comfortably exceeding rated power Specified 150W 8 ohms actually didnt clip load 265W And wall AC supply 1145V starting droopâ€”this means dedicated 30A line amplifier probably put 300W 8 ohms Fig8 Mark Levinson No33H distortion vs output power 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Into 4 ohms maximum output power almost doubled 500W 2 ohms 900W available As dont dummy 1 ohm resistive load capable sinking almost 2kW Mark Levinson presumably capable putting load I wasnt able check clipping power 1 ohms However fractional decibel drop dBW time load halved suggests amplifier behaves almost perfect voltage source
