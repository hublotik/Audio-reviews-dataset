0, At a higher 50W level into 8 ohms the residual distortion  was primarily thirdharmonic though at 00045 this is probably of academic interest only Lowering the load impedance to 2 ohms and keeping the output voltage constant resulting in 200W dissipation in the load brought up the level of secondharmonic distortion as is shown in fig5 Fig4 Mark Levinson No33H 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  Fig5 Mark Levinson No33H 1kHz waveform at 200W into 2 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  The mainly thirdharmonic nature of the No33Hs distortion can also be seen in fig6 a spectral analysis of the amplifiers output while it drives a lowfrequency sinewave  at twothirds its nominal output power into 4 ohms The only significant distortion component is the third harmonic at 150Hz this a low 80dB  A powersupply artifact can just be seen at 180Hz but this is 100dB down The highlevel highfrequency intermodulation plot  was also very clean the 1kHz difference component lying at 95dB  and the 18kHz and 21kHz components still better than 80dB down from peak level Fig6 Mark Levinson No33H spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms  Fig7 Mark Levinson No33H HF intermodulation spectrum DC22kHz 1920kHz at 25V into 4 ohms  Finally the big Levinson is a powerhouse of an amplifier comfortably exceeding its rated power Specified at 150W into 8 ohms it actually didnt clip  into that load until 265W  And the wall AC supply at 1145V was starting to droopâ€”this means that with its own dedicated 30A line this amplifier will probably put out 300W into 8 ohms Fig8 Mark Levinson No33H distortion  vs output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms and 2 ohms Into 4 ohms the maximum output power almost doubled to 500W  into 2 ohms 900W was available   As we dont have a dummy 1 ohm resistive load capable of sinking the almost 2kW that the Mark Levinson is presumably capable of putting out into this load I wasnt able to check its clipping power into 1 ohms However the fractional decibel drop in dBW each time the load is halved suggests that this amplifier behaves as an almost perfect voltage source
