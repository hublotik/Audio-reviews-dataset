0, on an amplifier I precondition it by running both channels for 60 minutes at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB orAB output stage At the end of that hour the Krell FBIs entire chassis—not just the large vertical heatsinks on its sides—was too hot to touch This is an amplifier that needs plenty of ventilation The THDnoise percentage with the amplifier stone cold was 00142 by the end of the hours warmup this had dropped to 00067Without a signal generator having a currentsource output I couldnt perform any tests using the FBIs currentmode  input instead I used its conventional balanced and unbalanced inputs Looking first at the preamplifier outputs these offered a sensible maximum gain of 4dB for an unbalanced signal sourced from a constant 100 ohms across the audioband The FBI as a whole offered a maximum gain of 364dB into 8 ohms with both balanced and unbalanced sources which is as specified but lower than usual for an integrated amplifier The input impedance was extremely high across most of the audioband at 200k ohms unbalanced and 400k ohms balanced these figures dropping slightly but inconsequentially at 20kHz  All inputs preserved absolute polarity ie were noninvertingThe output impedance  was very low at 008 ohm at low and midrange frequencies It rose very slightly to 011 ohm at 20kHz but this will be inconsequential The modification of the amplifiers frequency response due to the interaction between its source impedance and the modulus of the speakers impedance was less than ±005dB  This graph also shows that the smallsignal audioband response is flat with a sensible ultrasonic rolloff reaching –3dB at 122kHz This bandwidth was identical with both balanced and unbalanced sources and didnt change with the volumecontrol setting The FBIs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured very short risetimes and was commendably free from overshoot and ringing  The 1kHz squarewave  was perfectly er squareFig1 Krell FBI frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 4 2 ohms Fig2 Krell FBI smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was very good at better than 96dB below 1kHz though it did decrease 76dB at 20kHz due to the usual capacitive coupling The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum was a good 765dB ref 283V into 8 ohms this improving to 871dB when Aweighted which is close to the specified 108dBA ref clipping power when you add the amplifiers voltage gain to the 283V figureThe FBI is specified as being able to deliver 300Wpc into 8 ohms  However plotting the output power against the THDN percentage  shows that the FBI actually delivered 430Wpc into 8 ohms at 1 THD which is a significant 16dBW higher With both channels driven the amplifier clipped at 667W into 4 ohms  Even though the clipping power with one channel driven into 2 ohms was 1020W  slightly below the specified 1200W I dont keep my AC wall voltage consistent for this test which had drooped with the amplifiers current draw The FBI will deliver all the power anyone could needFig3 Krell FBI distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsNote from fig3 that the THD level above a handful of watts into the lower impedances is higher than into 8 ohms This can also be seen in fig4 which plots the THDN percentage against frequency at 8V a level where the actual distortion is about to emerge from the background noise The THD doubles with each halving of the load impedance though in absolute terms it does remain low overall There is only a small rise in the top two octaves of the graph suggesting that the Krell FBI has a commendably wide openloop bandwidthFig4 Krell FBI THDN vs frequency at 8V into  8 4 2 ohms At moderate power levels into 8 ohms  the distortions harmonic content is almost pure third harmonic which will be subjectively innocuous Even at onethird the clipping power  only the third harmonic is evident However not only does the third harmonic rise when the load impedance is reduced the fifth and seventh harmonics appear  though its fair to say that these remain low in absolute terms And even with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones close to clipping into 4 ohms intermodulation distortion remains very low Fig5 Krell FBI 1kHz waveform at 13W into 8 ohms  000975 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 Krell FBI spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 120W into 8 ohms Fig7 Krell FBI spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 234W into 4 ohms Fig8 Krell FBI HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 550W peak into 4 ohms It was a pleasure to measure such a wellengineered amplifier as Krells FBI Quiet powerful stable and wellbehaved even into low impedances it is a paradigm of what an integrated amplifier needs to do If only it werent quite so heavy—carrying it down the steps of Freds brownstone to my car then down the stairs from my driveway to my test lab I began to appreciate the virtues of amps with featherweight classD output stages
