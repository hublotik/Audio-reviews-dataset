Benchmark AHB2 Amplifier using THX technology reduce distortion I going request one testing due membership demand pleasant surprise company volunteered contact send one two units I requested second one something I seeing measurements turned issue amps The AHB2 retails US 2999 company directThe AHB2 compact form factor enabled use switching power supply increase efficiencydensityThere power switch front It might I constantly reached screw next power Having power switch slightly different color shape may help thisThere set LEDs show status amplifier They driven FPGA monitors aspects amplifier shuts unit stressed It quickly efficiently testing Usually done purely analog maybe small microprocessor As coverage scenarios could damage amplifier much less complete using approach Benchmark using AHB2Here back panelThis minimalistic approach given small amount real estate available Only input XLR balanced fine book A gain switch allows input level controlled use RCA XLR adapter still get full power At extreme low gain setting designed professional preamps lots output getting max power 98 volts Using scheme signal noise ratio improved see measurements laterFor speaker terminals two sets classic heavy duty banana jacks SpeakOn The SpeakOn locking provide best performance I lost 3 dB performance using banana jacks due less secure connect So measurements see SpeakOn jacksAnother minor nit note I rather cheap SpeakOn cable plug large enough hit silver screws sockets mounted Typical round shaped SpeakOn ones issue Flush mount screws would solve problemThere switch selecting stereo mono bridged output The latter quadruples amount power available unlike typical bridging according Benchmark comes penalty distortion I plan test later minimum impedance 6 ohm I could use 4 ohm setup I used testingThere beefy AC mains cable really nice locking tabs Insert stays put unless push two red tabs side Nothing aggravating AC cable coming halfway lose IEC socketBeing proper company course AHB2 comes full set regulatorysafetyemissions certifications super important power amplifiers given high voltages currents running around themIn use AHB2 stays cool power amplifier idling outputting little power nice surpriseAs THX technology merges lowpower low distortion amplifier high power higher distortion amplifier The distortion latter seen producing much power The general scheme new dating back 1980s new implementation We seen stellar performance Massdrop THX AAA 789 amplifier broke new ground level distortion noise Will Benchmark AHB2 manage Lets seePower Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual I start 5 watt output test using 4 ohm load using SpeakOn terminals notedI hope jaw floor like mine I saw picture emerge 113 dB THDN power amplifier Are kidding meLook harmonic distortion The worst case spike 130 dB This insanely good Of course type SINAD crowns Benchmark AHB2 best I ever testedThe performance good I literally rebuild dummy load get Even quality metal used connectors matters get level distortion I replace dummy loads higher precision ones much less VCR Resistor values become voltage dependent creating distortions Up 105 dB THDN doesnt matter beyond VCR dominant distortion Benchmark AHB2 amplifierIt requested I show breakdown distortion areOur best case hearing threshold 116 dB SPL question level distortion totally inaudible Separating noise THD see noise measuring THDN rather distortionAnd exceptional noise performance Benchmark AHB2 see graph THDN versus powerEven high gain AHB2 easily outperforms DIY Hypex NC400 I tested used best amp I testedWe 185 watts power incredibly low distortion 000016 besting company specificationsNote FPGA protection mode kicks essentially shots amplifier past limit You get absolutely distortionless noiseless performance moreEDIT performance bridged mode using 4 ohm loadYou get 500 watts stunningly clean power Protection circuit shut unit quite safe try With THD essentially matching nonbridged mode reason afraid trying thisIntermodulation distortion versus power level shows story clean powerIf want know get extra money bargain amplifiers see difference graph We talking 5 10 dB whopping 40 dB betterI requests intermodulation distortion using dual 19 20 kHz tones Here thatTHDN versus output level looks far cleaner anything I tested beforeEven limit hearing vanishingly low amount distortion The graph exaggerated shows rise absolute levels despite 90 kHz bandwidth test incredibly low THDN 004The sharp spike 45 Hz green shows amplifier going protection mode So dont pump sine wave continuously 133 watts Frequency response exceptional expectedSince switching amplifier filter allowing bandwidth go 200 kHz beyond Lowest band AM radio 450 kHz likely could use AHB2 AM radio transmitter Usually test switching amplifiers see kind interesting things outputs hearing range The AHB2 classic configuration albeit switching power supply well clean hereMy reference graph Hypex NC400 used AES filter I ran AHB2 ways without filter Using filter two equal see much cleaner spectrum 200 kHz course massive switching spikes Worst case spike 115 dB In words Benchmark AHB2 clean even areas looking It like restaurant scrubbing parking lot soap pad well dishes My loose wires dummy loads best setup measuring crosstalk anywayWhere hearing sensitive separation around 100 dB way way need Despite small enclosure AHB2 manages exceptional numbers hereEDIT forgot run classic SNR test original reviewWow assuming play peak 120 dBSPL noise floor 10 dBSPL That absolute silenceConclusionsIt goes without saying Benchmark AHB2 breaks new ground respect performance power amplifiers Using assured distortion hear sources This I look highend audio absolutely best performance second guessing involved You buy happy foreverAll comes company model transparency proper accurate measurements products site And importantly volunteering data shown correct independent sources us Support form company least also exceptionalYes 3000 fair bit money pocket change highend audio Sales tax higher 3000 products I hear lot talk audiophiles equipment get way enjoying music Well Benchmark AHB2 levels assuredly passes full transparency So moto better stop buying boutique products specs independent measurements get AHB2 Everything hear source dirty dishes amp serve food onNeedless say Benchmark AHB2 gets strongest recommendation power amplifier The pink panther agrees hit ball park I took shot
