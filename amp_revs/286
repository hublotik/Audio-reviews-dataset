0, Crown XLS 1502 PA Power Amplifier It is on a kind loan from a member who bought it new and drop shipped it to me It retails for USD 349 including free Prime shipping from Amazon At that price it seems like an incredible valueI have to say while the unit looks industrialmilitary it does not at all feel cheap As expected it comes in 19 inch rack mount configuration but very shallowNot only do you get a high power amplifier with front graphical display and such but also a builtin DSP It is not a fancy subsystem but allows you to dial in crossovers and such which is very handy in live sound  At may company  we use a ton of Crown amps not for hifi applications but for music distribution in the home The builtin DSPs come in handy for limiting the frequency range max output etcUnlike home units the XLS 1502 has a builtin fan with tons of holes for ventilation as you see Fortunately it is temperature controlled and barely came on during my nearly 50 watt soak time And when it came on it was very quietHere are the guts of the unit Man is this clean Look at the beefy mains chokes to keep noise at bay The power supply is integrated on the same board as the power amplifier so you cant swap one to fix the unit although at these prices getting a new unit is more economical anyway The fan is placed not only in front of the heatsinks for the power transistors but also the output filter inductors which is nice as far as keeping them cool tooI noticed that the output stage is depopulated Seems then that the step up model just has a few more parts in it and that is thatThere are tons of connectors in the back which I let you read about elsewhere Overall this is jaw droppingly nice unit and unbelievable at the price that is being chargedI did a lot of searching and was surprised that there were no measurements of these units A lot of empty reviews yes But no measurements So you get to have an exclusive set of data in this review  So lets get into thatMeasurementsI started by cooking the unit for a while at 48 watts with kind permission from its ownerUnlike some other amps bringing the unit up to temp ever so slightly worsens performance There are also some interesting thermal effects from time to time represented by the spikes Anyone who thinks they can predict what thousands of components do as they warm up should get into predicting the weather on tuesday next week 10 years from now Anyway lets look at our dashboard at 5 watts of outputSorry I did not set the reference in the FFT But the news is there in the SINAD  of just 75 dB We have seen worse but also much much better Gain is about 30 dB by the waySignal to noise ratio is decent but again nothing highend about itLets look at power versus distortionnoiseSo we see that the Crown XLS 1502 easily outperforms the noname Chinese class D amp we recently tested  It has a well behaved response with sloping down curve and then onset of clipping Power was around 336 watts  0008 distortion I say around as there are not enough points in these measurements to find the exact onset of clipping The number is therefore a bit understated Crown specs the unit at 525 watts though at 4 ohm and we are not going to get there without a lot of distortionThe hypex Hyped DIY Nc400 amplifier far outperforms the XLS 1502 It has far lower noise and distortion although not as much power before clipping It costs nearly four times as much thoughI thought I do a comparison against the Behringer A500 The A500 feels a lot more cheaply made but is also priced at 199We see that the Crown XLS 1502 is better in every regard with lower noise and much more usable power before clippingI thought the continuous power would be a walk in the part for the XLS 1502 but did present a surpriseThe red thermal light came on the front panel but instead of shutting down the power was reduced a bit The show must go on seems to be the rule here and nice to see instead of full shutdown we saw with Hypex Nc400  As you see I let the unit keep going and it went to 8 minute maintaining that statusFrequency response was surprising but easily explainableWe have a brickwall style filter which indicates our analog input is digitized first through an ADC running at 48 kHz sampling processed through DSP  and then converted back to analog before amplification Both the ADC and DAC therefore sharply limit the bandwidth to 48 kHz I was surprised to see some roll off at 20 Hz tooWideband FFT  as usual shows a lot of activity in higher frequenciesThe first peak is very nicely truncated at a little less than 100 kHz to pass emissions standards  Crown class I devices interleave the output stages which would explain the energy spread over four quadrants at multiples of that 100 kHz pulses Since the XLS 1502 has passed emissions standards I would not worry too much about themConclusionsIt is hard to fathom that a properly engineered and produced mainstream brand amplifier with so much power can be sold for so little money This is a robust but bargain amplifier designed for heavy punishment in live sound Can it be used for hifi use Sure but it will severely limit both the resolution and potentially bandwidth of upstream sources Its best use would be as a subwoofer amplifier If you need an all in one unit Hypex NC400NC500 designs are so far my choice among amplifiers tested
