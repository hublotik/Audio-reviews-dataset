0, Ashly NE8250 professional 8channel networked power amplifier   costs US 2386The look and controls are fine It is going in a rack after all Note that back connections are all phoenix blocksYou can make your own cables or buy adapters  There is a nice network UI interface and appAshly NE8250 MeasurementsAll measurements are from channels 3 and 4 Lets start with our dashboardThat is huge amount of harmonic distortion placing the amp almost at the bottom of our SINAD listStrangely in a good way noise floor is lowFrequency response droops at either end but surprisingly it is not load dependent despite being Class D designCrosstalk is fineMultitone shows poor performance that we would expectYou buy these amps for power so lets see how it does at 4 ohmOuch That distortion curve is crazy It almost act like a tube amp or something Distortion is so high when it clips that when we measure at 1 we actually get less powerSwitching to 8 ohm doesnt helpSweeping the frequencies we see this pronounced humpSo my guess is that it is a class G design but company says Class DConclusionsThe distortion in this amplifier is just out of control It is also not every powerful on a per channel basis So I dont see it having a good application for home use in either main or sub amplifier It is also expensive so I dont see the value in it either Then again the owner said they come up much cheaper on ebay so maybe that would be some motivation to buy itI cant recommend the Ashly NE8250 Your ears deserve better Edit video review posted
