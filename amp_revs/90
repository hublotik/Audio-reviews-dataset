0, Constellation Inspiration Stereo 10   s I ran it at onethird its specified clipping power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time both the top panel and the perforated side panels were warm at 1064°F  the gain at the speaker terminals was 251dB for both the balanced and singleended inputs—slightly below the specified 26dB and the output inverted absolute polarity with both inputsThe Constellation amplifiers input impedance at low and middle frequencies was extremely high at 1M ohm balanced and 310k ohms unbalanced  The impedances dropped to a stillhigh 690k and 130k ohms respectively at the top of the audioband I was puzzled by this as the specified impedances are 20k ohms balanced and 10k ohms unbalanced Perhaps the circuit was changed after the specifications were published but a very high input impedance is in no way a problemThe output impedance was low varying from 011 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz to 012 ohm at 20kHz Measured into our standard simulated loudspeaker the Inspirations frequency response varied by only ±01dB  Fig1 also shows that the response was flat to 20kHz with all load impedances but that the ultrasonic output increasingly rolled off above 20kHz as the load impedance dropped Into 8 ohms  the output was down by just 13dB at 200kHz a 10kHz squarewave in to that load was therefore reproduced with very short risetimes  though a slight hint of overshoot was present on the waveforms leading edgesFig1 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 10 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Constellation

also very quiet its unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 283V into 8 ohms and assessed with the unbalanced input shorted to ground measuring a superb 88dB  Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved the ratio to 952dB and Aweighting the measurement further improved it to 981dB Spectral analysis of the Stereo 10s lowfrequency noise floor  indicated that while some spuriae were present at the AC supply frequency and its harmonics these were all at or below –105dB in the left channel  and mostly lower than that in the right channel Fig3 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 10 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Inspiration Stereo 10 is specified as delivering 200Wpc into 8 ohms or 400Wpc into 4 ohms  at 1 THDnoise Figs 4 and 5 respectively plot its percentage of THDN against power into 8 and 4 ohms and reveal that at 1 THDN with both channels driven the amplifier delivers more power than specified 340W into 8 ohms  and 480W into 4 ohms  I tried repeating this test into 2 ohms with just the left channel but the Stereo 10 turned itself off before the THDN reached 1 When I turned it back on only the right channel was operating which suggests that one of the internal highvoltage fuses had blown I could see no way to get inside the chassis to replace the fuse and the manual strongly advises leaving fuse replacement to the dealerFig4

had by then performed almost all of my tests other than examining how the Constellations THDN percentage varied with frequency I thus performed that test with just the right channel operating  and at a level high enough that I could be certain I was examining distortion rather than noise 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms Fig6 reveals that the Constellation offered very low distortion into 8 ohms  slightly higher distortion into 4 ohms  but about 10 times as much THDN into 2 ohms  There is the usual rise in THDN in the top two audio octaves but still only to levels that are respectably low As well as being very low in level the distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  though at very high powers into 4 ohms the third harmonic is joined by lower levels of second and fifth harmonics  Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with the peak signal level reaching 200W into 4 ohms the increase in THDN seen in the top octaves in fig6 results in quite a few intermodulation products —but of these the highest in level are still at only –86dB  and the potentially audible product at 1kHz lies almost 100dB downFig6 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 10 right channel THDN  vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 10 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00029

than its conservative specification claims
