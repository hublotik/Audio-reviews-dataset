0, Carver Crimson 275 tube stereo power amplifier It was purchased new by member paulbottlehead and given to me for testing It costs US 2750I really like the way the amplifier looks The burgundy color is attractive as is the handle On the latter the unit is very light though so the handle while handy is not necessary to lift the thing Back panel shows high quality connectorsThe tubes four Tunsol KT120 pair of 12AT7W and 12AX7 can in their original boxes for the owner installation Went to open one of the small tube boxes but found nothing in it Worried I looked around and it had come out of its box and was just floating in the larger box that they all came inPrior to installation of tubes I had something to investigate there was clearly something loose in there rattling around So I took the back panel off to find a metal screw rolling around in thereNot sure where it was supposed to go There is a hole for something above the second fuse from the bottom but I think that would for a nutI did not like lack of safety  ground from the IEC terminalInstead there is some kind of local star grounding referenced to neutral using a resistor That naturally wont work for safety purposes With that power supply board mounted vertically with voltages as high as 300 volts I sure as heck would want this metal case grounded I dont care what audioelectrical problem they were trying to solve there I want a safe product first and foremost Naturally there is no safetyregulatory certification which I expect a company with the name Carver to be able to affordI got a kick out of the beefy speaker terminals but ultrathin wires leading to it Yes the lengths are short and at this wattage is probably fine but from optics point of view you would want to use something better than hair thin wiring I was sad to see the VU meter glued to the caseI realize welding a couple of threaded standoffs to the case costs money but at this price I expect such The meter is not backlit which was another disappointment But was useful for checking bias which was right at the spec at 100 milliampsSo nice looks but under the skin a number of concernsCarver Crimson 275 MeasurementsI usually let amplifiers warm up some and watch their behavior and also let things stabilize before measurements Manual states that bias can be checked after 20 minutes so I let it run for that long and a bit moreNote that the vertical scale is only 3 dB so dont be alarmed by the variations Generally speaking unit is table after a couple of minutes of warm up But it is fascinating to see performance gradually get worse as it kept warming up So next comes our usual dashboard My Audio Precision analyzer by default has floating  RCA terminals But I had to override that by grounding it as I observed oscillations  No other attempt at grounding made a difference in power supplymains humThe power supply noise really dirties up the FFT spectrum but looking past that we see that the low SINAD  is dominated by distortion Unlike the common reputation for tubes distortion is third harmonic for the most part not second Naturally the high level of distortion places the 275 very low in our scale second only to one other amp ever testedCompany spec is quite good for noise level relative to full power I could not get that without aweightingBut applying the aweighting filter and with it getting rid of power supply noise we do essentially get thereCrosstalk was poorFrequency response has an odd shape and good bit of loss at high frequencies with 4 ohm loadOutput impedance is high enough that is combining with the load to change the high frequency roll off Things get better as such with an 8 ohm loadThere is an RC filter on the speaker terminals Wonder if that is what is providing the roll offUsing 32 tones to simulate music we see a high level of grass which would obscure any low level detailNotice how the worse performance is in low frequenciesThere has been controversy regarding ability of the 275 to produce its rated power of 75 watts so lets start with 4 ohm load as I usually doThe amplifier produced 29 watts after which it blew its 3 amp mains fuse Fortunately two spares were provided allowing me to continue testing Company specs distortion at less than 1 so lets see power at that ratingVery dramatic difference between 1 or 2 second power  vs short bursts There is clearly a capacity problem to produce sustained power Note that this is at 1 kHz as is industry convention Note that allowing just 1 THD reduces the power even more than what I allowed in my power sweepI was surprised to not see selectable output impedance for 8 ohm load so proceed with the test as isWe blew the second fuse but now power is much more healthy at 60 wattsHoping to not blow the last fuse I kept the max power level lower as I changed frequenciesPerformance was reasonable  but once we got down to 20 Hz it became super erratic and blew the third fuse  It produced only 14 wats which is well short of 30 watts it produced at higher frequencies I would have wanted to test at more frequencies but it was past midnight and I did not feel like hunting around to find my own replacement fusesConclusionsAs a Carver owner of 40 years  I have a soft spot for the designer Alas while I like some things about this amp like the nice looking paint I am very disappointed in the QC and construction of the unit with respect to safety Loose screws and glued meters should not be part of a nears 3000 amplifier Measured performance is awful of course and one would expect that for many audiophile tube amps But having third harmonic be dominant blows away the story of why that is audibly a good thing Clearly the specifications of the amplifier is incorrect for 4 ohm load  And low frequency behavior is very poorUnless you are going to buy the Carver Crimson 275 to just look at it I cant recommend it for many reasons stated above I expect more from the man the legendPS It was nice to take a break from drying up our flooded home and get back to some normalcy with testing this amp It cheered me up to be working again and doing what I enjoyEDIT We have had two formal responses from Bob CarverCarver Crimson 275 Review What baffles me is that to make this amp safe and hum free doesnâ€™t take much effort They are taking a lazy design approach Not counting total disrespect to their customers by disregarding their safetywwwaudiosciencereviewcomCarver Crimson 275 Review This was addressed in the first thread Yes both Amir and I have done the measurements with the negative speaker terminal floating Thank youwwwaudiosciencereviewcomAnd one from Wyred4Sound that manufactures the unitCarver Crimson 275 Review I think its pretty clear that Mr Carver is keeping a controlled distance from BCC and if push came to shove would say hey yes its my design but I have no idea what they have done with it since I sold the company you would need to check with them If

enjoywwwaudiosciencereviewcomCarver Crimson 275 Review After the first fuse blew I would have searched around for a slowblow maybe even 4A just for testing The manual repeatedly says to not use slow
