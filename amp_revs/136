0, Verity Monsalvat Amp60   The Amp60 has no heatsinks per se instead its massive aluminum chassis dissipates heat  I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone for an hour at onethird power into 8 ohms which is the most thermally stressful condition for an amplifier with a classAB output stage At the end of that time the Veritys top panel was relatively cool at 793°F  its side panels were only a little warmer at 921°F The voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 317dB for both balanced and unbalanced signals which is almost 5dB higher than the norm Both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  the XLR jacks being wired with pin 2 hot The unbalanced input impedance was on the low side at 91k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 86k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was 20k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHzThe output impedance including a 6long spacedpair speaker cable was a moderate 018 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 025 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was ±02dB  The Monsalvats frequency response into 8 ohms was down by just 03dB at 100kHz  as a result a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with very short risetimes  with just a slight hint of overshoot A 1kHz squarewave was perfectly square  Fig1 reveals that the ultrasonic output rolls off earlier with lower impedances with the response into 2 ohms  down by 09dB at 20kHz Channel separation measured using the balanced input was 70dB in both directions in the midrange and below decreasing to 62dB at the top of the audiobandFig1 Verity Monsalvat Amp60 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Verity Monsalvat Amp60 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe signalnoise ratios taken with the inputs shorted to ground and ref 1W into 8 ohms were different for balanced and unbalanced operation The unbalanced unweighted wideband ratio was an extremely high 915dB in the left channel and 883dB in the right These ratios respectively improved to a superb 1021 and 1011dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit The balanced ratios however were all lower the Aweighted figures being 786dB for the left channel 828dB for the rightSpectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor with unbalanced drive  indicated that there were AC powersupply–related harmonics at 60Hz and both its oddorder harmonics  and its evenorder harmonics  Other than the spectral component at 60Hz which was at a stillverylow –94dB  these spuriae all lay at or below –107dB  and the random noisefloor components were all extremely low However when I repeated the analysis with the balanced inputs all of the supplyrelated harmonics rose by around 20dB which is why the balanced SN ratios werent as good as the unbalanced ratios This is unusual—balanced operation tends to have lower noise due to the circuits commonmode noise rejectionFig3 Verity Monsalvat Amp60 unbalanced drive spectrum DC–1kHz ref 1W into 8 ohms The Monsalvat Amp60s output is specified as 60Wpc into 8 ohms and 120Wpc into 4 ohms  and 180Wpc into 2 ohms  Our review sample exceeded these specifications into 8 and 4 ohms With clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1 and with both of the Amp60s channels driven I measured clipping powers of 95Wpc into 8 ohms  and 145Wpc into 4 ohms  I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests it measured 1198V AC at the measured clipping power However when I tried to measure the maximum output power into 2 ohms with only the left channel driven the Amp60 clipped at just 50W  I repeated the test this time with only the right channel driven and got the same resultFig4 Verity Monsalvat

continuous output power into 2 ohmsI examined how the Verity amplifiers percentage of THDN varied with frequency at 10V which is equivalent to 125W into 8 ohms and 25W into 4 ohms The percentage of THDN was low in the bass and midrange  with the right channel  more linear than the left  While there was the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in openloop voltage gain as the frequency increased this was by only a small amountFig7 Verity Monsalvat Amp60 THDN  vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The left channels THDN waveform at 30Wpc into 8 ohms  indicates that the distortion was low at 0013 and had strong secondharmonic content though with spuriae also occurring at the zero crossing points With a lowfrequency tone at 50Wpc into 8 ohms the second harmonic was indeed the highest in level in the left channel at –78dB  The second harmonic was lower in the right channel at –87dB  and the third harmonic is now the highest in level at –80dB  There are some higherorder harmonics present as well as supplyrelated spuriae but these all lie below –100dB  Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones the Amp60 produced relatively low levels of intermodulation distortion even at high powers into low impedances  The difference product at 1kHz lay at –77dB in the left channel  and at –90dB in the right  The higherorder products were all at or below –80dB Fig8 Verity

Fig10 Verity Monsalvat Amp60 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 4 ohms The Verity Monsalvat Amp60s measured performance is generally respectable However I was bothered by the difference in SN ratios between the balanced and singleended inputs and by the shortfall in measured power into 2 ohms
