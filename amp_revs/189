0, darTZeel NHB458 I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  I ran it at 13 its rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage At the end of that period while the shrouded heatsink on the amplifiers rear was too hot to keep my hand on at 635°C146°F the top of the enclosure was only warm at 408°C1074°F according to my infrared thermometer The THDnoise with the amplifier stone cold was 008 after an hour with the amplifier hot it had risen slightly to 0083—a much smaller change than I have found with some other solidstate amplifiersI wasnt able to test the NHB458 through its impedancematched 50ohm Zeel input I measured its performance using the conventional unbalanced and balanced inputs selecting each with the frontpanel Menu buttons  As used by Michael Fremer the amplifiers gain was set to 32dB via the unbalanced input the voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 3205dB The balanced inputs gain was 6dB lower Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  the XLR being wired with pin 2 hotThe unbalanced input impedance specified as being 30k ohms was a usefully high 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping inconsequentially to 37k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was 20k ohms at all frequencies as specified The output impedance was high for a solidstate design at 03 ohm  at all frequencies Consequently there was a slight ±025dB variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  due to the Ohms Law interaction between this impedance and that of the load The NHB458s smallsignal frequency was otherwise flat within the audioband with all impedances above 2 ohms the bandwidth into 8 ohms was wide the response being down by 1dB at 200kHz  As a result the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured very short risetimes  with no trace of overshoot or ringing Good stuffFig1 darTZeel NHB458 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  The darTZeel amplifier was quiet the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  measuring 814dB with the RCA input jack shorted to ground Switching an Aweighting filter into circuit increased the ratio to 924dB as the noise predominantly comprised low levels of the 60Hz AC supply frequency  perhaps partly due to magnetic interference from the massive toroidal transformer that is the amplifiers heartFig2 darTZeel NHB458 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 darTZeel NHB458 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Figs 4 5 and 6 show how the THDN percentage changes with output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms respectively taken from the unbalanced input This is a powerful amplifier Defining the clipping point as the power when the THDN reaches 1 the NHB458 clips at 530W into 8 ohms  900W into 4 ohms  and 1025W into 2 ohms   Usually with a solidstate amplifier the shapes of the traces in figs 4 5 and 6 would indicate that the THDN reading was dominated by noise at low powers with the actual distortion rising out of the noise floor at each traces inflection point But the NHB458 is a very quiet amplifier and these traces reveal that the distortion is very unusually higher at lower powers than at higher powers at least until the amplifier starts to clip I would have suspected crossover distortion due to a lack of outputstage bias current except that crossover distortion comprises subjectively irritating highorder harmonics—and as you will see the NHB458s distortion spectrum is dominated by loworder harmonicsFig4 darTZeel NHB458 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 darTZeel NHB458 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 darTZeel NHB458 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsTo ensure that noise didnt affect the measurement I examined how the darTZeels THDN percentage changed with frequency at a fairly high voltage 1267V  The results are shown in fig7 while the THD roughly doubles with each halving of the load impedance it remains constant at all frequencies which is something I conjecture correlates with good sound quality provided the spectrum of the distortion consists of loworder harmonics Which the NHB458s distortion spectrum does Fig8 indicates that it primarily consists of the subjectively innocuous second and third harmonics This graph was taken at a low power at high powers higherorder harmonics can be seen  though the spectrum doesnt change significantly when a 4 ohm load  is substituted for 8 ohms  other than an increase in the third harmonic Despite the higherthanusual harmonic distortion the NHB458 did relatively well on the highpower highfrequency intermodulation test  While the difference component at 1kHz lies at –64dB  all the higherorder intermodulation products lie below that levelFig7 darTZeel NHB458 THDN  vs frequency at 1267V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8

into 4 ohms  Fig10 darTZeel NHB458 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms Its measured performance reveals that darTZeels NHB458 offers extremely wide dynamic range capability While its distortion is not as low as is usually found in modern solidstate designs perhaps of greater importance is the fact that that distortion comprises loworder harmonics and that the distortion doesnt change its harmonic character with frequency
