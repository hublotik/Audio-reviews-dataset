0,  I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before doing the testing I ran the Musical Fidelity AMS100 at onethird its rated power for 60 minutes which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage However an amplifier with a classA output stage runs cooler when under load At the end of that period the chassis was warm with a temperature of 104°F  though the heatsinks were hotter at 116°F  Without any signal fed to the amplifier the heatsink temperature slowly rose to 120°F  The AMS100 is not an amplifier you can hide in a closet—even if you have a closet big enoughThe voltage gain was the same for both balanced and unbalanced inputs at 299dB which is 3dB higher than the US norm Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  the XLRs being wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance was close to specification at low and middle frequencies at 48k ohms unbalanced and balanced for each leg but dropped at 20kHz to 39k ohms balanced and 17k ohms unbalancedThe AMS100s output impedance  was low across most of the audioband at 008 ohm However this rose to 022 ohm at 20kHz which restricts the amplifiers bandwidth into lower impedances While the smallsignal frequency response is down by just 017dB at 20kHz and by 3dB at 170kHz  it is –05dB at 20kHz into 4 ohms  and –09dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  However the variation of the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was minimal at ±01dB  The wide bandwidth into 8 ohms gives rise to a wellformed 10kHz squarewave with neither overshoot nor ringing evident  The 1kHz squarewave  was equally wellformedFig1 Musical Fidelity AMS100 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Musical Fidelity AMS100 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Musical Fidelity AMS100 smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was excellent at 100dB below 800Hz in both directions and was still 80dB at 20kHz The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was not as good as I was expecting from a classA design at 768dB left and 753dB right both figures ref 1W into 8 ohms Aweighting improved the ratios to a respectable 892 and 9075dB respectively Fig4 reveals that the AMS100s lowfrequency noise floor has some supplyrelated spuriae the tones at 120 and 240Hz stem from the fullwave supply and are a little higher in the right channel than the left those at 60 and 180Hz and higher may well be due to magnetic leakage from the massive power transformers into the chokes used to smooth the DC voltage rails Nevertheless all these spuriae lie at better than –120dB ref maximum power and so should be inaudibleFig4 Musical Fidelity AMS100 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Figs5 6 and 7 plot the percentage of THDnoise in the Musical Fidelitys output against output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms respectively We define clipping as the power level at which the THDN reaches 1 these graphs confirm that the AMS100 meets its 100Wpc  specification into 8 ohms but clips at 185Wpc into 4 ohms  It also clips at 295Wpc into 2 ohms  I dont hold the wall voltage constant for these tests it was 1202V AC with the amplifier quiescent dropping slightly to 1201V at clipping into 4 ohms with both channels driven or into 2 ohms with one channel driven The downward slope of the traces in these graphs suggests that the actual distortion is buried under the noise floor right up to the point where the waveform begins to square so I plotted how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 20V output which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The results are shown in fig8—the distortion is very low at 0001 at low and middle frequencies into the higher impedances but it does rise above 1kHz due to the usual reduction in negative feedback that results from the circuits restricted openloop bandwidth Even so it is still just 0011 at 20kHzFig5 Musical Fidelity AMS100

output power into 2 ohmsFig8 Musical Fidelity AMS100 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms I averaged 64 readings to examine the waveform of the THDN spuriae but even then what appears to be mainly thirdharmonic distortion is overlaid with noise  FFT analysis  confirms that the subjectively innocuous third harmonic is predominant—if anything at –106dB  can be called predominant Highfrequency intermodulation distortion at the same peak signal level was also very low  though it did begin to rise with even a small increase in power  or decrease in load impedanceFig9 Musical

ohms Like other Musical Fidelity power amplifiers the AMS100 offers excellent measured performance especially very low static distortion But the use of classA bias for its output stage means that its impressive bulk conceals power delivery that is relatively modest when compared to that of its siblings
