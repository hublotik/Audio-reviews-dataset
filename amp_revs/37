0, PS Audio Stellar M700   s of an amplifier I usually precondition it by running it at onethird the clipping power into 8 ohms for an hour As the Stellar M700 has a classD output stage this was not necessary But I did take the temperature of its case the top panel was slightly warm at 80°F  The voltage gain into 8 ohms was 305dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs and the M700 preserved absolute polarity  for both inputs meaning that the XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hotThe unbalanced input impedance was close to the specified 50k ohms measuring 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies and dropping inconsequentially to 35k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced impedance as expected The output impedance  was low at 01 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz However the output impedance was actually negative at the top of the audioband perhaps due to the behavior of the necessary lowpass filter The action of this filter can be seen in fig1 which rolls off the output very sharply above 50kHz with the actual frequency of the response knee dependent on the load impedance The variation in frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker was small at less than ±01dB  but there is an implication of an ultrasonic resonance developing with loads of higher impedance This gave rise to a small degree of overshoot and one cycle of damped ringing with a 10kHz squarewave Fig1 PS Audio Stellar M700 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 PS Audio Stellar M700 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with AP AUX0025 lowpass filterAs the M700 is a classD design all  with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz that might otherwise overload the SYS2722s input circuitry Without the filter 877mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the speaker terminals with a center frequency of 465kHz  This noise can be seen riding on the waveform of a 1kHz sinewave when I didnt use the filter  With the Audio Precision filter the Stellar M700 produced relatively low levels of noise in the audioband with no trace of ACsupply harmonics  The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was 66dB improving to a respectable 817dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 84dB when AweightedFig3 PS Audio Stellar M700 smallsignal 1kHz waveform into 8 ohms without AP AUX0025 lowpass filterFig4 PS Audio Stellar M700 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms We define clipping as when the percentage of THDnoise in the amplifiers output reaches 1 and fig5 indicates that the M700 slightly exceeds its specified power of 350W into 8 ohms  Into 4 ohms  the M700 clips at precisely the specified 700W  Fig7 plots the THDN percentage against frequency at a level at which I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THD is very low at low and middle frequencies into 8 and 4 ohms but does rise into 2 ohms and at high frequencies The distortion signature primarily comprises the relatively benign third harmonic  and lies at just –80dB  even at 200W into 4 ohms  Intermodulation distortion at the same high power was also very low Fig5 PS Audio Stellar M700 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 PS Audio Stellar M700 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 PS Audio Stellar M700 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8 PS Audio Stellar M700 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms 00063 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 PS Audio Stellar M700 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms Fig10 PS Audio Stellar M700 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms PS Audios Stellar M700 packs a lot of power into a small coolrunning case and offers respectable measured performance
