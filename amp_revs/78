0, Creek Evolution 50A using Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system   on an amplifier I run it for an hour with both channels driven at 13 its rated power into 8 ohms this is the level at which the maximum amount of power is dissipated in the output devices with a classAB topology However when I tried this with the Creek Evolution 50A the amplifier turned itself off after 20 minutes its frontpanel display showing the message OVERHEATED An infrared thermometer indicated that the internal heatsinks visible through slots in the top panel were at 1409°F  Thermally 13 power is very much the worst case for a classAB amplifier but it looks as if the Creeks price has been kept affordable by using undersize heatsinks This probably wont be a problem with normal use but the amplifier might go quiet if used to supply continuous loud music at a party I let the 50A cool down and was then able to continue with the testingThe maximum gain at 1kHz into 4 ohms was 325dB with a singleended signal but surprisingly 6dB lower than that with a balanced signal fed to line input 4 The Evolution 50A preserved absolute polarity  with both singleended and balanced signals the latter suggesting that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance was constant with frequency at just under 11k ohms singleended and 42k ohms balancedThe output impedance at low and middle frequencies including 6 of speaker cable was very low at 0096 ohm rising very slightly to 0113 ohm at 20kHz As a result of this low impedance the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the way in which our simulated loudspeakers impedance changes with frequency was minimal  The traces in this graph which was taken with the volume control at its maximum  and a balanced signal show that the Creek has a very wide bandwidth –2dB at 100kHz as specified This correlates with the very short risetimes seen in the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  which is commendably free from overshoot or ringing The shape of a 1kHz squarewave was essentially perfect  The frequency response remained the same at lower settings of the volume control which operated in accurate 1dB stepsFig1 Creek Evolution 50A balanced input volume control at 0dB frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Creek Evolution 50A smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Creek Evolution 50A smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Treble and Bass controls offer a nominal 10dB of maximum boost and cut However fig4 indicates that the swing is closer to ±13dB below 40Hz and 11–12dB above 10kHz Channel separation  was good rather than great at 70dB L–R and 80dB R–L below 2kHzFig4 Creek Evolution 50A frequency response at 1V into 8 ohms with Treble and Bass controls set to 10  –10  0  The Evolution 50A was a quiet amplifier I test an integrated amplifiers signalnoise ratio with the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum which is very much the worstcase situation The unweighted wideband ratio ref 283V into 8 ohms was good at 694dB left and 702dB right improving to 846 and 849dB respectively when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband Switching an Aweighting filter into circuit gave a further 3dB improvement in the measured ratiosThe Evolution 50A is specified as having a maximum power output of 55W into 8 ohms or 85W into 4 ohms Figs5 and 6 show that the THDnoise reaches 1 our usual definition of clipping at 63W into 8 ohms  and 96W into 4 ohms  The downward slope below 20W or so of the traces in these graphs suggests that any distortion harmonics are buried beneath the noise floor until a few dB below clipping I therefore examined how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at a level 1265V equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms or 40W into 4 ohms where I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise The result is shown in fig7 the Evolution 50A offers very low levels of distortion in the bass and midrange with the rise in THD in the treble due to the decreasing effectiveness of negative feedback as the frequency risesFig5 Creek Evolution 50A distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Creek Evolution 50A distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 Creek Evolution 50A THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Despite the low level of THD the distortion waveform  has spikes visible at the sinewaves zerocrossing points suggesting a low level of outputstage bias current These spikes are associated with a picket fence of highorder distortion components  which will be more audible than might be thought the case from their very low levelsFig8 Creek

Finally despite the decreasing circuit linearity at high frequencies the Evolution 50A produced relatively low levels of intermodulation products when fed an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible clipping on an oscilloscope screen  However the 1kHz difference product is about 12dB higher in level in the left channel  than in the right Fig10 Creek Evolution 50A HF
