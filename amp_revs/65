0,Usually when I measure an amplification or digital product I carry the box down the stairs to my basement where I have my listening room and test lab However the Accustic Arts AMP V was too heavy for me to do this Instead I rolled it in its wheeled flightcase into the vestibule outside the listening room removed the flightcase cover and left the amplifier sitting in the flightcase  at the top of the small flight of stairs I then set up my  system  with its dedicated PC my analog and digital oscilloscopes test loads etc at the foot of the stairs The amplifiers two AC leads were plugged into the closest wall socket along with those for the test system Before I performed the testing  amplifier by running it at oneeighth its specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes as recommended by the CEA After the preconditioning the heatsinks on the amplifiers sides were hot at 1134°F  The top panel was warm at 1050°F Soon after I began the testing—after the preconditioning period—the 15A circuit breaker serving the wall socket into which everything was plugged tripped  I therefore ran two long extension cords from the 20A wall sockets in the test lab one for the amplifier the other for the test gear and started where I had left offThe AMP Vs specified voltage gain is 30dB I measured 309dB into 8 ohms for the balanced inputs and 3075dB for the singleended inputs All the inputs and outputs preserved absolute polarity ie were noninverting The input impedance was lower than the specified values 10k ohms balanced across the audioband rather than the specified 32k ohms the unbalanced input impedance was 67k ohms compared with the specified 15k ohms Still both values are high enough that compatibility problems are unlikely With the Damping Factor correction switched off the output impedance  was low at 014 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz Turning on the Damping Factor increased the output impedance slightly to 02 ohm Even so the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by less than ±02dB  The response into 8 ohms  was down by 15dB at 200kHz and the AMP Vs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured short risetimes with no overshoot or ringing Figs1 and 2 were taken with the balanced inputs The frequency and squarewave responses were the same for the unbalanced inputs and with Damping Factor on and offFig1 Accustic Arts AMP V Damping Factor On frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 Accustic Arts AMP V smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsLikely as a result of its dualmono construction the amplifiers channel separation was a superb 110dB in both directions below 1kHz falling to 80dB at the top of the audioband presumably due to capacitive coupling between channels Measured with the singleended inputs shorted to ground the Accustics wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio was a good 723dB ref 1W into 8 ohms  This ratio improved to 805dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 833dB when the reading was Aweighted The spectra shown in fig4 were taken at 1Wpc into 8 ohms Spuriae can be seen at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics which will be due to magnetic coupling from the two massive power transformers However these spuriae are very low in levelFig3 Accustic Arts AMP V spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  Fig4 Accustic Arts AMP V THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDN varied with output power with clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the amplifiers output reached 1 With both channels driven into 8 ohms the AMP V didnt meet its specified maximum power of 900Wpc  at 1 THDN clipping at 665Wpc  note however that I dont hold the wall voltage constant during the testing and the wall voltage dropped from 1192V with the amplifier idling to 1142V with both channels of the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms Similarly into 4 ohms again with both channels driven I measured clipping power of 890Wpc  the specified value is 1360Wpc  This time the wall voltage dropped to 1115VFig5 Accustic Arts AMP V THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsAs I always do I saved the measurement of the AMP Vs clipping power into 2 ohms until the very end However when I performed my penultimate test which was to measure how THDN varied with frequency at 20V  the amplifier turned itself off after 10 seconds of driving 2 ohms at this level  I had assumed that this would be due to protection circuitry doing its job however after I removed the power cables let the amplifier cool down and plugged it back in it wouldnt turn on again Each of the two AC power sockets has two fuses all four were okay The AMP V also has internal fuses which must have gone opencircuit I removed the 10 bolts that hold the top panel in place but I wasnt able to remove it I tried everything I could think of that did not present a substantial risk of damaging the finishFig6 Accustic Arts AMP V THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Returning to the measurements Fig6 shows that the distortion is very low over most of the audioband into both 8 and 4 ohms though a little higher in the right channel  than the left  The THD rises in the top octave—this will be due to a restricted openloop bandwidth reducing the amount of negative feedback available—but it remains below 017 at 20kHz into 4 ohmsThe waveform of the THDN at 100Wpc into 8 ohms with the 1kHz fundamental notched out  suggests that the distortion signature consists primarily of loworder harmonics The spectrum of the AMP Vs output with a 50Hz signal at that level into 8 ohms  shows that the second harmonic lay at –106dB  in both channels the third harmonic at –96dB in the left channel  and at –88dB in the right channel  Supplyrelated spuriae are visible but all lie at or below –96dB Fig9 shows the spectrum of the AMP Vs output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 100Wpc The secondorder difference product at 1kHz lies at a negligible –100dB  and the higherorder intermodulation products are all at or below –86dB Fig7 Accustic Arts AMP V 1kHz waveform at 100Wpc

intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100Wpc peak into 8 ohms  The Accustic Arts AMP V offers extremely high power coupled with extremely low distortion But why did those internal fuses blow—assuming thats what happened—after a short while driving 200Wpc into 2 ohms with highfrequency test tones I dont know what caused it but I can confidently say that this is unlikely to happen with a music signal Footnote 1 As the flightcase base rose only a couple of inches up the sides of this large amplifier ventilation was unlikely to be significantly affected
