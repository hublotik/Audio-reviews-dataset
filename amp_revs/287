0, Outlaw Model 7140 seven  channel home theater power amplifier The 7140 seems to have come out a few years ago and is shown as discontinued At the time it was out the cost was a reasonable US 1100 The new replacement series 7000X looks just like this so not sure what they have changedThe 7140 is a beast of an amplifier nearly breaking my back carrying it up to my labThe design is highly modular with a massive toroidal transformer powering 7 independent amplifiers each with their own power supply on board The heatsinks are rather beefy with plenty of distance between them and top of the unit The feet are also quite tall allowing better ventilation from bottom to topThe back panel shows the inclusion of XLR inputs which I appreciateThe inclusion of a grounding terminal was interesting  It did no good in my testing with XLR inputs as it should notDuring use the 7140 was quite stable never complaining shutting down or anything as AudioVideo Receivers  tend to do Clearly then this is a more robust solution than internal amps in those unitsPower Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard view of 5 watts into 4 ohm load using a 1 kHz toneI was surprised to see such high mains hum at 60 Hz A prior review of another unit with just RCAs complained about the same thing and recommended a ground terminal on the unit which they have added But as I mentioned it made no difference I have to think this is magnetically coupled into the amplifiersFortunately or unfortunately the distortion spike from 2nd harmonic is bit higher still so didnt impact measured SINAD  As it is the 7140 lands below the average for all the amplifiers we have reviewed so farFrequency response is flat enough32tone signal to resemble music shows the typical rise of distortion with frequencyAnd rather high noise floor which could be caused by that power supply humHere are the noise figures for 5 watt and full powerWe are not clearly more than 14 bits or so at 5 watts so not very quietHere is our power versus distortion and noise at 8 ohmWe see the elevated noise and distortion relative to our reference amplifier Power produced is right on the money at 146 wattsHere is the same at 4 ohmThe above tests are at 1 kHz Here is what happens when we sweep the frequencies aiming to measure power at 1 THDNQuite a drop in power with both loads when we get down to 20 Hz The power supply capacitors are likely too small to keep up with the slow rate of change at low frequenciesWe see a similar view when we look at sweeps at different frequenciesFinally some people like to see intermodulation distortion of 19  20 kHz tones so here it is at max powerConclusionsThe Outlaw Model 7140 has a very sturdy build It produces good power per specifications provided from manufacturer  The down side is too much groundmains leakage and distortionnoise that is slightly below average Paying more  will get you sharp reduction of such problemsFor typical home theater duty the 7140 should do the job fine It just isnt something to get excited about from pure performance point of view
