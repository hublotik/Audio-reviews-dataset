0,The VAC Sigma 170i iQ uses two pairs of Gold Lion KT88 tubes for its output stages and eight smallsignal tubes The tubes are identified with a number this between the pins of the smallsignal tubes The tube locations are clearly indicated in the manual and the top panel has each tube socket marked with the appropriate tube number I carefully followed the numbering when installing the tubes before connecting the amplifier first to my   then to the magazines higherperformance APx555 analyzer in order to repeat some of the tests The conditionmonitoring LEDs for the four KT88s remained dark throughout the testing indicating that these tubes were operating correctly The output transformer taps are marked 8–16 4–8 and 2–4 I performed a complete series of tests from each of the three taps using the singleended linelevel inputs then repeated some of the tests using the balanced inputsThe Sigma 170i iQs unbalanced input impedance was a high 447k ohms at 20Hz dropping to a stillhigh 33k ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz The balanced input impedance was slightly greater than twice the unbalanced impedance across the audioband The 170i iQ inverted absolute polarity with both sets of inputs from all three transformer taps and from the preamplifier outputs The amplifiers maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms depended on the output tap The highest gain was from the 8–16 ohm tap at 481dB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs The gain from the 4–8 ohm tap was 478dB and from the 2–4 ohm tap it was 464dB These gains are somewhat higher than usually found in integrated amplifiers The gain at the preamplifier output was 216dB sourced from a low output impedance of 340 ohms at high and middle frequencies but from a high 3154 ohms in the low bassThe amplifiers output impedance depended on the output tap From the 8–16 ohm tap the impedance was an extremely high 88 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping very slightly to 8 ohms at 20kHz The VAC amplifier appears to adhere to telecommunications practice where the output impedance is similar in value to the load impedance This results in maximum power transfer to the load but as can be seen from the gray trace in fig1 it also results in large and very audible ±35dB variations in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker The variations in response were reduced to ±21dB with the 4–8 ohm tap—which had an output impedance of 44 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 4 ohms at 20kHz—and to ±12dB from the 2–4 ohm tap  This tap had an output impedance of 22 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 195 ohms at 20kHzFig1 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 8–16 ohm tap frequency

smallsignal bandwidth is wide and flat to 20kHz into resistive loads from all three transformer taps  though two ultrasonic resonances can be seen These were highest in level when the load impedance was lower than the nominal tap value This behavior is associated with a small amount of overshoot and ringing with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  At lower frequencies the amplifiers reproduction of squarewaves had flat tops and bottoms confirming the Sigma 170i iQs extended low frequenciesFig3 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 8–16 ohm tap smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFigs1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum The channel matching was within 02dB and didnt change at lower settings of the volume control Channel separation was not as good as I expected at 60dB L–R and 68dB R–L below 2kHz and the figures reduced to 35dB and 49dB respectively at the top of the audiobandMeasured at the 8–16 ohm taps and taken with the inputs shorted to ground the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was 499dB  ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to 692dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 763dB when Aweighted The SN ratios from the 4–8 ohm tap were slightly greater and up to 2dB greater from the 2–4 ohm tap correlating with the lower gainWith the volume control set to its minimum the main power supply–related spuriae in the Sigma 170i iQs noise floor were at 60Hz 120Hz and 180Hz  with the highest in level  lying at –72dB ref 1W from the 8–16 ohm tap into 8 ohms Peculiarly with the volume control set to its maximum and the amplifier driving 1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms sidebands appeared at ±120Hz ±240Hz and ±360Hz either side of the peak at 1kHz in this spectrum I repeated this spectral analysis at lower settings of the volume control and with several different grounding arrangements floating the amplifiers AC ground floating the SYS2722s signal generator ground and connecting the analyzers chassis and the VACs chassis with a separate wire and repeating these conditions with the APx555 system There was no change in this behavior it is probably due to a nonzero impedance connection from signal ground to powersupply ground somewhere in the Sigma 170i iQs circuitFig4 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 8–16 ohm tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at its maximum  and at its minimum  linear frequency scaleThe VAC amplifier is specified as delivering 85Wpc presumably into 8 ohms  which is a little higher than I would expect from a pushpull pair of KT88s Using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs THDnoise percentage reaches 1 the amplifier with both channels driven with a 1kHz signal clipped at 118Wpc into 8 ohms  from the 8–16 ohm output transformer tap  Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3 THDN resulted in a power of 51Wpc into 8 ohms  The shape of the trace in fig5 suggests that the amplifier is soft clipping with the usual sharp knee in the trace where the waveform squares off occurring at THDN levels above 3 Less power was available into 4 ohms from the 8–16 ohm tap 3 THDN being reached at 1075W Fig5 VAC

Sigma 170i iQ reached 1 THDN at 326Wpc into 8 ohms  and 79Wpc  at 3 THDN  Less power was available into 4 ohms from this tap 49Wpc at 3 THDN  The 2–4 ohm tap was probably optimal for real loudspeaker loads reaching 3 THDN at 53Wpc into 8 ohms  75Wpc into 4 ohms  and 74Wpc into 2 ohms Fig7 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 4–8 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig8 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 4–8 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig9 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 2–4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThe distortion levels in figs5–8 never drop below 01  this will be due in part to the presence of the powersupply noise noted earlier The lowest distortion I found was with the 2–4 ohm tap driving a load of 8 ohms This can be seen in fig10 which plots the THDN percentage against frequency at 635V which is equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms 10W into 4 ohms and 20W into 2 ohms The THDN was lowest in the low treble into 8 ohms  but rose at higher and lower frequencies and into lower impedances The left channel  had higher distortion into 4 and 2 ohms than the right Fig10 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 2–4 ohm tap THDN  vs frequency at 635V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The Sigma 170i iQs distortion in the left channel was predominantly the third harmonic  However the second harmonic was the highest in the right channel  though the distortion harmonics in this graph are below the level of the supplyrelated spuriae When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 8W into 8 ohms from the 2–4 ohm tap  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB  though the higherorder intermodulation products were a little higher in level Repeating this spectral analysis from the 8–16 ohm tap the 1kHz product rose to –60dB Fig11 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 8–16 ohm tap 1kHz waveform at 5W into 8 ohms 035 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig12 VAC Sigma 170i IQ 8–16 ohm tap

got the lowest noise by floating the signal generator ground and connecting the Sigma 170i iQs chassisgrounding terminal to the analyzer ground I primarily tested the VACs phono input from the preamplifier outputThe VACs phono stage inverted absolute polarity at all outputs in moving magnet and moving coil modes The MM input impedance was 53k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 465k ohms at 20kHz In MC mode with the input impedance set to 470 ohms I measured 71 ohms at 20Hz 430 ohms at 1kHz and 324 ohms at 20kHz With the input impedance set to 200 ohms I measured 70 ohms at 20Hz 183 ohms at 1kHz and 168 ohms at 20kHz With the input impedance set to 100 ohms I measured 60 ohms at 20Hz 89 ohms at 1kHz and the same at 20kHz With the volume control set to its maximum MM mode offered 569dB of gain at the preamplifier output and 818dB at the 8–16 ohm loudspeaker output In MC mode the maximum gain was 77dB at the preamplifier output and 1014dB at the 8–16 ohm loudspeaker output Taking the 216dB gain in the preamplifier section into account these measurements are consistent with the stated phonosection gains of 37dB  and 57dB The Sigma 170i iQs RIAA correction offered very low error  with a slight  boost in the bass before the sharp rolloff that indicates the presence of a subsonic highpass filter The RIAA correction was wellmatched between the channels However there is a slight peak apparent between 50kHz and 100kHz Fig14 VAC Sigma 170i IQ phono input MM mode response with RIAA correction With the volume control set to its maximum the phono inputs noise performance in MM mode was good with unweighted audioband signalnoise ratios  of 499dB left channel and 55dB right These ratios improved by 20dB when Aweighted The higher gain in the MC mode reduced the SN ratios this time ref 1kHz at 500µV by around 5dBThe Sigma 170i iQ phono input offered excellent overload margins at 27dB at 1kHz and 20kHz ref 1kHz at 5mV in MM mode In MC mode the overload margin was 26dB at both frequencies ref 1kHz at 500ÊV However the margins were very much lower at 20Hz at around 3dB in both MM and MC modes Lowoutput phono cartridges will work better with the VACs phono stage The phono inputs distortion was low primarily consisting of the second harmonic At an input level 6dB higher than the nominal MM output level of 5mV this lay at –60dB  Intermodulation distortion via the VACs phono input was similarly low Fig15 VAC Sigma 170i IQ phono input MM mode spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 10mV input Fig16 VAC Sigma 170i IQ phono input MM mode HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100mV peak input Especially in terms of its output impedance the VAC 170i iQ resembles other classic tubeamp designs such as the  PrimaLuna Prologue Premium A common argument in favor of such designs is that they dont employ feedback to reduce their output impedance which can have negative sonic consequences But there are also sonic consequences to such high output impedances As illustrated in figs1 and 2 when used from the 4–8 ohm and 8–16 ohm transformer taps this amplifier will change sonic character with every loudspeaker it is used with
