0, SMSL DA6 stereo desktop class D amplifier It was sent to me by Shenzhen Audio and costs US 99Ah what a pleasure it was to unpack the DA6 and see this nice thin packaging That niceness extends to the back fixing one of my main complaints with compact amplifiersInstead of stacking the binding posts on top of each other and thereby making it very difficult to put large binding posts they are lined up horizontally This allowed me to connect my locking banana plugs into them with relative ease Of course we are saddled with large laptop power supply running at 24 volts at nearly 7 ampsA remote control is provided to navigate through the menus to change basstreble settings volume control etc Same can be done with the front panel and rotary controlA new Infineon class D amplifier IC is used here SMSL DA6 MeasurementsLets start with our usual dashboardRelative sum of noisedistortion as expressed in SINAD lands the unit above average of some 350 amplifiers testedI am assuming volume is controlled digitally given the perfect channel balanced Noise performance by itself is good for the classFrequency response in EQ bypass mode still has a bit of low frequency roll offType of speaker you drive with this little amp could benefit from being pushed to play those low frequencies I thought I could fix that by boosting the bass setting one notch That tool though brings a sledgehammer to a nail being put on the wall to hang a pictureOh I forgot to mention that there is no load dependency which is something we often cant find even in expensive class D amplifiers Not only that the response is quite extended going beyond 100 kHz I guess this is what they mean by highresolutionThere is no warm up requirement as the unit is stable out of the box running quite coolMultitone performance is again good for the classOutput power is more modest than I wanted to see but I guess you cant have miraclesThe response though seems dependent on level and keeps changing at micro level  We see the same when we sweep with different frequenciesThere is no headroom as expectedConclusionsSMSL nails the industrial design and usability of a super compact desktop amplifier offered in attractive aluminum case A clear white display shows the volume control and inclusion of remote control lets you place it out of the way and still change its volume I dont usually take price into account but in this class I must For 99 this is a lot of performance and good lucksdesignI am happy to recommend SMSL DA6
