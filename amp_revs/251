0, Peachtree GAN400 stereo balanced  amplifier   costs US 2499I am not generally a fan of peachtree audio product looks but this one in coffee stain looks pretty good Other than a power switch not much else is there Ditto on the back sideThe claim to fame of this amplifier is use of GaN transistors which in theory simplify the design of a class D amplifier  and improve its efficiency  And in theory it can also produce lower distortion  The drawback is much higher cost of the transistors compared to MOSFETs Lets see if the performance is therePeachtree GAN400 MeasurementsI performed all of my testing using XLR input Lets start with our usual input of 1 kHz with output into 4 ohm to the tune of 5 wattsThere is fair bit of inconsistency between the channels with respect to SINAD I switched my loads and issue persisted so it is not my setup Averaging the two we get 84 dB which is slightly average for all amps tested but not where performance should beFrequency response is disappointing as it shows load dependencyThis means that the high frequency response will be speaker dependent which is not good I expect this kind of performance in ultra budget amplifiers  not at this priceNoise performance is good but again not where it should beSame for multitone distortionCrosstalk however is superb indicating two independent amplifiersThere is lots of power both at 4 and 8 ohmsAs noted though the curve starts to go up prior to clipping which means distortion is increasingThe amplifier more than meets its 400 watt spec at 1 THDThe shape of THDN graph is very smooth which perhaps could be attributed to GaN transistor designThere is no pop on power up but there is when you shut it downThe amp is stable on power up so no need to leave it onPeachtree GAN400 Power Stress TestWith the owners permission  I subjected the amp to varying load angle  and down to 2 ohm impedance It did very wellVariations of Â±60 degrees did not bother it at all at either 4 or 8 ohm A bit strangely at 2 ohm it would not run with 0 load angle but did produce half the output at other angles  Since minimum impedance is 25 oh we cant fault it for this FYI I tested a couple of amps at my disposal and the both got quite unhappy with varying phase angles shutting down and such Whereas the GAN400 marched through this test without once going into protectionConclusionsI just bought a 65 watt GaN based USBC charger and am amazed at how small it is The buzz from there has travelled to audio and has resulted in GaN based amps like this Peachtree Alas there is no performance advantage that can be seen in this implementation NoiseDistortion is only slightly better than average and far cry from top performing amplifiers we have tested in the past Combine this with quite high price of 2500 and this is a difficult offer to swallow Good news is that there is plenty of power at 400 watts independent of the load Personally I dont see a reason to pay so much for this level of performance so I cant recommend the Peachtree GAN400 amplifier
