Peachtree GAN400 stereo balanced amplifier costs US 2499I generally fan peachtree audio product looks one coffee stain looks pretty good Other power switch much else Ditto back sideThe claim fame amplifier use GaN transistors theory simplify design class D amplifier improve efficiency And theory also produce lower distortion The drawback much higher cost transistors compared MOSFETs Lets see performance therePeachtree GAN400 MeasurementsI performed testing using XLR input Lets start usual input 1 kHz output 4 ohm tune 5 wattsThere fair bit inconsistency channels respect SINAD I switched loads issue persisted setup Averaging two get 84 dB slightly average amps tested performance beFrequency response disappointing shows load dependencyThis means high frequency response speaker dependent good I expect kind performance ultra budget amplifiers priceNoise performance good beSame multitone distortionCrosstalk however superb indicating two independent amplifiersThere lots power 4 8 ohmsAs noted though curve starts go prior clipping means distortion increasingThe amplifier meets 400 watt spec 1 THDThe shape THDN graph smooth perhaps could attributed GaN transistor designThere pop power shut downThe amp stable power need leave onPeachtree GAN400 Power Stress TestWith owners permission I subjected amp varying load angle 2 ohm impedance It wellVariations Â±60 degrees bother either 4 8 ohm A bit strangely 2 ohm would run 0 load angle produce half output angles Since minimum impedance 25 oh cant fault FYI I tested couple amps disposal got quite unhappy varying phase angles shutting Whereas GAN400 marched test without going protectionConclusionsI bought 65 watt GaN based USBC charger amazed small The buzz travelled audio resulted GaN based amps like Peachtree Alas performance advantage seen implementation NoiseDistortion slightly better average far cry top performing amplifiers tested past Combine quite high price 2500 difficult offer swallow Good news plenty power 400 watts independent load Personally I dont see reason pay much level performance I cant recommend Peachtree GAN400 amplifier
