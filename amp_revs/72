0, HiFi Rose RA180—serial number ESL203AB000182—from the one auditioned by Julie Mullins I performed the measurements  examining the amplifiers performance in both normal mode and in bridged  mode following the instructions in the excellent manual As Julie Mullins found the RA180 doesnt recognize 5G WiFi networks but I was able to connect it to my Netgear NightHawk routers 24GHz network I could control the RA180 with the RoseAMPConnect app on my iPhone as well as with the remote control and the frontpanel controlsAs the RA180s output stages operate in classD all the measurements other than frequency and RIAA responses were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which reduces the level of noise above 80kHz and eliminates noise above 200kHz Without the filter in normal mode a very high 133V of ultrasonic noise was present at each pair of loudspeaker terminals with a center frequency of 525kHz The ultrasonic noise level rose to 16V in bridged mode In both modes when amplifying an input signal the RA180 interfered with the reception of a portable FM radio that lives in the test labI dont precondition classD amplifiers before testing but the top panel became warm after a few hours its temperature measuring 1046°F404°CThe RA180 preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting from both its balanced and singleended line inputs in both normal and bridged modes The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms with the line inputs was 26dB balanced and 32dB singleended in normal mode and 6dB higher for both inputs in bridged mode The balanced input impedance is specified as 44k ohms I measured 43k ohms at all audio frequencies The unbalanced input impedance measured 443k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping inconsequentially to 29k ohms at 20kHz compared with the specified 47k ohmsThe source impedance in normal mode including the series resistance of 6 of speaker cable was a low 01 ohms at low and midrange frequencies rising to 04 ohms at the top of the audioband The variation in the HiFi Rose amplifiers smallsignal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was a negligible ±01dB Into 8 ohms  the RA180s response rose above the audioband reaching 12dB at 65kHz before sharply rolling off reaching –3dB just above 100kHz This peak is associated with a degree of overshoot in the RA180s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  but there was no ringing Into lower impedances the response starts to roll off in the top audio octave with the most extreme result being into 2 ohms  where the output at 20kHz is down by 2dBFig1 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe source impedance in bridged mode was higher at 015 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz 1 ohm at 20kHz doubling the variations in response with the simulated loudspeaker  and increasing the 20kHz rolloff into 2 ohms to –4dB However overshoot was now minimal in the bridged modes reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum and the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings However a peculiar 1dB boost in the midrange and bass appeared at lower settings of the volume control  This behavior was consistent with balanced and singleended inputs in both output modes The cyan and magenta traces in fig3 show the action of the Subsonic setting The main outputs roll off rapidly below 100Hz reaching –9dB at 40Hz This rolloff seems too extreme for typical listening so perhaps it could be used when adding a subwoofer to the system However there is no means of altering either the highpass filters frequency or its slopeFig3 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with volume control set to the maximum  and with subsonic filter activated  and with volume control set to –20dB  The behavior of the bass and treble tone controls set to their maximum and minimum settings is shown in fig4 Some overlap in their passbands can be seen in this graph and the maximum cut or boost is higher than useful at ±15dB in the treble and ±175dB in the bass The Active Crossover controls adjust the turnover frequency level of the secondary amplifier outputs which can be used to drive supertweeters Fig5 shows the behavior of this output with the frequency set to 085 and 217 The controls numerical values approximately coincide with the highpass filters –3dB frequencyFig4 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with bass and treble controls set to the maximum center and minimum positions  Fig5 HiFi Rose RA180 supertweeter output frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with turnover frequency set to 085kHz  and 217kHz  The RA180s channel separation  was 80dB in both directions below 2kHz but the reading taken with the Audio Precision lowpass filter was affected by the presence of residual ultrasonic noise This noise which had a level of 15mV and a center frequency of 45kHz is equivalent to an unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio in normal mode  of 66dB  This ratio improved to 80dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 836dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the HiFi Rose in normal mode drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum  revealed a higher level of random noise in the left channel  than the right  Repeating the measurements with the volume control set to –20dB reduced the left channels noisefloor by 6dB  but the right channels floor by 2dB  In bridged mode  the levels of the lowfrequency random noise in both channels increased by approximately 8dBFig6 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to the maximum  and to –20dB  HiFi Rose specifies the RA180s maximum power in normal mode as 200Wpc into both 8 and 4 ohms respectively equivalent to 23dBW and 20dBW With our usual definition of clipping as being when the THDnoise reaches 1 the HiFi Rose amplifier with two channels driven in normal mode exceeded its specified powers It clipped at 290Wpc into 8 ohms  and 400Wpc into 4 ohms  In bridged mode with again two channels operating the RA180 went into protection below the actual clipping point turning off at 460Wpc into 8 ohms  and 322W into 4 ohms Fig7 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode left channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig8 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode left channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig9 HiFi Rose RA180 bridged mode left channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsThe downward slope below 50W in figs7–9 indicates that the measured THDN percentage is dominated by noise  Fig10 shows how the percentage of THDN varied with frequency in normal mode at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms  and 100W into 4 ohms  The THDN was very low in the bass and midrange particularly in the right channel but rose in the top audio octaves In bridged mode the performance into 8 ohms was similar to the normal modes behavior into 4 ohmsFig10 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms Fig11 shows the distortion waveform in normal mode with a 1kHz sinewave at 50W into 8 ohms The presence of bursts of switching noise at the waveform peaks makes interpretation difficult though it looks as if the second harmonic is dominant This was confirmed by spectral analysis  though the third harmonic was almost as high in level Repeating the analysis at the same power in bridged mode  revealed that all the distortion harmonics were lower in level than they had been in normal mode the third harmonic in particularFig11 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode left channel 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 002 THDN  distortion and noise waveform

8 ohms Intermodulation distortion was low in level With the RA180 driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms in normal mode  which will be equivalent to 50Wpc into 8 ohms in bridged mode the 1kHz difference product lay close to –110dB in both channels  and while the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were higher in level they still lay below –80dB Fig14 HiFi Rose RA180 normal mode HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms Turning to the phono inputs performance this preserved absolute polarity in both MM and MC modes The maximum gain measured at the loudspeaker outputs in normal mode was 784dB MM and 983dB MC Bridged mode increased both gains by 6dB The input impedance specified as 47k ohms was 44k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz in both MM and MC modes but dropped to 67k ohms at 20kHz again in both modes phono inputs adjustable equalization set to RIAA and the output measured at the speaker outputs without the Audio Precision lowpass filter The error in the RA180s RIAA equalization  was very low with superb channel matching This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum at lower settings the midrange and bass were boosted by 1dB as they had been for the line inputs Assessed with the inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum the phono inputs unweighted wideband SN ratios in MM mode were 723dB ref 1kHz at 5mV in both channels Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased this ratio to 741dB while switching in an Aweighting filter further increased the ratio to 806dB The ratios in MC mode ref 1kHz at 05mV were all 20dB lower correlating with the 20dB increased gain in this mode but the HiFi Roses phono stage is still relatively quietFig15 HiFi Rose RA180 phono input response with RIAA correction  The phono inputs overload margins were respectable in both modes at 13dB at 20Hz and 1kHz ref 1kHz at 5mV  and at 05V  However the overload margin at 20kHz was disappointing at –5dB again ref 1kHz at 5mV05mV In MM mode an input signal at 20kHz reached 1 THDN at 28mV which will be marginal with normaloutput moving magnet cartridges  Harmonic distortion was very low via the phono input the second and third harmonics with a 1kHz tone at 10mV respectively lying at –94dB  and –100dB  and all other harmonics at –110dB  And even at a peak level of 25mV just below the MM modes overload point an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones produced a 1kHz difference product at –74dB  with higherorder intermodulation products at negligible levelsThe HiFi Rose RA180 offers high powers in both its normal and bridged modes especially into 4 ohms with low mainly benign secondharmonic distortion I remain puzzled however by that 1dB boost in the midrange and bass at low volume control settings by the higherthanusual level of ultrasonic noise at the loudspeaker outputs and by the phono inputs limited overload margin at the top of the audioband
