0, C 3050 LE  As the NAD is a classD design I didnt precondition the amplifier by driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms Nevertheless before doing any testing I ran it for an hour at a moderate power level to ensure that it was fully warmed up At the end of that time the temperature of the black grille on the top panel was 921°F334°C Because classD amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slewrate limiting all the measurements other than frequency response were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 250kHz Without the filter 294mV of ultrasonic noise with a center frequency of 413kHz was present at the loudspeaker terminals This noise was also present at a much lower level at the headphone outputLooking first at the analog line input With the NADs volume control set to its maximum the tone controls active but set to do nothing the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured a relatively low 29dB from the speaker terminals 42dB from the headphone output and –007dB from the preamplifier output The line input preserved absolute polarity  from all three output types and the input impedance was close to the specified 28k ohms at 27k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to 236k ohms at 20kHz The power amplifier input impedance was 50k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 26k ohms at 20kHz with a voltage gain into 8 ohms of 29dBFig1 NAD C3050 LE line input frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 NAD C3050 LE line input smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe preamplifiers output impedance was 433 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz the impedance at the headphone output was 11 ohms again from 20Hz to 20kHz The C 3050 LEs output impedance at the speaker terminals was very low at 009 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz 01 ohm at 20kHz  Consequently the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  is minimal The traces in fig1 cut off sharply above 20kHz due to the C 3050 LE converting its line input to digital The C 3050 LEs reproduction of an analog 1kHz squarewave had the ringing on its leading and trailing edges that are typical of a linearphase reconstruction filter  and a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced as a sinewave due to the oddorder harmonics that would give the wave its square shape being removed by the AD converters antialiasing filterFig3 NAD C3050 LE line input frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with Bass and Treble controls set to 0dB 6dB and –6dB  Fig3 shows the effect of the NADs bass and treble controls set to their 6dB and –6dB positions The bass control offers a range of 65dB–55dB below 50Hz the treble control 57dB–52dB at 20kHz Channel separation was good rather than great at 70dB in both directions below 1kHz decreasing to 49dB at 20kHzFig4 NAD C3050 LE line input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms With the Audio Precision ultrasonic filter the line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured a good 721dB in both channels Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 75dB and an Aweighting filter increased it further to 774dB Spectral analysis of the NADs lowfrequency noisefloor  revealed no spuriae related to AC powerFig5 NAD C3050 LE line input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 NAD C3050 LE line input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 NAD C3050 LE THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms The C 3050 LE is specified as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive the C 3050 LE clipped at 106Wpc into 8 ohms  and at 155Wpc into 4 ohms  Distortion levels at moderate powers  were very low though with an increase in the top two octavesFig8 NAD C3050 LE line input 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms 0032 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 NAD C3050 LE line input spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20Wpc into 8 ohms Fig10 NAD C3050 LE line input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 40Wpc peak into 4 ohms The shape of the THDN spuriae waveform at 10Wpc into 8 ohms  is obscured by highfrequency noise even with the Audio Precision filter but the distortion signature appears to be primarily thirdharmonic in nature This was confirmed by spectral analysis  with the second harmonic 10dB lower in level Intermodulation distortion was very low even into 4 ohms  though the digitization of this input led to aliasing products at 28kHz and 29kHz These frequencies suggest that the AD converter operates at a sample rate of 48kHzFig11 NAD C3050 LE phono input response with RIAA correction  Turning to the NADs MMcompatible phono input I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the NADs rear panel to obtain the lowest noise This input preserved absolute polarity at all three outputs The phono inputs RIAA correction was superbly accurate  though it cut off sharply above 21kHz due to the input being digitized The input impedance measured 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping slightly to 34k ohms at 20kHz The maximum gain at 1kHz was 336dB at the Pre output 387dB at the headphone output and 6255dB at the loudspeaker outputs To avoid clipping the power amplifier stage I turned off the speaker outputs removed the prepower jumpers and performed all the subsequent testing using the preamp outputFig12 NAD C3050 LE phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz for 5mV input The wideband unweighted SN ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a very good 647dB in both channels ref 1kHz at 5mV Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 71dB while an Aweighting filter further increased the ratio to 789dB Spectral analysis of the phono inputs lowfrequency noisefloor  revealed very low levels of random noise and no power supply–related spuriaeFig13 NAD C3050 LE phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz for 20mV input Fig14 NAD C3050 LE phono input spectrum of 19 and 20kHz sinewaves DC–30kHz for 200mV input The phono inputs overload margins ref 1kHz at 5mV were usefully high at 193dB from 20Hz to 20kHz The phono inputs distortion signature was an equal mix of second and third harmonics both lying at a very low –100dB  with 1kHz at an input level of 20mV  The level of the 1kHz difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones was also very low at –100dB  performance of the C 3050 LEs digital inputs I used the Audio Precisions optical and coaxial SPDIF outputs and data sent to the C 3050 LE over my network using BluOS I saw no significant differences among the data sources Both SPDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHzWith the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in an output level of 597V into 8 ohms from the loudspeaker output which is 1376dB below the clipping level A signal at 0dBFS gave levels of 345V from the headphone output and 213V from the preamplifier output As with the phono input testing  digital inputs behavior at the preamplifier output with the speaker outputs turned offFig15 NAD C3050 LE digital input impulse response Fig16 NAD C3050 LE digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz The NADs impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the C 3050 LEs response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression at 24kHz though some lowlevel scalloping of the ultrasonic noisefloor is present An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  can be seen at –70dB and distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noisefloor the third harmonic being the highest in level at –67dB Fig17 NAD C3050 LE digital input frequency response with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Fig18 NAD C3050 LE digital input spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  When NADs frequency response with SPDIF data at 441 96 and 192kHz the response at all three rates dropped off sharply just below half of each sample rate  Increasing the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS lowered the noisefloor by 15dB  meaning that the C 3050 LE offers between 18 and 19 bits of resolution With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical With undithered 24bit data the result was a clean sinewave Fig19 NAD C3050 LE digital input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 0dBFS peak sampled at 441kHzThe secondorder intermodulation product at 1kHz with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 0dBFS lay at a low –97dB  though the higherorder products at 18kHz and 21kHz were 20dB higher in level The aliased images of the primary tones are present at 24kHz and 251kHzFig20 NAD C3050 LE digital input highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit TosLink data  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzFig21 NAD C3050 LE digital input highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit network data  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzThe NADs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit TosLink data  was superb with all the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave at the correct levels indicated by the sloping green line in this graph However the spectral spike that represents the highlevel tone at onequarter the sample rate is broadened at its base due to the presence of lowfrequency random noise jitter Repeating the analysis with 16bit network data  reduced the level of this random jitterLike NADs M10 the C 3050 LE offers excellent measured performance overall
