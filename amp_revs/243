0, Outlaw 2200 singlechannel amplifier The 2200 costs US 399 plus shipping although I read that it goes on sale for less than thatI was surprised how svelte the 2200 is given its power capabilityThe diminutive size comes from class G implementation which varies the power supply with signal This sharply lowers the power loss at lower power levels allowing the heatsinks to be much smaller  Despite its low 1U height the 2200 is heavy though courtesy of a larger pancake toroidal power transformerIt is always great to see balanced XLR input and trigger capability on amplifiersIn use the 2200 was solid as a rock It never shut down or complain and ran very cool even after full suite of tests I was worried about recommendation to stack these from Outlaw but after testing I think that can be done without much concernAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm loadSINAD is supposed to be sum of distortion and noise relative to our input signal Here distortion is very low approaching 105 dB So the fact that the SINAD is just 86 dB tells us that the number is dominated by noise as you will see shortly As it is this is above average for some 75 amplifiers tested so farHere is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and full powerFrequency response is a bit more limited than I like to seeMeasured power at both 4 and 8 ohms exceed outlaw specificationsEven more power is on tap if you allow higher distortion or for momentary peaksWideband spectrum analysis shows very clean outputThose of you who are bothered by class D switching noise should be happy to see this Indeed I performed all of my tests without an ultrasonic filter on my AnalyzerThermal StabilityPerformance was rock solid from cold to operating tempConclusionsThe Outlaw 2200 monoblocks provides solid performance easily besting the amps you get in a typical home theater AVR and then some Its slim packaging allows you to configure as many channels as you need without needing a lot of space Efficiency is good but doesnt bring with it the light weight of the class D I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2200 amplifier
