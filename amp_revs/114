0, Rotel RA6000   amplifier by operating it at 18 power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the temperature of the toppanel grilles over the heatsinks was almost too hot to touch at 1304°F542°C The RA6000 needs to be wellventilatedLooking first at the linelevel analog inputs the Rotel RA6000s maximum voltage gain from the loudspeaker output at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 2214dB for the balanced input and 278dB for the unbalanced inputs For the latter the maximum gain was 128dB from the Pre output and 2784dB from the headphone output The amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting from all its outputs The balanced input impedance was close to the specified 100k ohms at 94k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 90k ohms at 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance is specified as 56k ohms I measured 565k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 55k ohms at 20kHz This is on the low side tubed components with a high source impedance at low frequencies might sound a little lightweightThe source impedance from the Pre output was close to 100 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The headphone outputs source impedance was a very high 665 ohms again at all audio frequencies which wont be optimal for lowimpedance headphones The loudspeaker output impedance was a very low 009 ohms at low and middle frequencies increasing very slightly to 011 ohms at the top of the audioband The variation in the Rotel amplifiers smallsignal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±01dB Fig1 Rotel RA6000 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Into 8 ohms  the RA6000 offered a very wide smallsignal bandwidth which correlated with the short risetimes in the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into this load  Commendably despite the wide bandwidth no overshoot or ringing was seen in the squarewave response The increase in output impedance at very high frequencies meant that the response into 2 ohms  was down by 2dB at 100kHz which is inconsequentialFig2 Rotel RA6000 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum and with the tone controls bypassed the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control  Switching in the tone controls but with them set to do nothing reduced the level at 1kHz by 01dB Fig3 shows the effect of the controls set to their maximum and minimum positions They cut or boost the bass and high treble by up to 14dB The RA6000s channel separation  was 80dB in both directions below 2kHz decreasing slightly to 68dB at 20kHzFig3 Rotel RA6000 frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to 0 and to maximum and minimum The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was 605dB  improving to 759dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 786dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the Rotel amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum  revealed the presence of lowlevel ACrelated spuriae at 60Hz and its odd and evenorder harmonics The levels of these spuriae didnt change when I repeated the analysis with the volume control set to –12dB Fig4 Rotel RA6000 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum  and to –12dB  Rotel specifies the RA6000s maximum continuous power as 200Wpc into 8 ohms  and 350Wpc into 4 ohms  With clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 I measured clipping powers with both channels driven of 250Wpc into 8 ohms  and 410Wpc into 4 ohms  The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the distortion lies beneath the noisefloor below the clipping powerFig5 Rotel RA6000 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms Fig6 Rotel RA6000 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 shows how the percentage of THDN in both channels varied with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms  100W into 4 ohms  and 200W into 2 ohms  The THDN was very low in the midrange and bass into 8 and 4 ohms but rose into 2 ohms and at high frequencies  The distortion waveform was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  which lay close to the level of the AC supplyrelated spuriae  Intermodulation distortion was also very low in level even at 100Wpc into 4 ohms Fig7 Rotel RA6000 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms   and 2 ohms Fig8

rates up to 192kHz Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that the RA6000s USB input accepted 16 and 24bit integer data sampled at all rates from 441kHz to 768kHz Apples USB Prober app identified the RA6000 as ROTEL USB Audio 20 from ROTEL and the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous modeAll the digital inputs preserved absolute polarity With the volume control set to its maximum data representing a 1kHz tone at –20dBFS resulted in a level of 2993mV at the Pre output and 635V at the headphone and speaker outputs All the following measurements were performed at the Pre output with the loudspeakers turned off However even without the loudspeakers active the amplifier went into protection mode with highlevel highfrequency digital input signals To prevent this happening I set the volume control to –12dB for the test results shown in figs12 and 15Fig11 shows the RA6000s impulse response with 441kHz data It is typical of a short minimumphase reconstruction filter with a small amount of ringing following the single fullscale sample With 441kHz whitenoise data  the filter rolled off slowly above the audioband not reaching full stopband attenuation until 44kHz The shape of the ultrasonic rolloff is familiar it is typical of the filter used by MQAcapable devices for nonMQA data With a 191kHz tone at –3dBFS  the slow rolloff means that the aliased image at 25kHz is only suppressed by 17dB The harmonics associated with the 191kHz tone are all very low in level however The Rotels frequency responses with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHz  all followed the same basic shape flat in the audioband then rolling off just below half the sample rateFig11 Rotel RA6000 impulse response Fig12 Rotel RA6000 wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at –3dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig13 Rotel RA6000 frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  and 192kHz  The red trace in fig14 plots the error in the analog output level as a 24bit 1kHz digital tone steps down from 0dBFS to –140dBFS The amplitude error is negligible until the signal lies below –100dBFS which implies that the DAC resolution is not significantly greater than 17 bits This was confirmed by the fact that an increase in bit depth from 16 to 24 with dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  dropped the level of the RA6000s noisefloor by around 9dB which implies a resolution between 17 and 18 bits With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS the waveform was symmetrical with the three DC voltage levels described by the data well resolved  though a small DC offset of 50ÊV was present Repeating the measurement with undithered 24bit data gave a rather noisy sinewave Fig14 Rotel RA6000 left

terminal to the grounding post on the Rotels rear panel to obtain the lowest noise The maximum gain at 1kHz was 496dB at the Pre output and 761dB at the headphone and the loudspeaker outputs As with the digitalinput testing I performed all the phonoinput testing using the Pre output and other than SN ratio with the volume control set to –12dB in order to avoid the amplifier turning itself off with highlevel highfrequency signalsThe Rotels phono input preserved absolute polarity at all three outputs The input impedance specified as 47k ohms measured 64k ohms at 20Hz 60k ohms at 1kHz and 52k ohms at 20kHz The phono inputs audioband RIAA correction was superbly accurate in the audioband with excellent channel matching  though with a slight rise in the low bass before rolling off to reach –3dB at 10Hz The response rises above 20kHz reaching 3dB at 100kHz This behavior is too high in frequency and too low in level to imply the presence of the socalled Neumann 4th pole modification of the original RIAA curve but it might slightly emphasize the audibility of record clicks by adding overshoot to the transient waveformFig20 Rotel RA6000 phono input response with RIAA correction  The wideband unweighted SN ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a very good 71dB in both channels ref 1kHz at 5mV Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 74dB while an Aweighting filter further increased the ratio to 80dB Spectral analysis of the phono inputs lowfrequency noisefloor revealed very low levels of random noise but there were power supplyrelated spuriae present at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonicsThe phono inputs overload margins measured at the Pre output and ref 1kHz at 5mV were superbly high at 235dB at 20Hz and 1kHz and 226dB at 20kHz The phono inputs distortion signature was primarily oddorder harmonics but even with an input signal of 25mV these all lay below –90dB  Intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones was also low in level even with a signal peaking just 9dB below the overload point Fig21 Rotel RA6000 phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz for 25mV input measured at preamp output Fig22 Rotel RA6000 phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz with an input signal 9dB below the overload level The Rotel RA6000s measured performance is typical of a welldesigned modern solid state integrated amplifier It offers high power with low distortion and a wellmanaged gain architecture for all three types of inputs line digital and phono Although the resolution of its DA section is relatively limited that should be put against the low noise and high overload margins of the moving magnet phono input
