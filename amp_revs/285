0, Argon SA1 integrated amplifier with phono input and Bluetooth It is on kind from a European member and costs â‚¬369I have a soft spot for white audio electronics and the SA1 goes right after that Quite elegant What I didnt like is the lack of indication on the file LEDs which indicate inputs The volume control is digital  Pushing it selects the input The LEDs also blink for other reasons I did not try to figure out Here is the back panelIt was odd to see just a type A USB that is indicated as USB power There should be proper USB input in this day and age There is preout but in my testing I found that the volume control did not adjust it when using digital input but did with phono Maybe this was operator error I dont know as only a single halfsheet of instructions is provided with the unitThe unit as shipped is for 50 Hz250 volt so I used my lab AC generator to power it Specifications say 40 watts of power so thought my 300 VA lab supply is enough As it turns out it was not See the measurement sectionFYI there is a very clos cousin of this unit from NAD in the form of AMP1 I could not find either for sale in US The AMP1 lacks Bluetooth I believe but has Chromecast built in  It is not clear who built this unit Likely it is an OEM for bothArgon SA1 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit Toslink and measured from the preout The output was severely clipped So I brought the input level down 12 dB to our nominal 2 volts and no clippingThis lands the unit in the middle of our fair categoryI like to see a SINAD of over 100 dB for this class product and we are good few dBs short here Here is the response sweep of digital input levelsOur dynamic range is just OKAt this point the picture of the DAC performance is clear so I thought I cut to the chase and measure the amplifierArgon SA1 Amplifier MeasurementsWith amplifiers that have both analog input and digital I start by testing both to see which is more transparent and run with that Here is analog inputThis is not a happy picture with rising low frequency noise and distortion that is just below 80 dB Lets try Toslink inputAh that is much better The combination of noise and distortion is well above average nowSo lets continue with Toslink input starting with our SNRWe are a few dBs short of my 96 dB requirement for 5 watts but 88 dB is not so bad I expected crosstalk to be better given the digital inputFrequency response shows some load dependency in this Class D amplifier but better than many with this problemLets see how much power we have starting with 4 ohm loadMultitone performance is goodI could not get to clipping range as my AC lab supply would shut down So likely there is more power to be had as you can see in this dynamic testI did have enough juice to run the 8 ohm testIn both cases the SA1 beats the ARCAM AVR10 in noise which is goodArgon SA1 Phono MeasurementsThere was tremendous amount of mains interference in the phono stage dashboard I am not going to show that as it may be due to use of my lab supply But here is the all important RIAA equalizationIt seems to be a little heavy handed in upper bass with a rumble filter builtin Not bad but not perfect eitherConclusionsI really like the way the SA1 looks But looks cant get me over checklist DAC performance of around 16 bits The analog input on the amp doesnt perform well but digital does Overall I have mixed feelings on the unit so not going to pass judgement one way or the other I let you all do that by answering the poll
