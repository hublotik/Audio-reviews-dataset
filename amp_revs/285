Argon SA1 integrated amplifier phono input Bluetooth It kind European member costs â‚¬369I soft spot white audio electronics SA1 goes right Quite elegant What I didnt like lack indication file LEDs indicate inputs The volume control digital Pushing selects input The LEDs also blink reasons I try figure Here back panelIt odd see type A USB indicated USB power There proper USB input day age There preout testing I found volume control adjust using digital input phono Maybe operator error I dont know single halfsheet instructions provided unitThe unit shipped 50 Hz250 volt I used lab AC generator power Specifications say 40 watts power thought 300 VA lab supply enough As turns See measurement sectionFYI clos cousin unit NAD form AMP1 I could find either sale US The AMP1 lacks Bluetooth I believe Chromecast built It clear built unit Likely OEM bothArgon SA1 DAC MeasurementsI fed unit Toslink measured preout The output severely clipped So I brought input level 12 dB nominal 2 volts clippingThis lands unit middle fair categoryI like see SINAD 100 dB class product good dBs short Here response sweep digital input levelsOur dynamic range OKAt point picture DAC performance clear I thought I cut chase measure amplifierArgon SA1 Amplifier MeasurementsWith amplifiers analog input digital I start testing see transparent run Here analog inputThis happy picture rising low frequency noise distortion 80 dB Lets try Toslink inputAh much better The combination noise distortion well average nowSo lets continue Toslink input starting SNRWe dBs short 96 dB requirement 5 watts 88 dB bad I expected crosstalk better given digital inputFrequency response shows load dependency Class D amplifier better many problemLets see much power starting 4 ohm loadMultitone performance goodI could get clipping range AC lab supply would shut So likely power see dynamic testI enough juice run 8 ohm testIn cases SA1 beats ARCAM AVR10 noise goodArgon SA1 Phono MeasurementsThere tremendous amount mains interference phono stage dashboard I going show may due use lab supply But important RIAA equalizationIt seems little heavy handed upper bass rumble filter builtin Not bad perfect eitherConclusionsI really like way SA1 looks But looks cant get checklist DAC performance around 16 bits The analog input amp doesnt perform well digital Overall I mixed feelings unit going pass judgement one way I let answering poll
