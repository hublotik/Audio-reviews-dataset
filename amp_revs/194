0,The Line Magnetic LM845IA looks identical to the companys LM518IA integrated amplifier that Herb Reichert reviewed in October 2015 However there are many differences in the details The amplifier still uses a single 845 directly heated triode for each channels output stage  I followed the instructions in the manual for setting the bias current for these tubes at the recommended 70mA After the amplifier had been operating for 30 minutes I shorted the inputs to ground and adjusted the humbalancer controls to minimize the noise in each channels output  amplifier with my   The output transformer taps are marked 16 8 and 4 I performed a complete series of tests from each of the three taps using one of the singleended linelevel inputs then repeated some of the tests using the singleended PreIn input which is connected directly to the LM845s power amplifier stageThe LM845IAs unbalanced input impedance was a high 70k ohms at 20Hz dropping slightly to 675k ohms at 1kHz and to a stillhigh 44k ohms at 20kHz The PreIn input impedance was 55k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 43k ohms at 20kHz The Line Magnetic amplifier preserved absolute polarity with both sets of inputs from all three transformer taps The amplifiers maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms depended on the output tap The highest gain was from the 16 ohm tap at 403dB The gain from the 8 ohm tap was 386dB and from the 4 ohm tap it was 363dB The gains using the PreIn input were all 15dB lowerThe amplifiers output impedance also depended on the output tap From the 16 ohm tap the impedance was a high 39 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping very slightly to 365 ohms at 20kHz This results in very audible ±2dB variations in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker load  The variations in response were reduced to ±11dB with the 8 ohm tap which had an output impedance of 21 ohms at 20Hz and 195 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz As expected the lowest output impedance was from the 4 ohm tap 12 ohms at 20Hz and 11 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz While these impedances are relatively low for a singleended–triode amplifier the response modification from this tap with the simulated loudspeaker was a stillaudible ±08dB Fig1 Line Magnetic LM845IA 16 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Into resistive loads the smallsignal response from all three transformer taps was flat to 20kHz and rolled off above that frequency  The ultrasonic rolloff is disturbed by a residual resonance at 70kHz this highest in level from the 4 ohm tap This behavior is associated with a small amount of overshoot and ringing with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  At low frequencies the amplifier started to roll off below 30Hz but its reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave  had only slightly slopeddown tops and bottoms a tribute to the Line Magnetics massive output transformersFig2 Line Magnetic LM845IA 4 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load

with the volume control set to its maximum The channel matching was within 025dB but increased to 04dB in favor of the left channel at lower settings of the volume control Channel separation at 1kHz was okay at 61dB L–R and 647dB R–L but reduced to 452dB and 521dB respectively at the top of the audiobandMeasured at the 16 ohm taps and taken with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control at its maximum the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was 706dB  ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to 722dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 819dB when Aweighted The SN ratios from the 8 ohm tap were 2dB greater and another 2dB greater from the 4 ohm tap these improvements correlating with the lower gain from these taps  The main power supply–related spuriae in the LM845IAs noise floor were at 120Hz and 240Hz the latter higher in the left channel than the right  The highest in level at 120Hz lay at a respectably low –76dB right channel and –80dB left channel both ref 1W in both channels The 120Hz sidebands around the 1kHz tone were a little higher in level in the right channelFig5 Line Magnetic LM845IA 4 ohm tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at its maximum The Line Magnetic amplifier is specified as delivering 22Wpc though no load impedance is mentioned  Using our usual definition of clipping which is when the outputs THDnoise percentage reaches 1 with both channels driven with a 1kHz signal the LM845IAs 16 ohm tap clipped at just 2Wpc into 16 ohms  Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3 THDN resulted in a power of 18Wpc into 16 ohms  and the amplifier output the specified 22W from this tap at 35 THDN Distortion at low powers was lower with the 16 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  and the amplifier now reached 1 THDN at 10Wpc  though the power at 3 THDN had dropped to 16Wpc Fig6 Line Magnetic LM845IA 16 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 16 ohmsFig7 Line Magnetic LM845IA 16 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsThe same trend was apparent with the 8 ohm tap where the lowest distortion at low powers was obtained with this tap driving 4 ohms  I usually expect tube amplifiers to give lower distortion when driving impedances greater than the nominal tap value However the LM845IA had greater distortion at low powers in this situation This can be seen in fig9 which plots the THDN percentage against power with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms The distortion is above 1 at all powers above 800mWFig8 Line Magnetic LM845IA 8 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig9 Line Magnetic LM845IA 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsThe shape of the traces in figs6–9 suggests that the amplifier is soft clipping with the usual sharp knee in the trace where the waveform visibly squares off occurring at THDN levels above 10The distortion levels in figs6–9 were taken with the left channel and never drop below 01  However the distortion was a little lower in the right channel than the left Fig10 plots the THDN percentage against frequency from the 8 ohm tap at 283V into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  which is equivalent to 1W and 2W respectively Except in the bass the left channel  had higher distortion into both impedances than the right  The distortion into all loads from all three transformer taps rose in the top audio octavesFig10 Line Magnetic LM845IA 8 ohm tap THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The LM845IAs distortion in the midrange was predominantly the sonically benign second harmonic  though the more troubling third harmonic was only slightly lower in level at low frequencies  When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 1W into 4 ohms from the 8 ohm tap  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB  in the left channel  but was 14dB higher in the right channel  The higherorder intermodulation products were all below 01  Repeating this spectral analysis from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms the 1kHz product in the right channel rose to –50dB Fig11 Line Magnetic LM845IA 4 ohm tap

amplifier with a singleended output stage It must be used with highsensitivity speakers like AHs Altec Valencias if distortion is not to become audible Counterintuitively the Line Magnetics 16 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps work best with speakers that have impedances lower than the nominal tap value However these two taps have sufficiently high output impedances that the amplifiers sonic character will be different with every loudspeaker with which it is used The 4 ohm tap has a lower output impedance but this is at the expense of higher distortion even at low powers than the higherimpedance taps
