0, ultra cheap  UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier on Amazon To make the clickbait title work  I omitted the cost of the external power supply you need to bring yourself What you get is a three board assemblyIt took less than 5 minutes to put the heatsink on the main class D amp chip and sandwich the main board with the top and bottom The chip used must be for smart speakers as it has voice prompts when you change inputs Speaking of that it has Bluetooth  analog and USB in The little heatsink has no air flow and in testing it got quite hot to touch at timesFor testing I used my lab power supply and set the output voltage to 24 volts  The supply has 3 Amps max current Amplifier is rated for dual 50 watts at that voltage inputUWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier MeasurementsI started testing with analog input with volume adjusted for 29 dB gainConsidering the price this is not half badI kludged up a USB type A to type A cable and ran the dashboard test againAs you see performance is not as good as analog input Worse yet just a few seconds later it lost stability and would no longer work reliably If I powered it down it would work for a second or two and then go crazy again It may be a design issue or my setup Either way I could only continue with analog input testingNoise floor is high as you can see in the FFT graphs aboveCrosstalk managed to be worse than the worst I have tested so farMultitone shows increased distortion at both ends of the spectrumThe most important test for class D amps shows strong load dependencySo the tonality you get will depend on speaker you hook up to itAs usual we fall way short of stated power levels8 Ohm performance was a bit betterResponse vs frequency is smooth but that may be due to high noise floor which masks distortionAmplifier Listening TestsI hooked up one channel to my Infinity Reference 253 speaker and starting to listen There was a lot more power than I expectedly likely due to only having to drive one channel The sound was surprisingly good until you cranked it to max volume Speaking of which if I paused input the last 25 of the volume range produced tweeter hiss that was audible to about 1 meter3 feetI was very satisfied with subjective performance until I landed on two clips both of which were busy with both bass and treble notes On these two tracks the sound was very distorted at almost all volume levels High frequencies would get gritty and distorted and bass response was bad as well I power cycled the unit and let it cool and it seemed to play well for a couple of seconds and then would get distorted It may be that the crest factor is too low causing the amp to drive hard most of the time with these two tracks And then it overheats and distortsConclusionsThe first amplifier I ever built  was this massive board and produced only 10 watts a channel It also cost us many months of allowance Compare that to this amplifier which for the price of a fast food meal for two gives you stereo sound that most of the time is impressively good If it did not distort on those two channels I would say you could build an amp with two of them and be in businessGiven the distortionheat issue I cant recommend the UWAYKEY amplifier
