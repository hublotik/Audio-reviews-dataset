SMSL SA400 switching desktop power amplifier testing costs US 660The SA400 powerful amplifier yet comes compact SMSL package UI would find desktop ampAmplification provided courtesy ST Micro STa516BE The marketing material SA400 shows digital feedback I dont see ST specs I clear addition SMSL part ST amplifier chip dont talk Either way input amplifier digital even though analog inputs need digitized used internallyA resonant LLC switching power supply provides heft juice needed drive amplifier small package Bluetooth input provided well subwoofer output low pass filter In addition tone controls included using dedicated JRC chipThere informative temperature measurement turn I see picture With normal music listening unit stay pretty cool In testing however case got fairly warm display indicated 58 degrees C I suggest stacking anything top SA400One issue mechanical whine internal coil I hear even nothing playing 1 foot When testing higher powers became much louder playing music wont able hear likely SMSL SA400 MeasurementsThere three gain settings performance similar I adjusted high gain 29 dB standard For rest testing I used adjusted high gain better comparison integrated amps adjusted wayDistortion around 90 dB pulls SINAD rather high noise floor This causes overall ranking slightly averageIndeed see noise issue SNR measurementsState art amplifiers get 16 bits dynamic range 5 watts two bits short Even full power adding noise 16 bit signal This fact bandwidth 20 kHz nukes idea playing highres contentSure would nice use ADC running 48 kHz 44 seems Use ADC likely reason noise floor higher would otherwise We seen AV receivers likewise digitize analog inputs There good news though The feedback amplifier taken post filtering means compensate interaction filter load The measurement shows actually two graphs one 8 ohm 4 Both land top showing amp doesnt care great We see best class D amps like Hypex Ncore PurifiCrosstalk good unpredictableYou see normal trend two amps Most important test amplifier much power much distortion noise lets look 4 ohmsThis powerful little amp producing nearly 500 watts power especially allow peakingIt complies spec I think 220 watts Power naturally drops 8 ohm still healthyOn last test power versus distortionnoise different frequencies The output quite uniqueI seen power amplifier show level frequency independence Yes 20 kHz bandwidth helps still even linear amplifiers dont produce dead straight sameness SA400 producing This quite excellentNote amp went protection 20 kHz 20 Hz sweep Alas indication display I power cycle unit get work againSMSL SA400 Amplifier Listening TestsEven though I listen every headphone amplifier I rarely power amplifiers I decided start listening tests amplifier good thing I used Infinity 253 speaker testing Despite driving one channel SA400 drove R253 extreme authority clarity Tons detail dynamics little else wish Putting ears next tweeter I could hear slight hiss inches away would disappear The sound enjoyable I still listening I type thisConclusionsSMSL brings us interesting unique power amplifier us Love load independence small packaging plus tons power Performance drops average levels areas nothing appears faulty poorly engineered I guess one reservation cost I sure much temporary given world order component shortages high shipping costs etc better retail target would 499 The warranty short 1 year well For DACs I worried warranty much amps I like see longer warrantyOverall I going put SMSL SA400 recommended list It delivers tons power weak points
