0, Hegel H160 using my recently recalibrated  system   on an amplifier I run it for an hour at onethird its specified maximum power which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage I cut short this preconditioning of the H160 after 20 minutes however as the THDnoise which had been just 000315 with the amplifier cold had risen to 083 The chassis was mildly warm at 922°F  but the temperature of the internal heatsinks must have been much higher Allowing the amplifier to cool brought back correct operation with very low distortion but this is not an amplifier suitable for sustained highpower use such as providing the music for a rambunctious partyThe volume control offers 99 steps with 0 being full mute activated by a relay However only alternate settings offered a reduction in gain eg both 99 and 98 offered maximum gain 97 and 96 produced a reduction in level of –1dB 95 and 94 a reduction of –2dB and so on The maximum voltage gain measured at the speaker terminals was a modest 316dB into 8 ohms for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs while the fixedgain linelevel outputs offered unity gain with a source impedance of 1k ohms across the audioband All outputs preserved absolute polarity  The unbalanced input impedance was a usefully high 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies this dropping inconsequentially to 34k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance however was on the low side at 94k ohms at all audio frequenciesThe output impedance was very low over most of the audioband at 007 ohm rising to 01 ohm at 20kHz  As a result the modulation of the H160s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was minimal The Hegel offers a wide smallsignal bandwidth its output into 8 ohms being down by 3dB at greater than the 200kHz limit of this graph which resulted in a superbly accurate shape to a 10kHz squarewave with very short risetimes and no sign of overshoot or ringing  The traces in fig1 were taken with the balanced input and the volume control set to its maximum Commendably there was no change in the frequency response and channel balance for different settings of the volume control or with the unbalanced inputsFig1 Hegel H160 volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Hegel H160 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was good rather than great at 80dB below 2kHz but 60dB at 20kHz The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted but the volume control set to its maximum—very much the worstcase situation—was good at 763dB in the left channel and 775dB in the right ref 1W into 8 ohms these respectively improving to 927 and 913dB when Aweighted The primary source of noise was the presence of powersupply–related components at the even and oddorder harmonics of 60Hz though all of these lay at or below –94dB ref 1W into 8 ohms Fig3 Hegel H160 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Specified to produce 150Wpc into 8 ohms  or 250Wpc into 4 ohms  the H160 clipped  at 175Wpc into 8 ohms  and 270Wpc into 4 ohms  The downsloping shape of the traces in these two graphs implies that the actual distortion remains below the noise floor at levels below 50W or so I therefore measured how the percentage of THDN changed with frequency at a reasonably high level 9V equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms and 20W into 4 ohms The results are shown in fig6 the right channel  is not quite as linear as the left  particularly in the top two audio octaves However the distortion remains very low across the audiobandFig4 Hegel H160 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Hegel H160 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Hegel H160 THDN  vs frequency at 9V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion signature in the midband is predominantly the third harmonic  This graph was taken from the left channels output the second harmonic was highest in the right channel  though at –90dB ref 50W into 8 ohms  high is not really the appropriate adjective Intermodulation distortion  was similarly very lowFig7 Hegel

intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms Turning to the H160s digital inputs With the volume control set to its maximum digital data at –12dBFS gave rise to a level of 245V into 8 ohms  from the speaker outputs which suggests that the amplifier at full volume will clip with data at –6dBFS Fortunately this will never happen outside the test lab but  digitaldomain performance at the fixedlevel line outputs with the speaker outputs muted to avoid overloading the amplifiers output stage Data at 0dBFS resulted in an analog level of 253V at the linelevel outputsI didnt test the H160s AirPlay input The coaxial and optical SPDIF inputs locked to datastreams with sample rates ranging from 441 to 192kHz With the USB input fed data from my MacBook Pro running on battery power Apples USB Prober utility reported the product string as DigiHug USB Audio from GFEC ASSP though the AudioMIDI utility identified the Hegel as TE7022 Audio w SPDIF This implies that the H160 uses the Tenor USB receiver chip which was confirmed by the fact that the Hegels USB input will not accept data sampled at 882kHz though it does accept 96kHz data USB Prober also indicated that the H160s USB port operates in the isochronous adaptive mode although as youll see later this does not result in compromised jitter rejectionThe impulse response with 441kHz data  reveals that the H160s digital reconstruction filter is a conventional timesymmetrical type with a rapid rolloff above the Nyquist frequency for 441kHz data this indicated in fig11 by the vertical green line at 2205kHz The red and magenta traces in this graph taken with 441kHzsampled white noise at –4dBFS reveal that the rolloff has reached the stopband noise floor by 25kHz the frequency of the aliasing image of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  The harmonics of this 191kHz tone are all very low in level Fig12 shows a more conventional manner of presenting digitaldomain frequency response with SPDIF data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  and 192kHz  All three pairs of traces feature a slight rise in response in the top audio octave reaching 075dB at 40kHz with the higher sample rates peculiarly the response with 192kHz data is no more extended than with 96kHz dataFig10 Hegel H160 line output impulse response at 441kHz Fig11 Hegel H160 line output wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig12 Hegel H160 line output frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Channel separation for the digital inputs was 100dB below 600Hz decreasing to 67dB at 20kHz Fig13 reveals that the H160s noise floor drops by up to 18dB when the bit depth is increased from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS which implies resolution of almost 19 bits which is excellent However an odd modulation of the noise floor is evident in the low treble with 24bit data in this graph  Nevertheless the Hegels reproduction of an undithered 16bit sinewave at exactly –9031dBFS  was superb with the three DC voltage levels described by the data readily resolved while undithered 24bit data gave a clean sinewave  Figs 13 and 14 were taken with SPDIF data repeating the tests with USB data gave identical results though I had to make sure that the bit depth was correctly set to 24bit integer with the AudioMIDI utility to get the maximum resolution with 24bit filesFig13 Hegel H160 line output spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Fig14 Hegel H160 line output waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data Fig15 Hegel H160 line output waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data Despite its USB input operating in the isochronous adaptive mode the H160 offered excellent rejection of wordclock jitter via USB and the SPDIF inputs were equally good With 16bit JTest data  all the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were at or close to their correct levels and no other sidebands were evident around the highlevel tone at onequarter the sample rate With 24bit JTest data  no sidebands are visible and the noise floor is clean and free from spuriaeFig16 Hegel H160 line output highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at

powerhouse though owners should make sure it is well ventilated if they want to play music at sustained high levels Its digitalanalog circuitry is workmanlike rather than the state of the art but a standalone digital processor offering better performance than this is going to cost as least as much as the Hegels 3500
