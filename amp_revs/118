0,    Before taking any measurements  Ayre by running it for 60 minutes at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms which is very much the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or classAB output stage Like the original MXR the MXR Twenty got hot the temperature of its heatsink fins reaching 1403°F  and the top of its case 1161°F  The THDnoise measured 003 with the amplifier cold and stabilized at 00178 with the amplifier hot While the Ayres unusual heatsink has sufficient thermal conductivity to be effective for an amplifier of this power rating the MXR does need to be used in a wellventilated spaceThe voltage gain into 8 ohms was a little lower than the specified 26dB at 251dB and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity its XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance is specified at a very high 2 megohms Though it is difficult to measure an impedance this high with any accuracy my measurement indicated that the input impedance was at least 1M ohm across the audioband Like the original MXR the output impedance was higher than usual for a solidstate design 026 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 028 ohm at 20kHz with a slight dependence on the load impedance This higherthanusual output impedance results in a slight  variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  The MXR Twenty however offers a very wide smallsignal bandwidth especially into higher impedances Into 8 ohms  for example the upper –3dB point is above 200kHz the limit of this graph and at 200kHz the response is down by just 15dB This wide bandwidth correlates with the excellent shape of a 10kHz squarewave  with very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing A 1kHz squarewave was reproduced with an essentially perfect shape Fig1 Ayre MXR Twenty

ohmsThe original MXR was a quiet amplifier but the Twenty handily exceeded it With the amplifiers input shorted to ground the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  measured an extraordinarily low 1099dB this improving to 1121dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 113dB when Aweighted The blue trace in fig4 shows a lowfrequency spectral analysis of the MXR Twentys output while it drove a 1kHz tone into 8 ohms The individual random noise components all lie close to –140dB and while powersupply–related spuriae can be seen at 120 and 240Hz these lie at a superbly low –121 and –129dB respectively The red trace in fig4 shows what happens when the output power is increased to 100W into 8 ohms Supplyrelated sidebands now appear at ±120 and ±240Hz but these are still at or below –112dB Fig4 Ayre MXR Twenty spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms  100W into 8 ohms  Figs 5–7 respectively plot how the percentage of THDN in the Ayres output changes into 8 4 and 2 ohms With our definition of clipping as being when the THDN reaches 1 the MXR Twenty comfortably exceeds its specified power of 300W into 8 ohms  With the wall voltage at 1224V AC the Ayre clipped at 360W into this load  and the distortion remained below 002 below 100W Into 4 ohms the amplifier clipped at 595W  and into 2 ohms it clipped at 720W  though the distortion was higher at lower powers into these loads  This can also be seen in fig8 which plots the THDN percentage against frequency at 8975V which is equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms 20W into 4 ohms and 40W into 2 ohms However the increase in distortion into lower impedances was not as great as it had been with the original MXRFig5 Ayre MXR Twenty distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Ayre

ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms At low powers the distortion was primarily the third harmonic  but at high powers this was joined by both the second harmonic at almost the same level  and by a regular series of higherorder products These were associated with lowlevel crossover distortion that was visible on the oscilloscope screen The original MXR had been better behaved in both this respect and when it came to highfrequency intermodulation at high powers While the secondorder difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lay at a low –84dB  some higherorder products were visible though it is fair to note that almost all of these lie at or below –90dB Fig9 Ayre MXR Twenty 1kHz waveform at 6W into 4 ohms 0057 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched

packs a great deal of power into its relatively tiny frame It is a true highresolution amplifier
