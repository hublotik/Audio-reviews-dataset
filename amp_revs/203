0, Benchmark AHB2 Amplifier using THX technology to reduce distortion I was going to request one for testing due to membership demand but to my pleasant surprise the company volunteered to contact me and send not one but two units I requested the second one because of something I was seeing in the measurements that turned out to be my issue not the amps The AHB2 retails for US 2999 from the company directThe AHB2 is a very compact form factor enabled by use of switching power supply to increase efficiencydensityThere is just a power switch in the front It might be but I constantly reached for the screw next to it to power it on Having the power switch be slightly different color or shape may help with thisThere are a set of LEDs that show the status of the amplifier They are driven by an FPGA  that monitors all aspects of the amplifier and shuts down the unit if stressed It did so very quickly and efficiently in my testing Usually this is done with purely analog or maybe a small microprocessor As such the coverage of scenarios that could damage the amplifier is much less complete than using the approach Benchmark is using in AHB2Here is the back panelThis is a very minimalistic approach given the small amount of real estate available Only input is XLR balanced which is just fine in my book A gain switch allows the input level to be controlled so that you can just use an RCA to XLR adapter and still get full power  At the other extreme the low gain setting is designed for professional preamps with lots of output getting its max power at 98 volts Using this scheme the signal to noise ratio can be improved as you will see in measurements laterFor speaker terminals there are two sets classic heavy duty banana jacks and SpeakOn The SpeakOn are locking and provide the best performance I lost about 3 dB of performance using the banana jacks due to less secure connect there So the measurements you see are with SpeakOn jacksAnother minor nit on that note I had a rather cheap SpeakOn cable and its plug was just large enough to hit the silver screws that the sockets are mounted with Typical round shaped SpeakOn ones are not an issue Flush mount screws would solve this problemThere is a switch for selecting stereo or mono bridged output The latter quadruples the amount of power available and unlike typical bridging according to Benchmark comes at no penalty in distortion I plan to test this later as it has a minimum impedance of 6 ohm so I could not use the 4 ohm setup I used for this testingThere is a very beefy AC mains cable with really nice locking tabs Insert it and it stays put unless you push the two red tabs on each side Nothing is more aggravating than the AC cable coming halfway lose from the IEC socketBeing a proper company of course the AHB2 comes with full set of regulatorysafetyemissions certifications which is super important with power amplifiers given the high voltages and currents running around in themIn use the AHB2 stays very cool for a power amplifier when it is idling outputting little power which was a nice surpriseAs to THX technology it merges a lowpower but very low distortion amplifier with a high power but higher distortion amplifier The distortion of the latter is not seen because it is producing so much power  The general scheme is not new dating back to 1980s but new implementation is We have seen this in stellar performance of Massdrop THX AAA 789 amplifier which broke new ground in level of distortion and noise Will the Benchmark AHB2 manage the same Lets seePower Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual I start with my 5 watt output test using 4 ohm load using SpeakOn terminals as notedI hope your jaw is on the floor just like mine was when I saw this picture emerge  113 dB THDN in a power amplifier Are you kidding meLook at the harmonic distortion The worst case spike is below 130 dB This is insanely good Of course this type of SINAD  crowns the Benchmark AHB2 as the best I have ever testedThe performance was so good I literally had to rebuild my dummy load to get there Even the quality of the metal used in the connectors matters to get to this level of distortion I replace all my dummy loads with higher precision ones that have much less VCR  Resistor values can become voltage dependent creating distortions of their own Up to about 105 dB of THDN it doesnt matter but beyond that the VCR was the dominant distortion not the Benchmark AHB2 amplifierIt was requested that I show the breakdown and distortion so here we areOur best case hearing threshold is 116 dB SPL so no question that this level of distortion is totally inaudible Separating the noise from THD we see that it is noise that we are measuring as THDN rather than distortionAnd this is with exceptional noise performance of Benchmark AHB2 as we see in the graph of THDN versus powerEven in high gain the AHB2 easily outperforms the DIY Hypex NC400 I had tested before which used to be the best amp I had testedWe have 185 watts of power at incredibly low distortion of 000016 besting the company specificationsNote that the FPGA protection mode kicks in and essentially shots the amplifier down past the limit You get absolutely distortionless and noiseless performance until there is no moreEDIT here is performance in bridged mode using same 4 ohm loadYou get 500 watts of stunningly clean power Protection circuit shut the unit down after that so it is quite safe to try With a THD essentially matching the nonbridged mode there is no reason to be afraid of trying thisIntermodulation distortion versus power level shows the same story of clean powerIf you want to know what you get for extra money over bargain amplifiers you can see the difference in the above graph We are not talking about 5 to 10 dB but whopping 40 dB betterI have had requests for intermodulation distortion using dual 19 and 20 kHz tones Here is thatTHDN versus output level looks far cleaner than anything I have tested beforeEven at the limit of our hearing  we have vanishingly low amount of distortion The graph is exaggerated so shows a rise there but in absolute levels despite 90 kHz bandwidth of the test we have incredibly low THDN of just 004The sharp spike at 45 Hz in green shows the amplifier going into protection mode So dont pump that sine wave continuously into it at 133 watts Frequency response is exceptional too as expectedSince this is not a switching amplifier there is no filter there allowing the bandwidth to go to 200 kHz and beyond Lowest band of AM radio is 450 kHz so likely you could use the AHB2 for an AM radio transmitter Usually when we test switching amplifiers we see all kind of interesting things in their outputs above hearing range The AHB2 is a classic configuration albeit with a switching power supply so all is well and clean hereMy reference graph for the Hypex NC400 used an AES filter  so I ran the AHB2 both ways with or without that filter Using the filter  so the two are equal we see much cleaner spectrum below 200 kHz and of course no massive switching spikes Worst case spike is below 115 dB In other words the Benchmark AHB2 is clean even in the areas you are not looking It is like a restaurant scrubbing their parking lot with soap and pad as well as their dishes My loose wires on dummy loads is not the best setup for measuring crosstalk but here it is anywayWhere our hearing is most sensitive  separation is around 100 dB which is way way more than we need Despite the small enclosure the AHB2 manages exceptional numbers hereEDIT forgot to run the classic SNR test in the original reviewWow assuming you play at peak of 120 dBSPL your noise floor will be at 10 dBSPL That is absolute silenceConclusionsIt goes without saying that the Benchmark AHB2 breaks new ground with respect to performance of power amplifiers Using it you can be assured that any distortion that you hear is from other sources  This is what I look for in highend audio absolutely the best performance so no second guessing is involved You buy once and you are happy foreverAll of this comes from a company that is a model of transparency with proper and accurate measurements of their products on their site And importantly volunteering to have that data shown to be correct by independent sources such as us Support form the company for me at least has also been exceptionalYes 3000 is fair bit of money but is pocket change in highend audio Sales tax is higher than 3000 for most of those products I hear a lot of talk from audiophiles to have the equipment get out of the way of enjoying the music Well the Benchmark AHB2 at levels that assuredly passes full transparency So if that is your moto you better stop buying boutique products with no specs and independent measurements and get an AHB2 Everything you hear then will be what is in your source not the dirty dishes that your amp my serve your food onNeedless to say the Benchmark AHB2 gets my strongest recommendation for power amplifier The pink panther agrees having hit the ball out of the park after I took that shot
