0,I used my  system  to measure the Octave V 40 SE After installing the four KT88 output tubes per the setup sheet and before doing any measurements I let the amplifier warm up for a morning I then checked the bias voltage for the KT88s using the frontpanel rotary switch and the LED display All four LEDs illuminated green which according to the excellent owners manual means Setting is OK I took a complete set of measurements with the amplifier used alone then repeated most of the testing with the auxiliary Black Box capacitor bank connectedThe maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same with or without the Black Box outboard capacitance bank at 3875dB and the V 40 SE preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was at 615k ohms usefully higher than the specified 50k ohms and was still 51k ohms at the top of the audioband The output impedance is specified as 2 ohms however the measured impedance was significantly higher than this at 33 ohms at 20Hz 43 ohms at 1kHz and 38 ohms at 20kHz I was surprised that these measured impedances were not lowered by the Black BoxWith these high outputimpedance values the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker resulting from the Ohms law interaction between the amplifiers output impedance and the manner in which the load impedance varies with frequency reached ±21dB  The two channels matched very closely in the audioband into 8 ohms  though the left channel rolled off a little earlier above 20kHz The ultrasonic rolloff is very fast and there is a sign of a slight peak developing between 30 and 50kHz in the right channel into lower impedances  This correlates with some critically damped overshoot—one halfcycle of overshoot and no ringing—with a 10kHz squarewave Fig1 Octave V 40 SE frequency response with volume control at its maximum at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Octave V 40 SE smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was modest at 65dB below 1kHz and just 38dB in both directions at 20kHz  I measure an integrated amplifiers signalnoise ratio in the worstpossible case with its input shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum The wideband unweighted ratio under these conditions ref 283V or 1W into 8 ohms and with the Black Box connected was 776dB in the left channel and 785dB in the right The ratios improved to 799 and 843dB respectively when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 842 and 87dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the V 40 SEs output while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms  revealed that the left channels slightly poorer noise performance was due to a higher level of 60Hz in that channel though at –83dB  this wont be audibleFig3 Octave V 40 SE spectrum of 1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms DC–1kHz The V 40 SEs maximum output power is specified at 40Wpc into 4 ohms  Figs 4 and 5 plot the THDnoise percentage in the amplifiers output against output power into 8 and 4 ohms respectively We define clipping as when the THDN reaches 1 and these two graphs indicate that into both impedances the Octave clips at 265W  Adding the Black Box didnt increase the power at clipping However the V 40 SE reaches its specified power into 4 ohms at 112 THDN and the THDN is still just 118 at 50Wpc into 4 ohms  which is when the amplifier starts to hard clip  Below 50W the THDN rises linearly with increasing power this due to the low level of loop negative feedback usedFig4 Octave V 40 SE distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Octave V 40 SE distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe distortion below 1W is low especially into higher impedances Fig6 plots the percentage of THDN against frequency at 283V into 8 4 and 2 ohms The distortion rises at the frequency extremes as expected from the circuit topology but only into 2 ohms  does it become problematically high Fortunately the distortion content at low powers is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic even into low impedances  though it is joined at higher powers by some highorder harmonics  Highfrequency intermodulation distortion  was what Id expected from the Octaves THDvsfrequency behavior with the 1kHz difference component—resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10Wpc into 8 ohms—reaching –50dB  There is a peculiar rise in the powersupply–rated spuriae in the midtreble in this graph which was taken with the Black Box connected Disconnecting the Black Box didnt change this behavior nor did experimenting with all the various ways of grounding the amplifier to the Audio Precision test systemFig6 Octave V 40 SE THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8

10W into 8 ohms Fig9 Octave V 40 SE HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms Other than that anomaly Octaves V 40 SE measured as I would expect from a traditional design that uses a pair of KT88 output tubes for each channel And like Octaves RE 290 a 100Wpc power amplifier favorably reviewed by Erick Lichte in our January 2013 issue the V 40 SE is constructed to an impressively high standard
