XTZ A2300 class D amplifier costs US 500 company direct It based BO ICE 300ASC newer name 300A1While wont mistake enclosure A2300 highend custom design enough extra touches set typical DIY type casesThere nice looking vents side Note however heat centralized center bottom panel typical class D amp modules In use though bottom barely got warm although I could smell heat generation side ventsI disappointed see balanced inputsThe gain potentiometer make unit flexible typically good reliability Since controls dont get used often tend go bad If buy unit sure turn control left right monthsBinding posts substantial I likedXTZ A2300 MeasurementsAs usual start dashboard 5 watts 4 ohmAs noted I adjusted gain control give roughly 29 dB standard value I use testing Distortion fairly low 98 dB enough noise cost 10 dB bit channel This makes SINAD still averageAs noted noise somewhat issue see signal noise ratioNotice one channel 35 dB worse otherI bit disappointed see frequency response impacted simple resistive load showing peaking around 20 kHzMore complex speaker loads may make worse Crosstalk OKHere power level versus distortionnoise 4 ohmWe see noise differential distortion differential well Power way short 300 watts Letting distortion rise 1 spec calls still shy thatSo definitely conservatively rated8 ohm load naturally produces lot less powerTypical ICE modules dont behave evenly across frequency rangeThat quite variation distortion noise relative power In sense previous tests using 1 kHz representative total performanceConclusionsI started review liking enclosure But got bit jaded unbalanced inputs higher expected noise level high frequency dependency frequency response distortionnoise Then performance still average compared many amplifiers I tested This produced quandary I could recommend justify At end I decided recommend without strong feelings one way You data decide
