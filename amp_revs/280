0, Wyred4Sound mINT integrated stereo amplifier and DAC   costs US 1499 from the company I see reviews dating back to 2013 so the box has been around for a whileThe design goes with the rest of Wyred4Sound gear although in person looks less refined than I expect in this price rangeThe back panel shows some very good functionality such as triggers and home theater pass throughThe overall package is small and convenient from that point of view It ran reasonably cool which was also niceAs I took this picture I realized USB only goes up to 96 kHz which is the old school USB interfaces of the time Fortunately it is asynchronous which was novel at the time and could have been worse in the form of synchronous USBWyred4Sound mINT MeasurementsWhen I first powered on the unit the measurements were low so to make sure it was not my setup I took the time to route all cables separately tightened all the connections and performance seemingly improved But this morning I got up and thought maybe the box was warming up and changes had nothing to do with the wires so ran my standard warmup testLooks like my guess was correct The amp did not stabilize even after 7 minutes of running with load on I waited at least that long before I took the measurements you see below so represents the warmer side of things With amplifiers with both digital and analog inputs I always have to determine which input is best which depends on topology of the amp So lets do that here first using Aux In analog inputI tried hard to suppress that mains noise at 60 Hz but every change made it worse I then switched to USB inputMan this is bad It should be a walk in the park to have DAC that keeps up with an amp that has a SINAD of 77 dB but here we are with one of the worst performances I have seen with digital input So lets continue with analog input for the rest of the tests starting with our SINAD ratingSo below average and disappointing Even more disappointing is the high noise floorCrosstalk is fineFrequency response unfortunately shows variability which means the class D amp used doesnt use a feedback loop outside of its filter to remove that dependencyAssuming you have good high frequency sensitivity this amplifier will sound different with different speakersWe see that distortion sets in early and rises a lotHere is our peak and max power at 1 THDSweeping different frequencies shows reasonable response for a class D but not in generalConclusionsI very much like the functionality of the mINT with cute small size Performance though is subpart and much better can be done than what we have here with discrete parts which may cost even less than this comboSo I cant recommend the Wyred4Sound mINT But if you are fond of the functionality I am not going to chase you out of the room
