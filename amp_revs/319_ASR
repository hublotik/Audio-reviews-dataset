Audio Research Corporation 1002 stereo power amplifier The 1002 came year 1998 cost US 2995 It later raised US 3495 If I remember correctly owner told last solid state amplifier ARC produces going tube routeThe 1002 solid rockThe back panel expect exception speaker binding postsIn use 1002 cooked cooked good I measured 45 47 degrees C heatsinks The internal temps likely much higher I read uses unobtanium output MOSFET transistors go likely giant door stop In use though 1002 complain one bit ran testsStrangely power unit takes What I dont knowThe design unit based low feedback factor 6 dB Based alone I tell going perform wellAmplifier Audio MeasurementsWe huge power supply peaks like due poor power supply rejection ratio low feedback design Second third harmonic dominate distortion profile resulting lackluster SINAD 65 dB That lands ARC 1002 near bottom 72 amplifiers tested farFrequency response excellentResponse changes simulated 2way speaker load nothing cry overMultitone test shows high distortion products power supplyAnd rather high noise floor directly measure using signal noise ratioCrosstalk shape odd audible concernAmplifier Power MeasurementsThe sins low feedback factor stare face 4 ohm loadYes distortion gradually increases clips anyway So clean power clippingSame deal 8 ohmsAt least slightly exceeds power specificationsStrangely burst power doesnt generate much powerKeeping THDN constant 01 gives us incredibly low strange amount powerThere much distortion noise output amp dont get much power set goal 01 THD FYI I ran 02 THDN produced 80 watts straight line Anyway says class D amps trouble testAmplifier Thermal stabilityI powered unit cold let run nearly half hour recording distortion noise This I gotThat high degree improvement Again low feedback means sensitive operating temperature Given high heat dissipation tough deal also keep unit get best performanceConclusionsSigh The best analogy I think car owners said know car square tires manufacturers running build cars way Yes audio folklore says feedback bad thing Well I news distortion really really bad thing As noise It surely doesnt give blacker background higher noise itI read place less feedback deliver less phase shift Do folks know reflections room every one arrives ears different delay hence phase That mix result brain discards info If would go crazy trying make sense people talking us indoor situations Anyway digressNeedless say I cannot recommend ARC 1002 Serviceability poor performance
