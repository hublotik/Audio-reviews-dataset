0, Cary SI3002d   Usually I precondition an amplifier by running it with both channels driven at onethird power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes After just 20 minutes however the temperature of the Carys internal heatsink which can be touched was 1928°F  that of the top panel just behind the faceplate was 1206°F  After another 20 minutes the SI3002d turned off its outputs and PROTECT appeared on its display I let the amplifier cool down then turned it back on and continued testing But the Carys heatsinking is smaller than it theoretically needs to be for an amplifier capable of delivering 300Wpc into 8 ohmsLooking first at the performance of the SI3002d via its analog inputs The volume control operated in accurate 1dB steps and the voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum measured 307dB for both balanced and unbalanced input signals this increasing by 4dB rather than the specified 6dB when I pressed the Mode button on the remote control The preamplifier outputs appeared to be just under unity gain sourced from a highish 895 ohms The unbalanced inputs were noninverting but the balanced inputs appeared to be wired with pin 3 rather than pin 2 hot as they inverted absolute polarity The unbalanced input impedance across the audioband was 23k ohms the balanced impedance twice that value as expectedThe Carys output impedance  was 013 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 018 ohm at 20kHz The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker was fairly low at ±01dB  This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum of 60 there was no difference in the performance with the control set to 40 and as the Carys response was down by 3dB at 110kHz its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was excellent with relatively short risetimes Fig1 Cary SI3002d frequency response with volume control set to its maximum at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Cary SI3002d smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation below 1kHz was good rather than great at 70dB but at 20kHz decreased to 46dB L–R and 50dB R–L Spectral analysis of the SI3002ds lowfrequency noise floor  revealed the presence of both odd and evenorder harmonics of the 60Hz AC supply frequency but as these lay at or below 100dB below 1W into 8 ohms they will be inconsequential The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio ref that level taken with the inputs shorted to ground but the volume set to its maximum was a respectable 803dB improving to 926dB when AweightedFig3 Cary SI3002d spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Carys SI3002d exceeded its specified maximum power of 300Wpc into 8 ohms  clipping  at 337W with both channels driven into 8 ohms  The specified maximum power into 4 ohms is 450Wpc  but the measured clipping power into this load was 500Wpc  I didnt test the clipping power into 2 ohms as a burst of ultrasonic noise appeared on the tops and bottoms of the waveform at high powers into this load and I was concerned about breaking the amplifierFig4 Cary SI3002d THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Cary SI3002d THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFigs 4 and 5 reveal that the THDN was respectably low at powers below 10W and even at a higher power remained below 01 into 8 ohms across the audioband  with the right channel driving 4 ohms  The left channel was less linear than the right into low impedances and above 2kHz or so however The residual distortion waveform  implies a complicated mix of second and third harmonics and spectral analysis reveals that higherorder harmonics are also present at higher powers  Intermodulation distortion was relatively low  with the difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying 70dB below the signals peak level Fig6 Cary SI3002d THDN  vs frequency at 179V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Cary SI3002d 1kHz waveform at

spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms Turning to the SI3002ds digital inputs a 1kHz tone at 0dBFS resulted in a level from the preamplifier output of 1873V with the volume control set to its maximum and 5795V from the speaker outputs into 8 ohms However as the power amplifier was clipping slightly at this level it appears that the digital inputs gain architecture is close to optimal As the Carys speaker outputs cant be turned off I reduced the volume control by 10dB for the rest of the digitalinput testing and disconnected the test load from the speaker outputs to avoid damaging the amplifier with fullscale digital signals All of the digital test results refer to the signal at the Carys preamplifier outputAs well as the Audio Precisions digital outputs I used WAV and AIFF testtone files sourced via USB from Pure Music 30 on my MacBook Pro computer running on battery power Apples USB Prober utility identified the Cary as xCORE USB Audio 20 from XMOS and revealed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode Apples AudioMIDI utility showed that via USB the SI3002d accepted 24bit integer data sampled at all rates from 441 to 384kHzThe Cary offers a wide range of upsampling options but not with USB data which is what I use to examine a DACs impulse response and wideband spectral analyses  The SI3002ds impulse response with 441kHz data  reveals the reconstruction filter to be a minimumphase type Wideband spectral analysis with 441kHz white noise at –4dBFS  shows this filter to have the expected sharp cutoff above 20kHz and the distortion harmonics of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  are all low in levelFig10 Cary SI3002d impulse response Fig11 Cary SI3002d wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz When Carys frequency response with TosLink and AESEBU data and with and without upsampling I uncovered some problems Fig12 shows the responses without upsampling and with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHz while the 441kHz response drops sharply above 18kHz the response at all three rates rolls off a little early in the top audio octave and the ultrasonic response with 192kHz data extends no higher than with 96kHz data Switching in PCM upsampling didnt change these responses  but when I looked at the effect of DSD upsampling it didnt matter whether I chose DSD64 DSD128 or DSD256—the original PCM data appeared to be first downsampled to 441kHz This is shown graphically in fig14 where the blue and red traces plot the response with 96kHz data upsampled to 384kHz the cyan and magenta traces the response with the same 96kHz data upsampled to DSD256Fig12 Cary SI3002d no upsampling frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz

depth drops the noise floor by around 27dB suggesting DAC resolution of between 20 and 21 bits which is excellent The Carys reproduction of an undithered 16bit1kHz tone at exactly –9031dBFS  clearly shows the three DC voltage levels described by the data as well as the minimumphase behavior of the reconstruction filter Switching in upsampling gave a waveform more typical of a timesymmetrical FIR

tones peaking at 0dBFS the result were also anomalous Fig18 shows the spectrum with 441kHz data and upsampling bypassed Intermodulation products are all low in level but there is some modulation of the noise floor around the tones By contrast fig19 shows the spectrum with the same data upsampled to 3528kHz The noisefloor modulation has disappeared but some higherorder products are now present And with DSD128 upsampling the spectrum is just perverse Fig18 Cary SI3002d no upsampling HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms 441kHz data Fig19 Cary SI3002d 3528kHz

441kHz data The spectrum of the SI3002ds rejection of wordclock jitter with 441Hz JTest data and upsampling bypassed  shows the same modulation of the noise floor as in the intermodulation tests This obscures the offorder harmonics of the lowfrequency LSBlevel squarewave other than a pair to either side of the spike representing the 11025kHz tone There is also a pair of sidebands present at ±38kHz in the left channel only Neither these sidebands nor the noisefloor modulation was present when I repeated the test with USB data  but the sidebands remained when I upsampled TosLink data to 3528kHz  or repeated the test with 24bit data Fig21 Cary SI3002d no upsampling highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit

is a mixed bag The amplifier itself is a straightforward competently engineered solidstate classAB design and while its heatsinking is in absolute terms inadequate for so powerful an amplifier this will probably not be a problem in practical use unless the Cary is used for dancing at a party Its USB input offers excellent performance as KM found However with SPDIF and AESEBU data and upsampling which KM didnt audition some of the measurements were perverse—see the Bryston review elsewhere in this issue for how these measurements should look—while others suggested that the sound will change somewhat arbitrarily depending on the input sample rate andor on which upsampling rate andor format have been chosen
