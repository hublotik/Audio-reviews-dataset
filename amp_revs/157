0,The Technics SUG700M2 appears to be a less powerful less–wellequipped sibling of the Technics SUR1000 integrated amplifier that KM reviewed in December 2021 which offered superb measured performance  SUG700M2  and as the amplifier has an output stage that resembles classD I inserted an Audio Precision AUX0025 passive lowpass filter between the test load and the analyzer This filter reduces RF noise that would otherwise drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slewrate limiting  I used the filter for all the loudspeaker output tests other than frequency responseI looked first at the Technicss performance via its singleended line inputs The SUG700M2 preserved absolute polarity at all outputs with Phase set to Normal The volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps and the maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 42dB  At the preamplifier output the gain was 213dB and at the headphone output it was 267dB The SUG700M2s power amplifier stage can be accessed separately It offered a fixed gain of 324dB The input impedance at both the line inputs and the power amplifier inputs was 32k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz with an inconsequential drop to 283k ohms at 20kHzThe Technics amplifiers output impedance at the headphone output was a relatively high 66 ohms At the preamplifier output it ranged from 781 ohms at 20Hz to 707 ohms at 20kHz It was difficult to measure the output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals due to an increase in ultrasonic noise with no load connected even with the Audio Precision lowpass filter in circuit But the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between the SUG700M2s source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was a low ±025dB in the bass and midrange  which implies that the output impedance including the series impedance of 6 of spacedpair loudspeaker cable must have been close to a low 01 ohmFig1 Technics SUG700M2 volume control set to –12dB frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  extended to 70kHz but rolled off rapidly above that frequency With a 4 ohm resistive load  the output started to roll off slowly in the top audio octave reaching –3dB at 45kHz Into 2 ohms  the output was down by 3dB at 20kHz presumably due to an increase in output impedance in the top audio octave This graph was taken with the volume control set to –12dB The excellent channel matching was preserved at other settings of the controlLike the SUR1000 the SUG700M2 has the LAPC function which is intended to compensate for the dependence of a loudspeakers impedance with frequency I bypassed LAPC for these measurements but its effect can be seen in fig2 in the SUR1000s measurementsFig2 Technics SUG700M2 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThere is a small critically damped overshoot in the Technicss reproduction of a 10kHz squarewaves leading edges into 8 ohms  The absence of Nyquistfrequency ringing from an antialiasing filter suggests either that the SUG700M2 doesnt digitize its analog inputs or that the output stages lowpass filter removes the ringing meaning that the AD converter operates at 192kHz Its tone controls offer a maximum boost and cut of close to 8dB Fig3 Technics SUG700M2 frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to 0 and set to ±10 and with midrange set to ±10 Channel separation was good at 75dB in both directions With the auxiliary lowpass filter and the amplifier loaded with 8 ohms its inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum there was still 330mV of ultrasonic noise present in its outputs The SUG700M2s unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was therefore just 185dB ref 283V in both channels Audio Precision though recommends using a brickwall filter such as the AES17 filter included on the AP 2720 when testing noise in classD amplifiers When that filter was employed the signalnoise ratio improved to 646dB Aweighted the SN ratio was 677dBSpuriae at the supply frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics were present in the amplifiers output their levels depended on the setting of the volume control The blue and red traces in fig4 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum Reducing the volume by 20dB significantly lowered the levels of both the supplyrelated spuriae and random noise Fig4 Technics SUG700M2 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms volume control set to maximum  and to –20dB Technics specifies the SUG700M2s maximum power as 70Wpc into 8 ohms and 140Wpc into 4 ohms both powers at 05 THD and both equivalent to 1845dBW We specify clipping power as when the THDnoise reaches 1 By that measure and with both channels driven the Technics amplifier clipped at 80Wpc into 8 ohms  and 148Wpc into 4 ohms  I didnt test clipping power into 2 ohms as the amplifier isnt specified into that loadFig5 Technics SUG700M2 volume control set to –12dB distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Technics SUG700M2 volume control set to –12dB distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe distortion is low at low powers so I examined how the THDN varied with frequency at 1265V equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms and 40W into 4 ohms  To prevent the residual ultrasonic noise from contaminating the THDN reading I used an additional brickwall lowpass filter set to 40kHz This filter affected the THDN reading for signals above 5kHz but the distortion is very similar into both 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  at close to 005Fig7 Technics SUG700M2 volume control set to –12dB THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion waveform at this output voltage  suggested the presence of highorder harmonics This was confirmed by spectral analysis  The fifth harmonic in both channels the seventh harmonic in the left channel  and the ninth harmonic in the right channel  were almost as high in level as the second and third harmonics Although these harmonics are low in level lying between –80dB  and –70dB  they could be audible at high listening levels in the region where the ear is most sensitive Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 20W peak into 8 ohms the intermodulation distortion products all lay at or below –80dB  At the same output voltage into 4 ohms  the higherorder products were slightly lower in level but the secondorder difference product at 1kHz rose to –74dB Fig8 Technics SUG700M2 volume control set to –12dB 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms 0043

ohms I looked at the Technics SUG700M2s digitalinput performance using its SPDIF inputs then repeated some of the tests with the USB input The SUG700M2s optical input locked to SPDIF data sampled up to 96kHz the coaxial input to data sampled up to 192kHz Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that the USB inputs accepted 24 and 32bit integer data sampled at rates up to 7056kHz  Apples USB Prober utility confirmed that the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous modeThe Technicss digital inputs all preserved absolute polarity With the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at –40dBFS resulted in a level at the preamplifier output of 2569mV at the headphone output of 4808mV and at the loudspeaker outputs of 277V The latter voltage implies that digital data at 0dBFS will drive the amplifier into clipping For the digital input measurements therefore I used the Menu to activate the –20dB inputattenuator setting Even so digital data at 0dBFS caused the amplifier to turn off after briefly showing the message F76 on its frontpanel display The manual explains that this message means that An abnormality has occurred  The protection circuit is activated and the power may be turned off automatically To avoid damaging the power amplifier stage with highlevel digital data digital inputs behavior at the headphone output which mutes the loudspeaker outputThe impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the linearphase filters response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression at 24kHz just above half the sample rate  The aliased image at 25kHz of a 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  is suppressed by 90dB and the highestlevel distortion harmonic of the 191kHz tone the third lay just below –70dB  The digitalinput frequency response was flat in the audioband then rolled off sharply above half of each sample rate  The levels of the two channels matched perfectlyFig12 Technics SUG700M2 digital inputs impulse response Fig13 Technics SUG700M2 digital inputs

100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz   ultimate resolution of the SUG700M2s digital inputs I disabled the 20dB attenuation set the volume control to its maximum and examined the spectrum at the headphone output with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16 and 24bit data  There was no reduction in the noisefloor with 24bit data which implies that the SUG700M2 offers 16 bits worth of resolution The reason for this limited resolution can be seen in fig16 which shows the waveform of a tone at exactly –9031dBFS with undithered 16bit data Although the headphone amplifier is analog the three DC voltage levels described by the data are completely obscured by highfrequency noise presumably radiated from the switching output stage With undithered 24bit data  what should have been a relatively clean sinewave was again obscured by highfrequency noise It should be noted however that the noise is above the audiobandFig15 Technics SUG700M2 digital inputs volume control set to

Technics amplifiers digital inputs  was low the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lying at –84dB  in the left channel and –93dB  in the right While the higherorder products were higher in level they were at or below –70dB  SUG700M2 for its rejection of wordclock jitter via its TosLink and USB inputs using 16 and 24bit JTest data sampled at 441kHz All the oddorder harmonics of the 16bit JTest signals LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were close to the correct levels  though some modulation of the noisefloor is evident As expected from fig16 the 24bit noisefloor  was no lower in level than that in fig18Fig18 Technics SUG700M2 digital inputs with 20dB attenuation active and volume control set to another –6dB highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS

±35kHzTurning to the SUG700M2s phono input I followed the manuals advice to connect a separate ground wire from the terminal on the amplifiers chassis to the ground of the Audio Precision analyzer I primarily examined the phono inputs behavior at the headphone output again to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stages with highlevel signalsThe Technicss phono input preserved absolute polarity in both moving magnet and moving coil modes Set to MM the phono input had a maximum gain of 577dB at the preamp outputs 631dB at the headphone outputs and 784dB at the speaker outputs Set to MC the phono inputs maximum gains were 787dB 841dB and 994dB respectively These values mean that clipping is possible at the outputs with highlevel phono signals so it would be best to use the optional 20dB attenuation The phono inputs input impedance set to MC mode was an appropriate 120 ohms across the audioband set to MM the input impedance was 39k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz falling to 32k ohms at 20kHzThe SUG700M2s RIAA correction  was wellmatched between the channels with a slight downward shelf in the treble The switchable subsonic filter  rolled off the response by 6dB at 20Hz The MM phono inputs unweighted wideband SN ratio measured with the input shorted to ground and with the volume control set to –6dB was 356dB  referred to an input signal of 1kHz at 5mV This low ratio was due to the presence of ultrasonic noise presumably radiated from the switching output stage restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased the ratio to an excellent 84dB while switching an Aweighting filter into circuit further increased the ratio to 883dB The MC inputs ratios were 14–16dB lower due to this modes higher gainFig20 Technics SUG700M2 phono input response with RIAA correction into 100k ohms  and with subsonic filter  The Technics phono inputs overload margins measured with the volume control set to –30dB to avoid clipping the headphone output were usefully high from 20Hz to 20kHz at 169dB ref 1kHz at 5mV MM and 169dB ref 1kHz at 500µV MC The phono stages distortion was very low with all the harmonics at or below –80dB  Highorder intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak input level equivalent to 1kHz at 5mV lay at –70dB  with the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lying at –84dB Fig21 Technics SUG700M2 MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz into 100k ohms for 5mV input While the SUG700M2 meets its specified power and has a phono input that offers respectable measured performance especially in its high overload margins the contamination of the analog phono stage and headphone outputs with ultrasonic noise and the highorder harmonics in the outputs were disappointing
