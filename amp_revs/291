0, Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 Stereo Class D power amplifier It was kindly sent to me by  costs US 799 The GaN 5 comes in a compact enclosure with plenty of ventilation at the cost of decent looksBeside the sole power button and blue indicator there are two red LEDs that turn on when you power the unit on and then go off Strangely when the amplifier goes into protection they do not light up and getting the unit working again requires a power cycle I like to see protection circuits that self recover when the extreme condition goes awayThe back panel shows binding posts that are too close together for easy fitment of my large banana speaker cables But I like the inclusion of balanced XLR inputsAs you see there are also jumpers to change the gain setting although the range is not very large  Most of my testing was with medium gain which is as shippedI had trouble getting the amplifier to function initially It would simply not output anything I played with grounding as I have seen some very low end amps cause AP to not be able to capture their output due to high level of noise  This didnt work at first so I switched inputs to RCA That did not work either After some fiddling and switching back to balanced input the amp all of a sudden started to work Not sure how much of this is interaction with Audio Precision or design issue Either way it is an exception to the rule of 95 of amplifiers I have measuredAs the name indicates this amplifier uses the new Gallium Nitride transistors  which has some advantages over classic Mosfet transistors All else being equal it can produce higher efficiency and better performance at expense of higher costMini GaN 5 MeasurementsAs noted I started my testing in medium gain which produced near nominal 29 dB which is my standard for amplifiers XLR input was used per introductionWell this is disappointing Distortion is fairly high causing SINAD which is the sum of distortionnoise to be worse than a number of budget desktop amplifiersNoise performance by itself is not good eitherI had trouble getting the amplifier to go to full power for the right graph It would shut down at just 07 volt input Strangely later on it accepted higher levels of input I think the impulse nature of this measurement was causing it trouble So maybe it can produce higher SNR at higher power but still none of this is competitiveOn the other hand crosstalk was very goodMultitone performance was also reasonableWhat is not reasonable is high dependence on speaker load when it comes to frequency responseThis is just not proper Clearly the output filter is interacting with the loadPower measurements were quite puzzlingNotice the pull back due to some protection kicking in likely the power supply rather than the amplifier I could not remotely get the power rating they specify using medium gain I thought maybe low gain does better but then the pull back occurred at even low power  Beside lack of power distortion is also quite high for this price class and category We are talking about poor AudioVideo Receiver amplifier performanceSwitching to 8 ohm tamed the output a bit but power shortfall is still significantThis being the second amplifier I have recently tested with such power shortfall I started to doubt my instrumentation So I pulled out my Purifi reference design and measured it It tracked the dashed line in the above graph from a year ago 100 Someone had posted this from their website600 watts per channel Into 8 ohm This is the spec from the manualHow on earth did they measure 600 watts when the spec is 200 watts Strangely that graph is nowhere to be found on their site There is some talk about a larger amplifier of which is a shrunk version Maybe that is the one that produced higher power but why does it say mini in the title of above graphFYI this amplifier has the green board which I understand to be the newer design Maybe the older red one had more power Hard to sayAnyway I tried to run my max and burst powerIn Burst mode the amplifier would keep going into pull back and so I could not compute anything for that Likewise the THDN vs frequency and power could not be run As the frequencies got lower and lower the point where the amp would pull back would also shrink to lower and lower wattages  What I could get did not show great transfer functionConclusionsWhile I leave the door ever so slightly ajar to some interaction with Audio Precision the measurements seem to indicate an amplifier that has both design issues and inability to meet specifications The fact that the company took away the only measurement graph makes it suspect that maybe they had have modified the design and selling something different than what they originally intended As it is it is a waste of GaN technology as it brings nothing to the party but high expenseI cant recommend the Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 amplifier
