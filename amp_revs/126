0, using  system  As the Theta Prometheus has a switching output stage that produces ultrasonic noise that would overload the Audio Precisions input circuitry I carried out most of the tests using ahead of the analyzer an Audio Precision AUX0025 passive lowpass filter Usually before measuring an amplifier I run it for an hour at onethird power into 8 ohms—the most thermally stressful condition for a classB output stage But as the Prometheus has a classD output that preconditioning is irrelevant Even so I subjected serial number 050085 to this test to ensure that it had settled into its longterm operating condition The Thetas voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same at 277dB for its balanced and unbalanced inputs and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity for both inputs  its XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot At 90k ohms the balanced input impedance was very close to the specification of 94k ohms at low and middle frequencies though it dropped to 84k ohms at the top of the audioband The unbalanced input impedance was half these valuesThe Prometheuss output impedance was 011 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly at 20kHz to 013 ohm The modification of the Thetas frequency response which results from the interaction between this impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was very low  This graph also shows that the ultrasonic rolloff doesnt change significantly as the load impedance drops to 2 ohms with a –3dB point of 40kHz However a small peak at 77kHz becomes a little more pronounced into higher impedances Without the Audio Precision lowpass filter the Thetas reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms is obscured by switching noise  With the filter however this noise is eliminated  and a 10kHz squarewave can be seen to have a small degree of overshoot that correlates with the slight response peak at 77kHz  Commendably however no ringing is associated with this overshootFig1 Theta Prometheus frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Theta Prometheus smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms without AP LPFFig3 Theta Prometheus smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with AP LPFWithout the Audio Precision lowpass filter and with the Thetas input shortcircuited there was 321mV of ultrasonic noise present in the amplifiers output with a center frequency of 453kHz With the filter the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 283V into 8 ohms was 763dB this improving to an excellent 94dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband—and improving even more to 956dB when the measurement was Aweighted With the amplifier passing signal however there was the noise level depended to some extent on the output power Fig5 taken with the auxiliary AP lowpass filter   shows lowfrequency spectra of the Thetas output while it reproduced a 1kHz tone at 1W  then 100W  into 8 ohms Spuriae are present at the ACrelated frequency of 60Hz and its odd harmonics which increase with the power level This behavior usually suggests magnetic interference from the amplifiers power transformer but as the spuriae are still all at or below –110dB  at the high power their presence will be of only academic interestFig4 Theta Prometheus smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with AP LPFFig5 Theta Prometheus spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W  and 100W  into 8 ohms Fig6 reveals that the Thetas distortion starts to rise above the audioband noise floor just below 10W into 8 ohms but remains below a low 0003 until the start of actual waveform clipping Even then the rise in THD is relatively gradual and the amplifier doesnt reach 1 THD until 320W  just over 1dB higher than the rated 250W into 8 ohms  Into 4 ohms  the Prometheus delivers 600W  at 1 THD rather than the specified 500W though this graph shows that the amplifier is less linear below clipping into this load Into 2 ohms  the Theta still easily exceeded its specified maximum power of 850W delivering 980W  Fig6 Theta Prometheus distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 Theta Prometheus distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig8 Theta Prometheus distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsTo be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise I examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency at a fairly high level 20V equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms Fig9 reveals that the Prometheus is still very linear below the midtreble region at this level even into 4 ohms  However the distortion rises considerably into 2 ohms  and in the top two octaves into the higher impedances though it still remains below 008Fig9 Theta Prometheus THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Into 8 ohms at moderately high power the distortion is predominantly third harmonic  though at just 00024 this again will be of only academic interest As the current increases the third harmonic is joined by evenorder harmonics  but these are all at lower levels Intermodulation distortion is also very low even at high powers into 4 ohms  with the 1kHz difference product associated with tones at 19 and 20kHz lying 100dB below the peak signal level Fig10 Theta Prometheus 1kHz waveform at 60W into 8 ohms 00024 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig11 Theta Prometheus spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms Fig12 Theta Prometheus HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms The measured performance of Theta Digitals Prometheus is superb even for an amplifier with a classD output stage Its similar to that of the more expensive MBL Corona C15 monoblock which I reviewed in June 2014 which shouldnt be surprising—the MBL also uses a custom version of the Hypex output module designed by the very talented Bruno Putzeys
