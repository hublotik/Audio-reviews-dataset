0, Fosi Audio TB10D stereo amplifier  is only sale for US 70 on Amazon including shippingWe have the typical compact desktop aluminum case Controls feel nice for the class Tone controls are not centered however for flat response  Typical of these budget amplifiers power is provided externally through a switching supplyBinding posts are spaced out a bit more which made it easier for me to plug in my large cablesThis is a class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 single chip amplifierFosi Audio TB10D MeasurementsLets start with our usual 5 watts measurement of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm loadDominant distortion is third harmonic which essentially sets SINAD to same level This is slightly below average but considering the price of this amp it is reasonableKind of interesting that the 5900 Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier lands almost next to itSignal to noise ratio is modest but again good for the classCrosstalk holds its own against much more expensive amplifiersFrequency response is variable due to bass and treble control and load dependencyThe load dependency is the norm in this class Hopefully some amp comes along and with no cost penalty takes care of that Distortion rises with frequency which we can see in multitone testPower is everything in amplifiers so lets see how much we haveThis is quite healthy for such a small and low cost amplifier It gets even better if we allow 1 distortionWe are talking essentially 200 watts coming out of this little box Cost per watt is just 35 cents AmazingEven with 8 ohm load we get good amount of juiceAmplifier transfer function  is very good for class D although it does show rise in distortion as noted earlierOf note you still have 66 watts of power at 20 Hz Many budget amps drop to 20 or so watts which can be problem as bass is what requires powerConclusionsMaybe one day this will change for for now in under 100 range you cant expect perfection in performance of a stereo amplifier What you do want to see is delivering healthy amount of power with close to our average of all of our amplifiers tested to date On that front the Fosi Audio TB10D delivers If you need an amplifier for secondary use  the TB10D is a very good candidate for no more money than one or two dinnersI am going to recommend the Fosi Audio TB10D amplifier
