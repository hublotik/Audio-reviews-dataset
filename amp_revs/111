0, Musical Fidelity M8xi   I first preconditioned the amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the top panel was very warm at 1096°F  and the heatsinks were too hot to touch at 1621°F  I then started performing my usual thermal stress test by running the amplifier at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour However I cut the test short after 20 minutes as the top panels temperature was already 1181°F  and that of the heatsinks 1727°F  and I was concerned that I would damage the amplifier Despite the massive heatsinks along its sides the Musical Fidelity amplifier doesnt have quite enough thermal capacity for its power ratingI looked first at the Musical Fidelitys performance via its line inputs While the balanced inputs offered a maximum gain at the speaker outputs of 366dB into 8 ohms the unbalanced inputs offered a significantly higher 438dB Usually a singleended input offers 6dB lower gain than a balanced input The maximum gain at the variable preamplifier outputs was 1276dB balanced in to balanced out and 136dB unbalanced in to unbalanced out At the fixedlevel unbalanced line output the gain was 04dB for the singleended inputs and 724dB for the balanced inputs The amplifier preserved absolute polarity at all sets of outputs for both unbalanced and balanced input signals The volume control operates in accurate 05dB stepsThe singleended line input impedance met the specification at 25k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz though it dropped slightly to 21k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was lower than specified at 178k ohms across the audioband The preamplifier output impedance was an appropriately low 48 ohms singleended and 96 ohms balanced though the latter rose to 189 ohms in the low bassThe Musical Fidelitys output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was a little higher than usual for a solidstate design presumably due to the bridged output stage It measured 027 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 033 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was ±02dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was down by 3dB just above 100kHz which correlates with the Musical Fidelitys accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  Note that the very low bass in fig1 rolls off a little reaching –05dB at 20Hz and –15dB at 10Hz Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum neither the frequency response nor the excellent channel matching changed at lower settings of the volume controlFig1 Musical Fidelity M8xi analog input volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms   Fig2 Musical Fidelity M8xi analog input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was good at 80dB in both directions below 4kHz and still 67dB at the top of the audioband The Musical Fidelitys unweighted signalnoise ratio taken with the unbalanced line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control at its maximum setting of 1000 was a little disappointing at 559dB ref 283V into 8 ohms  This ratio improved to 643dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 67dB when Aweighted The level of the background noise which included spuriae at 60Hz and its even and oddorder harmonics depended on the setting of the volume control This can be seen in fig3 which shows the lowfrequency spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove 1kHz at 283V into 8 ohms with the volume control set to 1000  and to 800  Reducing the volume control setting by 20dB lowers the levels of the noisefloor components by around 13dBFig3 Musical Fidelity M8xi analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms volume control set to maximum  and to –20dB With both channels driven the M8xi didnt quite meet its specified maximum power into 8 ohms of 550Wpc  clipping  at 500Wpc  However I dont hold the wall AC voltage constant for the tests it measured 120V with the amplifier idle but dropped to 1162V when the amplifier was clipping into 8 ohms The Musical Fidelity clipped at 650Wpc into 4 ohms   Even with the volume control set to 90 the THDN reading was dominated by noise below a few tens of watts so I plotted how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The distortion was very low into 8 ohms  However it was higher into 4 ohms  and even more so into 2 ohms  though still below 01 across the audiobandFig4 Musical Fidelity M8xi analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Musical Fidelity M8xi analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Musical Fidelity M8xi analog input THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The distortion was predominantly the subjectively benign third harmonic  The volume control was set to its maximum for this measurement and even with 32 captures averaged the distortion waveform  was still overlaid with noise Higherorder harmonics are present at lower levels and the left channel had some second harmonic present  When the M8xi drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 30W into 8 ohms  highorder intermodulation products all lay below –76dB  and the secondorder difference product at 1kHz cant be seen above the noise floor even though I had the volume control set to 800 for this measurement to reduce the level of the noiseFig7 Musical Fidelity M8xi analog input 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00157 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Musical

Musical Fidelity M8xi has optical and coaxial SPDIF digital inputs as well as a USB port The coaxial inputs locked to data sampled up to 192kHz the optical inputs to sample rates up to 96kHz Apples USB Prober utility identified the Musical Fidelity as MF M8xi from Project The USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode and Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that the M8xi accepted 16 and 24bit integer data sampled at all rates from 441kHz to 192kHz The USB and SPDIF inputs all preserved absolute polarityWith the volume control set to 1000 a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in an output level of 3105V which is equivalent to 1205W into 8 ohms As my measured clipping power into 8 ohms was 500W which is equivalent to a voltage of 6325V it appears that the M8xis digital inputs have around 14dB too much gain The –20dBFS digital signal results in levels of 1908V at the balanced preamplifier output 9536mV at the unbalanced preamplifier output and 1911mV at the fixedlevel singleended line output To avoid damaging the Musical Fidelitys power amplifier stage with highlevel digital signals I performed all the measurements of the digital inputs performance at the fixedlevel outputs with the volume control set to 00The Musical Fidelitys impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the M8xis response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression just above half the sample rate  An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  cant therefore be seen though the distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor The third harmonic is the highest in level at just above –60dB  Peculiarly the 191kHz tone and its third and fifth harmonics are accompanied by lowlevel ±2kHz sidebands The M8xis digitalinput frequency response was flat in the audioband with then a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate Fig10 Musical Fidelity M8xi digital input impulse response Fig11 Musical Fidelity M8xi

with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Channel separation via the digital inputs was 100dB below 1kHz but crosstalk rose linearly to –75dB at the top of the audioband due to capacitive coupling between the channels When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor components dropped by around 15dB which implies that the M8xi offers between 18 and 19 bits worth of resolution However a large number of lowlevel powersupply–related spuriae were present in the noise floor With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS Fig13

inputs Though all the oddorder harmonics of the 16bit JTest signals LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were at the correct levels  the spectral spike that represents the highlevel tone at exactly onequarter the sample rate was significantly broadened at its base This suggests that the Musical Fidelitys digital inputs are affected by random lowfrequency jitter With 24bit JTest data  no jitterrelated sidebands were present but the spectral broadening could still be seenFig16 Musical Fidelity M8xi digital input highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS

power and low distortion Though its noise floor with the volume control set to its maximum was higher in level than I was expecting the amplifiers high gain especially with digital data and singleended analog input signals means that the volume control will never be used anywhere near its maximum
