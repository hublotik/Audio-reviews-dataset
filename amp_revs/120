big Chord SPM 14000 running 172W 8 ohms hour The measured THDnoise percentage beginning period 00108 After 20 minutes highorder components appeared distortion waveform still low level subsided 30minute mark final THD level 0015 almost pure third harmonic The rear heatsinks around 140°F end hour side panels cooler thisThe Chords voltage gain high 2975dB 8 ohms unbalanced balanced drive Neither lefthand input jacks inverted signal polarity righthand jacks Given two RCA jacks wired opposite polarity might thought inserting shorting plug unused jack would give lowest possible noise unbalanced drive When I tried however amplifier turned offThe unbalanced input impedance usefully high 52k ohms bass midrange dropping slightly 20kHz 35k ohms The balanced input impedance constant 104k ohms across audioband The output impedance including 6 speaker cable taken one pairs WBT binding posts I assumed parallel—the amps terminal panel devoid legends—was 023 ohm audio frequencies This resulted moderate ±025dB frequencyresponse modification standard dummy loudspeaker The Chords smallsignal bandwidth wide highfrequency –3dB point 111kHz correlating excellent 10kHz squarewave

unbalanced signals With balanced drive I measured moderate signalnoise ratio 642dB ref 1W 8 ohms This wideband unweighted figure Aweighted ratio good 793dB However unbalanced drive Aweighted ratio decreased slightly 763dB unweighted wideband figure significantly worse balanced 4975dB This I assumed undriven inverting RCA jack shorting plug inserted balanced amplifiers require unused signal phase referenced ground But I wrote earlier Chord went protection I tried As PB didnt remark issues background noise I assume used VTL TL75 preamplifiers balanced outputs feed SPM 14000sTo surprise though Chord definitely powerhouse amplifier didnt quite meet specified power clipping Into 8 ohms I measured 525W almost 3dB specified power 1kW 1dB less I earlier understood specified power 700W The shortfall probably insignificant opinion though I check repeating measurement next day amplifier cold rather hot It also relevant note I dont hold AC wall supply constant Variac power testing With signal wall voltage test lab 125V dropped still high 121V amplifier clipping 8 ohms 119V clipping 4 ohms 117V 2 ohms The 4 ohm clipping power 980W 2 ohm power 1450W —as I said amplifier still powerhouseThe manner distortion percentage changes output power shown fig3 The downward slopes traces tens watts graph indicate THDN percentage dominated noise levels Only deliveries 80W 8 4 ohms Chords true distortion start rise background noise Into 2 ohms however THD rises 30W suggests amplifier working hard load Even THD remains well 01 almost working power rangeFig3 Chord SPM 14000 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 8 4 2 ohmsBecause low level true THD smallsignal levels I plotted Chords THDN frequency 20V output equivalent 50W 8 ohms The results shown fig4 The 8 ohm trace graph correlates result fig3 however 4 ohm 2 ohm traces significantly worse I idea due fact amplifier hot tests cooled considerably time I performed lowimpedance clipping measurements I end testing case amp tested breaks The THD rises audioband three loads presumably due decreasing gain margin ultrasonic frequencies rendering negative feedback less effective But THDN percentage well 001

wasnt surprised see Chord produce 1kHz difference component –70dB driving mix 19 20kHz tones 8 ohms close visible clipping oscilloscope Halving load impedance didnt change level 1kHz product change
