0, big Chord SPM 14000 by running it at 172W into 8 ohms for an hour  The measured THDnoise percentage at the beginning of that period was 00108 After 20 minutes some highorder components appeared in the distortion waveform still at a very low level but these subsided at the 30minute mark with the final THD level at 0015 this almost pure third harmonic The rear heatsinks were around 140°F  at the end of the hour the side panels cooler than thisThe Chords voltage gain was a high 2975dB into 8 ohms this the same for both unbalanced and balanced drive Neither of the lefthand input jacks  inverted signal polarity both of the righthand jacks did so  Given that the two RCA jacks are wired with opposite polarity it might be thought that inserting a shorting plug into the unused jack would give the lowest possible noise with unbalanced drive When I tried that however the amplifier turned itself offThe unbalanced input impedance was a usefully high 52k ohms in the bass and midrange this dropping slightly at 20kHz to 35k ohms The balanced input impedance was a constant 104k ohms across the audioband The output impedance including 6 of speaker cable and taken from one of the pairs of WBT binding posts which I assumed were in parallel—the amps terminal panel was devoid of any legends—was 023 ohm at all audio frequencies This resulted in a moderate ±025dB of frequencyresponse modification with our standard dummy loudspeaker  The Chords smallsignal bandwidth was wide with a highfrequency –3dB point of 111kHz correlating with the excellent 10kHz squarewave reproduction  But as also can be seen from fig1 the amplifiers bandwidth decreased with decreasing load impedance the output being 07dB down at 20kHz into 2 ohms This graph was taken using balanced drive the unbalanced set of responses was identicalFig1 Chord SPM 14000 balanced frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 4 2 ohms Fig2 Chord SPM 14000 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe level of the SPM 14000s noise floor depended on whether it was being driven by balanced or unbalanced signals With balanced drive I measured a moderate signalnoise ratio of 642dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This was a wideband unweighted figure the Aweighted ratio was a good 793dB However with unbalanced drive while the Aweighted ratio decreased only slightly to 763dB the unweighted wideband figure was significantly worse than balanced at 4975dB This was why I had assumed that the undriven inverting RCA jack should have a shorting plug inserted as some balanced amplifiers require the unused signal phase to be referenced to ground But as I wrote earlier the Chord went into protection when I tried this As PB didnt remark on any issues with background noise I assume he used the VTL TL75 preamplifiers balanced outputs to feed the SPM 14000sTo my surprise though the Chord is definitely a powerhouse of an amplifier it didnt quite meet its specified power at clipping  Into 8 ohms I measured 525W  which is almost 3dB below the specified power of 1kW and just over 1dB less than what I had earlier understood to be the specified power 700W  The shortfall is probably insignificant in my opinion though I did check by repeating the measurement the next day with the amplifier cold rather than hot  It is also relevant to note that I dont hold my AC wall supply constant with a Variac for my power testing With no signal the wall voltage in my test lab was 125V this dropped to a still high 121V with the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms 119V with it clipping into 4 ohms and 117V into 2 ohms The 4 ohm clipping power was 980W  the 2 ohm power 1450W —as I said the amplifier is still a powerhouseThe manner in which the distortion percentage changes with output power is shown in fig3 The downward slopes of the traces below a few tens of watts in this graph indicate that the THDN percentage is dominated by noise at these levels Only above deliveries of 80W or so into 8 and 4 ohms does the Chords true distortion start to rise above the background noise Into 2 ohms however the THD rises above 30W which suggests that the amplifier is working hard into this load Even so the THD remains well below 01 for almost all its working power rangeFig3 Chord SPM 14000 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsBecause of the very low level of true THD at smallsignal levels I plotted the Chords THDN against frequency at 20V output equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms The results are shown in fig4 The 8 ohm trace in this graph correlates with the result in fig3 however both the 4 ohm and 2 ohm traces are significantly worse I have no idea what these are due to other than the fact that the amplifier was very hot for these tests while it had cooled down considerably by the time I performed the lowimpedance clipping measurements which I do at the very end of the testing in case the amp being tested breaks The THD rises above the audioband into all three loads presumably due to the decreasing gain margin at ultrasonic frequencies rendering negative feedback less effective But again the THDN percentage is well below 001 in the audiobandFig4 Chord SPM 14000 THDN vs frequency at 20V into  8 4 2 ohmsEven at high levels into low impedances that distortion is the subjectively benign third harmonic  Looking at the spectrum of a highpower lowfrequency tone  the third harmonic lies at –84dB  with the second harmonic next highest in level below –90dB  All other harmonics are below –100dB Keeping the signal level the same but halving the load impedance gives the spectrum shown in fig7 the second harmonic has risen by 6dB the third by 12dB Note also that a 120Hz component just touches the –100dB line I couldnt eliminate this by changing the grounding between my Audio Precision analyzer and the amplifier Nevertheless it is negligibleFig5 Chord SPM 14000 1kHz waveform at 230W into 4 ohms  0035 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 Chord SPM 14000 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 235W into 8 ohms Fig7 Chord SPM 14000 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 450W into 4 ohms With its decreasing linearity at the top of the audioband I wasnt surprised to see the Chord produce a 1kHz difference component at –70dB when driving a mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms close to visible clipping on the oscilloscope  Halving the load impedance  didnt change the level of the 1kHz product but did change the level of the higherorder products at 18kHz and 21kHz to –76dB Even so this is very much a worstcase situation this behavior shouldnt be an issue under normal circumstancesFig8 Chord SPM 14000 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 720W peak into 8 ohms The slight shortfall in its power delivery aside the Chord SPM 14000 delivers excellent measured performance
