0, Jeff Rowland 535 stereo  amplifier I believe it costs US 5900If you are not familiar with Jeff Rowland it is a highend audio company known for their gorgeous machining of their cases that imparts a 3D look You can see that coming through the protective film which I chose to leave onThe unit is incredibly heavy for its small size The back panel shows the most unusual binding posts I have seenThose big knobs rotate to tighten bar on two spade terminals The feel incredibly nice Alas they dont mate with banana leads and I had to screw around to connect mineThe amplifier is said to be balanced throughout including input transformer which is made with wire from Cardas  Company only states that a switching power supply is used but says nothing about the rest of the functionality From my testing it seems to be class D which would explain why the amp stayed completely cool to touch under testing as if it was never on The massive chunk of chassis aluminum is likely responsible for great thermal performanceAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz dashboard at 5 watts into 4 ohmAh this is disappointing Distortion peaks to 80 dB which sets SINAD at an average number of 77This is way below stated of the art in switching amplifier design Company specs are similar by the way so this is representative performance as designedWhere specs dont match is in signal to noise ratioCrosstalk curve usually gets worse with frequency  but here it is rather flatFrequency response is very good with no indication of interaction with the loadAnother shortfall from the spec is in power departmentLetting distortion peak up to 1 still doesnt give us what the spec saysI dont know how they get to 500 watts unless it is at even higher distortion levelsAs a way of comparison lets see how the power curve looks like relative to noise and distortion of Hypex based NC400We have slightly more power although the NC400 I tested had a shared power supply That aside there is no comparison in noise and distortion department The 535 way underperforms the HypexFinally here is an unfiltered output of the amplifier at 5 wattsWe clearly see the switching waveform Attenuation is better than 30 dB which is more than a number of other amps I have tested so that is goodConclusionsThe Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier has beautiful fit and finish And is solidly engineered to run cool and I am sure reliable as a result It produces good bit of power which should be able to drive many speakers to desired loudness Alas it reinvents the wheel and makes it less round Any amplifier based on Hypex modules will have as much or more power with far less noise and distortion and lower costBottom line I cant recommend the Jeff Rowland 535 due to its high cost and average noise and distortion
