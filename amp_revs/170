0, Peachtree iDecco I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before I did any testing of the iDecco I ran it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour which imposes the maximum heat stress on an amplifier with a classAB output stage At the end of that time the iDecco was hot but not botheredLooking first at the iDeccos performance as a digital decoder a fullscale 1kHz tone clipped the amplifiers output stage with the volume control set to 230 The level from the variable preamp outputs with the tube incircuit was 848mV in this condition The maximum level from the linelevel output jacks was 206V sourced from a low impedance of 10 ohms and while both the loudspeaker outputs and the fixedlevel line outs preserved absolute polarity for digital sources the variable preamp outputs inverted polarity with the tube Other than when noted I continued the digital testing from the fixed linelevel outputs with the volume control set to its minimum to avoid stressing the iDeccos amplifier output stageThe iDecco locked to SPDIF datastreams with sample rates ranging from 32 to 96kHz but not to data with sample rates greater than 96kHz The top two pairs of traces in fig1 show the iDeccos DA frequency response with 441kHz data  and 96kHz data  with the rearpanel Filter pushbutton set to Fast The response is flat and extended at both frequency extremes at least until the inevitable steep rolloff just below half the sample rate By contrast the green and gray traces in fig1 show the response with 441kHz taken from the variable preamp outputs with the tube operating the volume control set to 200 and the Filter set to Slow offset by 1dB for clarity There is now a slight  imbalance between the channels and the lowfrequency response is down 3dB at 11Hz At the other end of the spectrum the effect of the Slow filter is to roll off the topoctave output a little early the response being down 3dB at 195kHzFig1 Peachtree iDecco frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms from fixed outputs with data sampled at 441kHz  and 96kHz  and from variable outputs with volume control set to 200  Testing the DACs resolution with a swept bandpass filter while it decoded a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS gave the traces shown in fig2 The top pair of traces were taken at the variable preamp jacks again set to 200 with 16bit data and the bottom pair with 24bit data you can see that the increase in bit depth drops the noise floor by 10dB or so in the treble There is a slight bump at the 60Hz AC line frequency but this is sufficiently far down in level not to be an issue Repeating the analysis this time from the fixedlevel jacks with an FFT technique gave the traces shown in fig3 The increase in bit depth now drops the noise floor by 18dB which implies that the iDeccos ESS 9600 Sabre chip has at least 19bit resolution However some harmonics of the AC frequency can be seen with the 24bit data  and a regular series of distortion harmonics is also unmasked by the lowering of the noise floor DAC linearity error with 16bit data  was vanishingly low to below –100dBFS and the iDeccos noise floor was low enough to allow the three DC voltage levels that describe an undithered 16bit tone at –9031dBFS to be readily resolved  With undithered 24bit data the result was a noisy but otherwise welldefined sinewave Fig2 Peachtree iDecco 13octave

16bit data  24bit data Fig4 Peachtree iDecco waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data Fig5 Peachtree iDecco waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data When it came to distortion the two linelevel outputs varied dramatically The blue and red traces in fig6 show the spectrum of a fullscale 50Hz tone at the fixedoutput jacks The second harmonic lies at –90dB  the third at –80dB  and the fourth at –110dB  By contrast while the third harmonic remains at the same level from the tubed variableoutput jacks the fourth harmonic has risen to –90dB and more significant the second has risen to –50dB  In both cases a picket fence of verylowlevel spuriae is also visible The primary difference between the two outputs is that with the variable jacks the signal passes through a 6922 tube It is the bent transfer function of this tube that generates the evenorder distortionFig6 Peachtree iDecco spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–10kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms from fixed outputs  and from variable outputs with volume control set to 200  As can be seen in fig1 the slow in Slow Filter refers to the rate of the reconstruction filters ultrasonic rolloff It is generally felt that a slower rate of rolloff sounds better but the downside is that there is less rejection of the ultrasonic images that result from the digitizing of the signal This can be seen in fig7 which shows the spectrum of the iDeccos fixed outputs while it decoded 24bit data representing an equal mix of highlevel 19 and 20kHz tones The primary ultrasonic image of the two tones is suppressed by just 12dB and other aliasing spuriae are folded down into the audioband Switching this filter to Fast gives the spectrum shown in fig8 the ultrasonic images have dropped significantly in level as have the audioband aliasing spuriae The primary intermodulation product at 1kHz has risen slightly to –96dB  but this is still negligible in absolute termsFig7 Peachtree iDecco HF intermodulation spectrum Slow Filter DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms Fig8 Peachtree iDecco HF intermodulation spectrum Fast Filter DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms The iDecco offers three choices of digital input SPDIF  USB and from an iPod plugged into the toppanel dock a second rearpanel pushbutton selects between Wide and Narrow receiver PLL bandwidths The Wide setting is to allow the iDecco to successfully lock to digital sources with poortolerance clocks however the downside is that this gives rise to increased levels of jitter Fig9 for example shows the spectrum with the 16bit JTest signal fed to the iDecco via TosLink Though datarelated jitter other than the sidebands at ±229Hz is at the residual level there are strong sidebands at ±18kHz and a significant widening of the central spectral peak due to random lowfrequency clock variations The jitter level was 519 picoseconds peak–peak according to the Miller Analyzer This is still low in absolute terms but switching to the Narrow setting lowered the jitter level to below 200ps narrowed the central peak in the spectrum eliminated the highfrequency sidebands and reduced all datarelated sidebands to the residual level of the test signal  which is superb performanceFig9 Peachtree iDecco Wide receiver highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit data from SYS2722 via 15 TosLink Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHz Fig10 Peachtree iDecco Narrow receiver highresolution jitter spectrum of analog

an iPod in digital format repeating the jitter test with the 16bit JTest signal playing on an iPod Classic 160GB gave a low 310ps of jitter While there were no datarelated sidebands present in the spectrum  there were sidebands of unknown origin present at ±91 and ±816Hz Feeding USB data from my MacBook gave just 260ps of jitter from sidebands at ±1423Hz  The iDecco offers excellent rejection of jitter though with both iPod and USB sources there was significant widening of the central spectral peak again due to the presence of random lowfrequency jitter Examining the iDecco with the Macs USB Prober utility identified the USB receiver as a USB Audio DAC from Burr Brown from TI operating in adaptive isochronous mode and indicated that it accepted 16bit data with sample rates of 32 441 and 48kHz onlyFig11 Peachtree iDecco Narrow receiver highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit data from iPod Classic Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHz Moving on to the iDeccos amplification section the output from the speaker jacks preserved polarity  for digital inputs but inverted absolute polarity for analog signals fed to the Aux input via the tube The maximum gain for analog input signals was fairly low for an integrated amplifier at 287dB into 8 ohms The Aux input impedance was usefully high at 48k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly but inconsequentially to 42k ohms at the top of the audiobandI had to scratch my head a bit when iDeccos output impedance I perform this measurement by comparing the output voltage with the amplifier driving 8 or 4 ohms with how much that voltage rises when I remove the load A simple Ohms Law calculation then gives me the amplifiers output impedance  However when I disconnected the load with the iDecco the output voltage dropped suggesting that the Peachtree actually has a negative output impedance of about –02 ohm This can be seen in the plot of the amplifiers frequency response  where the output with the 2 ohm load  is higher than it is with 4 or 8 ohms This is unusual and suggests that the amplifier circuit uses a degree of positive feedback However the variation in response with our simulated speaker  is very lowFig12 Peachtree iDecco frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Note the lowfrequency rolloff in fig12 which at –3dB at 55Hz is even more extreme than that seen in the response from the preamp outputs  I was puzzled by this but after some thought I repeated the response measurements at various settings of the volume control The traces in fig12 taken with the volume control at its maximum are repeated as the bottom pair of traces in fig13 The other traces in this graph were taken at progressively lower settings of the volume control and you can see that the iDeccos low frequencies are well extended at volumecontrol settings of 1200 and below It looks as if the iDecco reduces its lowfrequency bandwidth as you increase the volume beyond 1200 and that this is performed in the tubed preamp sectionFig13 Peachtree iDecco frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with volume control set to  maximum 300 200 1200 900 Fig12 indicates that the iDeccos ultrasonic response extends well beyond the 200kHz limit of this graph This correlates with very short risetimes on its response to a 10kHz squarewave but there is a small degree of overshoot with veryhighfrequency ringing into lower impedances  Channel separation was good rather than great at 87dB R–L and 59dB L–R at 1kHz as was the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  at 675dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This was primarily due to lowlevel spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics that I couldnt eliminate by experimenting with the grounding between the iDecco and the Audio Precision test system Aweighting the SN ratio which discounts the effects of LF and HF noise thus improved the result to 83dBFig14 Peachtree iDecco smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 4 ohmsPeachtree specifies the iDeccos maximum output power as 40Wpc into 6 ohms  rather than the usual 8 ohms However fig15 shows that the amplifier didnt clip  until 40Wpc into 8 ohms  and 53Wpc into 4 ohms  The lowpower distortion is around 003 but increases in a linear fashion with increasing power this due to the mainly secondharmonic distortion introduced by the preamplifier stage  Intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of highfrequency tones at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen  was primarily the loworder difference product at –50dB  again this stemming from the tubed preamp stage but the powersupply–related spuriae can also be seen in this graph admittedly at a low levelFig15 Peachtree iDecco distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 ohmsFig16 Peachtree iDecco 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  0155 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental

may be budgetpriced but it packs a lot of functionality into a small package Its DA section is particularly impressive technically especially regarding its resolution and rejection of jitter but you need to take the output from the fixed linelevel jacks to get the maximum performance from it As an integrated amplifier the iDeccos performance is dominated by its tubed preamp section which introduces evenorder harmonic distortion much like that of a classic tubed amplifier
