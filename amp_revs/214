0, NAD M28 Multichannel amplifier based on Purifi Eigentakt technology It was kindly purchased by a member from a local dealer  and sent to me for testing The M28 costs US 4999 through its dealersAs with the M27 amplifier I reviewed the M28 comes in the same gorgeous industrial designAt nearly 50 pounds this is a heavy amplifier likely due to the weight of the enclosure as the class D amplifiers and it switching power supply are lightThe one thing I am not a fan of is the touch onoff button on top It is not responsive I wish the NAD logo was a hard switchThe back panel shows how you do a first class job of terminationI have kind permission from the owner for a teardown so look for that soonEDIT Tear down is now here MeasurementsThe Purifi 1ET400A that the NAD is based on scored a SINAD  of 104 dB Lets see we get that from M28Oh no Distortion has risen by 15 dB but thankfully it is below threshold of audibility Noise however has degraded fair bit sinking SINAD by the tune of 6 dB There is also good bit of variability with the SINAD measurement constantly changing 1 dB or more As it is the M28 slips in performance even relative to last years M27For a clue of what may have happened we can look at the amplifier gain which is now at 29 dB versus reference designs 27 dB Given the anemic output of AV products from their preouts I can see why NAD opted to do this but whatever the reason noise performance has suffered We can clearly see this in signal to noise ratioAs noted we have dropped 5 dB in noise performance which more or less explains the similar drop in SINAD This is a shame as noise can be audible unlike low levels of distortion Fortunately we still clear my hurdle of 96 dB for 16 bit content even at 5 watts so practical consequence will be smallBefore someone asks here is the dashboard with RCAThankfully performance is similarFrequency response is good and matches the reference designCrosstalk performance was superbYou buy a power amplifier for wattage so lets see how the M28 performs into 4 ohm loadGosh not only do we have higher noise level but also much higher  distortion as power output increases relative to reference design I did not want to believe this so to confirm my setup I pulled the reference design and measured it again and its performance was unchanged  So this is definitely a degradation in M28 designWe can see similar issue with IMD intermodulation testFortunately as noted we do get more power than the reference design which was likely limited by its power supplyLetting distortion climb up to 1 produces more power naturallyInteresting to see that burst power is actually a bit lower The test attempts to change output power until it achieves 1 THDN and it must have reached that at that lower power I wonder if the sudden burst on the input increases distortion a bit It is an engineering curiosity than anything elseSwitching to 8 ohm load we getWe again have lower performance compared to reference but the gap is lowerWith AVRs we see power reducing as we increase the number of channels Not hereThis is excellent and shows the value of high efficiency amplification and power supplySweeping at different frequencies shows some small oddities but nothing of major concernNote that our normal testing for power per industry standard uses 1 kHz but the most need is at lower frequencies For that reason I have started to annotate power at 20 Hz as seen above All amplifiers I have tested reduce their power at low frequenciesEDIT per request here is multitone testConclusionsWithout context the NAD M28 would get very high praise from me Alas taking a reference design and reducing its performance is not going to put me in that mood This is the cost of manufacturers not providing detailed specificationsmeasurements like I am providing If they had done that their marketing department would immediately see that they have taken a step back and push engineering to do better In absence of that the Eigentakt label is plastered in the marketing material and celebration beginsWhat NAD has done is taken a superior amplifier design and brought its performance below that of older Hypex technology And charge 600 more for the privilege Not rightOn the glass half full side of the argument this is a beautiful amplifier superbly crafted with excellent performance and tons of power I looked and could not find any M27 for sale anyway so M28 it isI am going to of course put the M28 on my recommended list Just no celebration NAD you could have done better
