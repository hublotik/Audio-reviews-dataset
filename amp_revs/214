NAD M28 Multichannel amplifier based Purifi Eigentakt technology It kindly purchased member local dealer sent testing The M28 costs US 4999 dealersAs M27 amplifier I reviewed M28 comes gorgeous industrial designAt nearly 50 pounds heavy amplifier likely due weight enclosure class D amplifiers switching power supply lightThe one thing I fan touch onoff button top It responsive I wish NAD logo hard switchThe back panel shows first class job terminationI kind permission owner teardown look soonEDIT Tear MeasurementsThe Purifi 1ET400A NAD based scored SINAD 104 dB Lets see get M28Oh Distortion risen 15 dB thankfully threshold audibility Noise however degraded fair bit sinking SINAD tune 6 dB There also good bit variability SINAD measurement constantly changing 1 dB As M28 slips performance even relative last years M27For clue may happened look amplifier gain 29 dB versus reference designs 27 dB Given anemic output AV products preouts I see NAD opted whatever reason noise performance suffered We clearly see signal noise ratioAs noted dropped 5 dB noise performance less explains similar drop SINAD This shame noise audible unlike low levels distortion Fortunately still clear hurdle 96 dB 16 bit content even 5 watts practical consequence smallBefore someone asks dashboard RCAThankfully performance similarFrequency response good matches reference designCrosstalk performance superbYou buy power amplifier wattage lets see M28 performs 4 ohm loadGosh higher noise level also much higher distortion power output increases relative reference design I want believe confirm setup I pulled reference design measured performance unchanged So definitely degradation M28 designWe see similar issue IMD intermodulation testFortunately noted get power reference design likely limited power supplyLetting distortion climb 1 produces power naturallyInteresting see burst power actually bit lower The test attempts change output power achieves 1 THDN must reached lower power I wonder sudden burst input increases distortion bit It engineering curiosity anything elseSwitching 8 ohm load getWe lower performance compared reference gap lowerWith AVRs see power reducing increase number channels Not hereThis excellent shows value high efficiency amplification power supplySweeping different frequencies shows small oddities nothing major concernNote normal testing power per industry standard uses 1 kHz need lower frequencies For reason I started annotate power 20 Hz seen All amplifiers I tested reduce power low frequenciesEDIT per request multitone testConclusionsWithout context NAD M28 would get high praise Alas taking reference design reducing performance going put mood This cost manufacturers providing detailed specificationsmeasurements like I providing If done marketing department would immediately see taken step back push engineering better In absence Eigentakt label plastered marketing material celebration beginsWhat NAD done taken superior amplifier design brought performance older Hypex technology And charge 600 privilege Not rightOn glass half full side argument beautiful amplifier superbly crafted excellent performance tons power I looked could find M27 sale anyway M28 isI going course put M28 recommended list Just celebration NAD could done better
