0, of AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier with Bluetooth support  costs US 13999It is so nice to see a VU meter on an amplifier This one actually seems high quality with nice ballistic response  Bass and Treble controls are there but I wish there was a tone defeat as well The position of the indicators is where I had to set them for more or less flat response I do like the very fine detents on it allowing you to more precisely adjust them at leastThe included power supply is one of the largest I have seen but is rather light for its sizeThere are no remotes so the amp is for desktop use Class D implementation means the amp ran with no temperature rise even after all my tests Protection circuit was excellent with automatic restarted after overload The meter is useful in this regard as the amp shuts down when the meter is almost at the end of its rangeAIYIMA A08 Pro MeasurementsI warmed up the unit for about 10 minutes with very stable responseRunning our dashboard we see the usual good performance from AIYIMA amplifier rangePerformance is above average despite the very low costNoise level falls in the same category of very goodAs noted there was a bit of a struggle to get flat responseAnd typical of their designs there is load dependencyCrosstalk was above average for all amplifiers testedMultitone performance was very goodThis little box outputs good bit of power at 4 ohmsEven with 8 ohm load you have good bit of itTransfer function  is pretty good for classConclusionsAIYIMA has a good class D platform which they turn into various configurations with good success The A08 Pro is no exception You get unique looks and to some extent functionality at still a very reasonable price With 100 watts per channel both driven you have very nice capability to drive any desktop speaker to its limit My own wish is the remedy of the load dependency but otherwise this is a job well doneI am going to recommend the AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier As always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
