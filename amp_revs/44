0, Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M amplifiers  for an hour at onethird its specified maximum power of 800W into 8 ohms thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB output stage By the end of the hour the sidemounted heatsinks were way too hot to touch at 1485°F  The chassis was cooler with the top plate measuring 1264°F  though the aluminum vertical corner pieces were 1643°F  Though the distortion with the amplifier completely cold was a low 000825 this was predominantly crossover distortion which will be subjectively disturbing because of its high proportion of highorder harmonics At the end of the preconditioning period the distortion had almost halved to 00045 and the crossover spuriae had disappeared This suggests that potential purchasers of this amplifier should not audition it until it has warmed up amplifier using Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  using the 880Ms balanced input I repeated some of the tests using the unbalanced input with a shorting plug connecting pins 1 and 3 of the 880Ms XLR jackThe voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same for the balanced and unbalanced inputs at 315dB which is about 4dB higher than the norm Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was 23k ohms for both sets of jacks dropping inconsequentially to 18k ohms at 20kHz The output impedance  was slightly higher than usual for a solidstate design at 0125 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 0132 ohm at 20kHz Nevertheless the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms Law interaction between this output impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±01dB Fig1 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  The frequency response was flat in the audioband but with a slight rolloff evident starting just below 20kHz and reaching –3dB at 90kHz A 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with short risetimes  and a 1kHz squarewave had superbly sharp corners Fig2 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted was 818dB due mainly to some lowlevel oddorder harmonics of the AC supply frequency  Switching in an Aweighting filter improved the ratio to a good 914dBFig4 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Moon Evolution 880M comfortably exceeded its specified maximum power of 800W29dBW into 8 ohms clipping  at 1050W  The AC wall voltage had dropped from 123V with the amplifier idling to 120V with it clipping However the 10A fuse on the rear panel blew at the same 1050W into 4 ohms  Clearly the 880M is not comfortable driving sustained high powers into low impedances with sinewaves—with its much higher crest factor music will be less demanding than sinewaves of course—so I didnt test its maximum output into 2 ohmsFig5 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe rising shape of the traces below a few tens of watts in figs 5 and 6 suggests that the measured THDN percentage is dominated by noise at low powers I therefore measured how the THDN varied with frequency at a level 1265V equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms and 40W into 4 ohms that way I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion The result is shown in fig7 The THD rises above 1kHz into both 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  presumably due to the circuits openloop bandwidth being insufficient to apply the same amount of corrective negative feedback at high frequencies as at low frequencies Unusually the midband distortion is actually lower into 4 ohms than into 8 ohms When I tried plotting the THD against frequency into 2 ohms at 1265V the rearpanel fuse again blew As that was the last of my spare 10A fuses I replaced it with an 8A fuse and continued testing Fortunately no more fuses were blownFig7 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Once the 880M is fully warmed up its distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  followed by the second  However some higherorder harmonics are visible in fig9 albeit at or below –110dB  Intermodulation distortion was also low even at high powers Fig8 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M 1kHz waveform at 35W

880M HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 300W peak into 8 ohms Simaudios Moon Evolution 880M is a powerhouse of an amplifier though its ability to drive low impedances does rely on the fact that music has considerably wider dynamic range than do test tones And it should never be listened to cold
