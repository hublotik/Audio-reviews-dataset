0, Dayton Audio APA1200DSP DSP analog and digital input stereo class D amplifier   drop shipped to me Parts Express is selling it for US 650 right nowThe APA1200DSP has nicer look than typical pro amplifiersThe back is especially nice with the type of connectivity you need in a home systemBoth analog and digital inputs are provided Ethernet input allows a nicely done web interface to be used from anywhereThere is a microphone I believe and ability to automatically calibrate the room response I did not use or dive into this functionalityThere is a fan that came on when powered on but nicely powered down gradually and I did not hear it during operation When it runs it has a lower frequency and a bit less annoying than on pro amplifiersThere is a strange setting for 2 vs 4 ohm speaker load I set it to 4 since I tested it at 4 and 8 ohms Manual doesnt say exactly what this doesAPA1200DSP Amplifier MeasurementsI set the gain to 10 dB which gave me the nominal 29 dB I look for and measured using XLR inputSwitching to digital input showed essentially the same performanceThis level of noisedistortion  puts this amp way down in our rankingsNoise level was not very good either using analog or digital inputUnit was stable on power up which is goodCrosstalk was decentMultitone suffered from high noise floor and sporadic distortion spikesSadly frequency response is highly load dependent due to class D amps output filter interactingWe also see sharp cut off due to internal processing being at low sampling rate Switching to digital input at 96 kHz sampling made no differenceThe name indicates it produces 1200 watts Lets see what it can do into 4 om with both channels drivenThe curve wiggles as protection circuit kicks in Prior to that it produced 370 watts Letting distortion rise to 1 didnt do much betterSwitching to 8 ohm naturally cut the power substantiallyStepping through the test frequency shows a number of odd behaviorsConclusionsTypical of this class of amplifier power specs are mostly imaginary Objective measurement of noise and distortion are also typical with little attention paid to minimize them So you are left with buying this for functionality not because it has any great implementation of class D amplificationI cant recommend the Dayton Audio APA1200DSP DSP based on its pure measured performance Edit teardown posted always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
