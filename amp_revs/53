0,The ASR Emitter II Exclusives battery power supply was fully charged when I began my testing After Id preconditioned the amplifier with both channels running for an hour at onethird maximum power into 8 ohms the heatsinks were only just too hot to touch  and the THDnoise percentage was 00164—not significantly different from the figure of 00137 with the amplifier cold The voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to 61 the normal highest level in Energy Saving Mode was 272dB Setting the volume control to its maximum of 76 in fullpower mode resulted in a voltage gain of 419dB This was for singledended drive For balanced drive the maximum gain was 6dB lower due to the use of the balancedunbalanced conversion circuitry The ASR was noninverting through all of its inputs and its unbalanced input impedance was 10k ohms at all frequencies including via the Direkt jackThe ASRs output impedance was very low 008 ohm across the audioband  As a result the modification of the Emitter IIs frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between this impedance and that of the speaker was also very low  Fig1 also reveals that the ASR has a very wide smallsignal bandwidth—the –3dB point lies at almost 200kHz—though this decreases into lower impedances Also shown is a residual peak at around 130kHz perhaps an indication of a parasitic resonance somewhere in the circuit which adds a very small overshoot to the shape of a 10kHz squarewave  Channel separation  was good rather than great at 70dB at 1kHzFig1 ASR Emitter II Exclusive frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 4 2 ohms Fig2 ASR Emitter II Exclusive smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Emitter IIs unweighted wideband SN Ratio taken with the volume control at 76 but with the input shorted was 782dB ref 1W into 8 ohms Reducing the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz improved the figure to 899dB while Aweighting improved it further to 924dBTesting the Emitter II Exclusives powerdelivery at clipping was an exercise in frustration as the amplifiers protection circuitry would turn the amplifier off before it actually clipped and flash a red warning light on the front panel The protection circuitry had to be reset by turning the amplifier fully off There also appeared to be some kind of history effect in that once the amplifier had shut itself off it would not allow as much power to be delivered to the test load the next time I tried to clip it So bear all of that in mind when you look at the traces in fig3 which plots the ASRs THDN percentage against output power into loads ranging from 8 ohms down to 2 ohms The bottom trace was taken with both channels driven into 8 ohms it stops at 285W  which is where the amplifier shut down not where it clipped Subsequently tested with both channels driven into 4 ohms  the ASR shut off at 128W But with one channel driven into 2 ohms  the Emitter II didnt shut itself off until it was putting out 830W Fig3 ASR Emitter II Exclusive distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsThe shape of the traces in fig3 suggests that the Emitter IIs distortion lies under the noise below output powers of 10W or so I therefore examined how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 115V output equivalent to 165W into 8 ohms The results are shown in fig4 which shows that while the THD is very low at low and midrange frequencies it does rise with both increasing frequency and decreasing load impedance though not to any level that might be thought to be subjectively significantFig4 ASR Emitter II Exclusive THDN  vs frequency at 115V into  8 4 2 ohms Fig5 suggests that the distortions harmonic content is predominantly loworder although a peculiar discontinuity in the distortion waveform at the start of each sinewave cycle is more pronounced into low than into high impedances This is examined somewhat differently in figs6 and 7 which show the spectra of the ASRs output while it drives a 50Hz tone at high levels into 8 and 4 ohms respectively The difference made by doubling the output current at low frequencies appears mainly to be the introduction of thirdharmonic distortion to accompany the second harmonic though the levels of both harmonics are still very low at –86dB  But at higher frequencies at high powers the fifth seventh and ninth harmonics all make more of an appearance Fig5 ASR Emitter II Exclusive 1kHz waveform at 325W into 4 ohms  00078 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 ASR Emitter II Exclusive spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 112W into 8 ohms Fig7 ASR Emitter II Exclusive spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 225W into 4 ohms Fig8 ASR Emitter II Exclusive spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 225W into 4 ohms Intermodulation distortion was very low even at very high powers into 4 ohms  This graph incidentally was taken with one channel driven about an hour after the THDvspower curves were taken You can see that the Emitter IIs protection circuitry had now allowed me to drive the amplifier at a higher level into 4 ohms than it had before Fig9 ASR Emitter II Exclusive HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 555W peak into 4 ohms With its three separate power supplies and its tethered power cables the ASR Emitter II Exclusive was awkward to set up in my test lab But its measured performance is overall beyond reproach and when I auditioned it in Michael Fremers system prior to taking it home with me the sound of his big Wilson speakers had an ease and a dynamic sweep that I had not experienced before from his system This unusual amplifier is definitely a highend contender
