0,The D 3020 was voted Stereophiles Budget Component of 2014 Getting the review sample onto my test bench had been on my todo list for way too long but I was reminded of the unfinished task when I picked up the PS Audio Sprout for measurement from Herb Reichert whose review of the latter appears elsewhere in this issue I first checked the performance of the D 3020s digital inputs looking at the signal from the headphone output jack  The headphone output preserved absolute polarity for both analog and digital input signals and the output impedance was on the high side at 200 ohms at all audio frequencies For analog input signals the D 3020s headphone output offers a maximum gain of 286dB but a digital signal with a level of –12dBFS clipped the headphone output with the volume control set to its maximum At –14dBFS the unclipped output level was 681V so except as noted for the digitalinput measurements I reduced the volumecontrol setting to avoid clipping The D 3020 locked to an SPDIF datastream with sample rates up to 192kHz even via TosLink though the USB input was restricted to 96kHz and below Apples USB Prober utility identified the D 3020 as NAD USB Audio with the serialnumber string  2011 Wavelength Audio ltd This implies that the D 3020 uses Gordon Rankins Streamlength asynchronous USB protocol and USB Prober did indeed confirm that the USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous modeThe reconstruction filters impulse response  was a conventional FIR type with timesymmetrical ringing while wideband spectral analysis of the analog output as the NAD decoded 441Hz data representing white noise at –4dBS  indicated that the response rolled off quickly above half the sample rate  The sampling image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  was suppressed by more than 90dB Note the rise in the ultrasonic noise floor in fig2 suggesting that the D 3020s DAC stage uses some kind of sigmadelta upsampling Fig3 is a more conventional response measurement taken with 441 96 and 192kHz data The overall shape of the response at ultrasonic frequencies is the same—a small 04dB rise above the audioband—broken by a sharp rolloff just below 22 and 47kHz with the two lower ratesFig1 NAD D 3020 headphone output impulse response at 441kHz Fig2 NAD D 3020 headphone output wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with USB data sampled at 441kHz Fig3 NAD D 3020 headphone output frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  To assess the D 3020s digital resolution I set the volume control to its maximum an unrealistic situation that did allow me to examine by how many dB the noise floor dropped when I changed from 16bit data representing a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS to 24bit data Fig4 shows that the noise floor dropped by almost 20dB indicating ultimate resolution of better than 19 bits—superb performance even without taking into account the D 3020s very affordable price The NADs reproduction of an undithered 16bit 1kHz sinewave at exactly –9031dBFS  was essentially perfect with the three DC voltage levels described by the data easily visible With undithered 24bit data the result was a superbly welldefined sinewave Fig4 NAD D 3020 headphone output spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Fig5

to jitter did I encounter some anomalous behavior via the D 3020s digital inputs Fig7 shows the spectrum of the headphone output with 24bit JTest data fed to the D 3020s USB input No sidebands are visible around the 11025kHz tone and the noise floor is superbly clean By contrast fig8 shows the spectrum of the analog output with the same data fed to the optical SPDIF input Some sidebands of unknown origin are visible and the noise floor now has a peculiar sculpted appearance This modulation of the noise floor was not apparent with the 191kHz tone in fig2 which was taken with USB data Repeating that test with SPDIF data I got a similar noisefloor modulation to that seen in fig8Fig7 NAD D 3020 headphone output highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS

±35kHzWhereas the original 3020 used a conventional output stage based on a complementary pair of 2N2055MJ2955 bipolar transistors the D 3020 as its name implies is a classD design and so produces ultrasonic noise that would overload the Audio Precisions input circuitry I therefore performed most of the tests of the D 3020 as a power amplifier using ahead of the analyzer an Audio Precision AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz Assessed at the speaker outputs the D 3020 offered a modest maximum gain for linelevel sources of 338dNB and was noninverting The input impedance ranged from 143k ohms at 20Hz to 11k ohms at 20kHz the output impedance was around 015 ohm at all audio frequencies resulting in a modulation of the amplifiers frequency response of less than ±015dB with our standard simulated loudspeaker  The response was –05dB at 20kHz above which it rolled off sharply  Commendably the response didnt change at different volumecontrol settings and switching the Bass equalization into circuit gave a boost of just over 6dB centered between 70 and 80Hz with a sharp rolloff below that region  The D 3020s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave with the Audio Precision lowpass filter in circuit was well defined with just the slightest hint of overshoot on the leading edges Fig9 NAD D 3020 volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V

set to its maximum but the input shorted and with the AP filter incircuit was an excellent 802dB this improved to 913dB when Aweighted Fig12 shows a spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloorFig12 NAD D 3020 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Figs 13 and 14 show how the percentage of THDnoise in the NADs output changed with output power into 8 and 4 ohms respectively The minimum distortion level was low and the D 3020 clipped  at 58Wpc into 8 ohms  and 68Wpc into 4 ohms  These two graphs reveal that the actual distortion is buried beneath the noise floor at levels below a few watts I therefore examined how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 9V equivalent to 10Wpc into 8 ohms or 20Wpc into 4 ohms The result  revealed no change in the distortion at different frequencies a commendable resultFig13 NAD D 3020 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig14 NAD D 3020 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig15 NAD D 3020 THDN  vs frequency at 9V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion at lower powers was primarily the third harmonic  with the second harmonic becoming predominant at higher powers  though lowerlevel higherorder harmonics are also present Intermodulation distortion was also low even at a level a few dB below visible waveform clipping Fig16 NAD D 3020 1kHz waveform at 10W into 4

1920kHz at 23W peak into 8 ohms I was impressed by the NAD D 3020s technical performance It packs a usefully powerful amplifier into a tiny package and offers digital performance that is close to the state of the art though its USB input is to be preferred In fact the only problems I had with this little gem was that the touch switch on its top panel for bringing the amplifier out of and into standby didnt always respond And the first time I tried disabling the Bass boost with the tiny rearpanel pushbutton the D 3020 locked up and wouldnt respond to any commands necessitating a hard rebootStephen Mejias concluded his original review of the D 3020 by asking Will  be the component that introduces a new generation of music lovers to true highfidelity sound Id like to think that the answer to that question is Yes
