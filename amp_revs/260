0, AIYIMA A200 stereo amplifier with USB DAC and Bluetooth  costs about US 160The compact size should fit on desks well Controls are simplicity in themselves push in the volume control to select input  Rotate for volumeNice to see builtin power supply unlike other AIYIMA offerings that required large external ones Design is based on TI TPA3255 ICAIYIMA A200 MeasurementsLets start with RCA inputSINAD which represents a measure of noise and distortion is above averageUnfortunately digital input degrades that someSo the rest of the tests are with RCA input SNR is good for classAs is distortion as represented by multitoneFrequency response is flat enough but is load  dependentCrosstalk is goodLets see how much clean power it can produce with 4 and 8 ohm loadsAllowing for 1 THD we dont get more power but burst delivery is higherFor a desktop amp this is pretty good amount of juiceSweeping at different frequencies shows very predictable responseOf note power doesnt drop much at 20 Hz which is very good Finally the amp is good more or less when you power it upConclusionsAIYIMA once again shows that it has as solid hold in the midpower amplifier market with above average performance at bargain prices Integrated power supply solves one of the hassles of their separates and provides nice turnkey solution Interface and build is good for the class So really if you want a competent amplifier with good power and little money you have itI am going to recommend the AIYIMA A200 amplifier
