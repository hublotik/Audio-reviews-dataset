0,I dont have the necessary equipment to test the Krell components in their currentmode  operation Therefore I performed all the technical tests using conventional voltagemode drive in both balanced and unbalanced operationWith its volume control set to 151 the Evolution 202 preamplifier offered maximum voltage gains of 118dB in full balanced mode 575dB in unbalanced mode Both modes preserved absolute polarity ie were noninverting The volume controls unitygain setting was 101 for balanced operation 124 for unbalanced The unbalanced input impedance was a usefully high 38k ohms in the bass and midrange dropping slightly but inconsequentially to 33k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was exactly twice the unbalanced as expected The output impedance was low at 45 ohms balanced 225 ohms unbalancedThe Evolution 202 offered a very wide bandwidth its response down by just a quarter of a dB at 200kHz  This didnt vary with volumecontrol setting or load impedance and was identical in the balanced and unbalanced modes There is a small rise in output at infrasonic frequencies presumably a function of the DC servo DC offset was negligible Channel separation  was superb at better than 110dB below 5kHz  and 198kHz  with the volume control set to its maximum Note however the slight peaks at 180Hz and 300Hz in this graph possibly due to magnetic coupling from the power supply which had to be placed directly under the preamp chassis for the testing due to the short umbilical cable Even so the levels of these spuriae are way too low to be audible though they did reduce the worstcase unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio to a still good 822dB  Aweighting increased this figure to a superb 957dBFig1 Krell Evolution 202 balanced frequency response at 1V into  100k 600 ohms Fig2 Krell Evolution 202 channel separation in balanced  and unbalanced  modes The Krell preamp could swing very high output voltages even into low impedances Fig3 reveals that the balanced output didnt clip  into 100k ohms until 16V RMS with the unbalanced output clipping at 8V These figures are significantly higher than that required to drive the Evolution 600 power amplifier into clipping More important you can see in this graph how the actual distortion remains below the noise floor until 4V  and 2V  which suggests that the preamps gain architecture has been sensibly optimized I plotted the balanced THD percentage against frequency at 4V the level suggested by fig3 but there was no difference in the preamps behavior across the audioband and the THD remained very low even into the punishing 600 ohm load Fig3 Krell Evolution 202 THDN vs 1kHz output voltage  balanced into 100k ohms 600 ohms unbalanced into 100k 10k 1k 600 ohmsFig4 Krell Evolution 202 balanced THDN  vs frequency at 4V into  100k 600 ohms And even with its very low level of distortion the spectral content of that distortion was benign with only the second and third harmonics rising above the residual level of my signal generator  Intermodulation distortion was also low Fig5 Krell Evolution 202 unbalanced spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 1V into 8k ohms Fig6 Krell Evolution 202 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 1V peak into 8k ohms  Evolution 600 power amplifier by running it at 200W into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that period the THDnoise percentage had dropped from 00159 to 00064 but the internally housed heatsinks were too hot to touch The chassis itself was around 55°C at the rear but cooler than that toward the front Like the Evolution 202 the Evolution 600 monoblock was measured only in voltage mode Its voltage gain  was a little lower than average at 2525dB meaning that it needs almost 4V RMS from both its balanced and unbalanced inputs to be driven to its maximum output power It preserved absolute polarity and the input impedance was a high 90k ohms unbalanced 200k ohms balancedMy measurement of the 600s output impedance was 0124 ohm which is higher than the specified figure My measurement does include 6 of cable though this should account for no more than a small fraction of the difference But this is still low enough that the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction between this impedance and that of the loudspeaker is negligible at ±01dB  This graph also reveals that the power amplifier has a wide smallsignal bandwidth though not as wide as the Evolution 202 preamplifier The –3dB point lay at 116kHz with a verywelldefined 10kHz squarewave the result  The bandwidth did decrease slightly into 2 ohms but was the same for balanced and unbalanced driveFig7 Krell Evolution 600 frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 4 2 ohms Fig8 Krell Evolution 600 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig9 reveals that the Evolution 600 was a powerhouse clipping with continuous drive at 610W into 8 ohms  1190W into 4 ohms  and 22kW into 2 ohms  I dont hold my AC wall voltage constant for these tests at 1258V with the amplifier quiescent it had dropped to 1218V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms 119V with it clipping into 2 ohms With its SN ratio  of 817dB  improving to 923dB when Aweighted the Evolution 600 offers a superbly wide dynamic range that well exceeds that of the 16bit CD mediumFig9 Krell Evolution 600 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsI plotted the 600s THDN percentage against frequency at 11V output the level at which as indicated in fig9 the distortion harmonics begin to rise out of the  noise floor Even so as fig10 reveals though the percentage does rise with decreasing load impedance it remains very low and constant with frequency at audio frequencies And as with the 202 preamplifier the harmonic content of the 600s distortion remains low in order almost entirely second and thirdharmonic in nature  with no ACsupply spuriae visible even at high powers  Intermodulation distortion was also very low even at almost 800W into 4 ohms Fig10 Krell Evolution 600 THDN vs frequency at 11V into  8 4 2 ohmsFig11 Krell Evolution 600 1kHz waveform at 200W into 8 ohms  00065 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig12 Krell Evolution 600 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 213W into 8 ohms Fig13 Krell Evolution 600 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 790W peak into 4 ohms Having had on my test bench in recent months a number of shall I say idiosyncratically engineered products it was a pleasure to measure such a wellengineered pair of components as the Krell Evolution 202 and 600
