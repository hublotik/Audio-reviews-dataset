0, Bricasti Design M15    I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time the Bricastis top panel was warm at 101°F  and its heatsinks were hotter at 1031°F  The M15 has sufficient heatsinking for its power ratingThe voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 269dB for both balanced and unbalanced signals and both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  The unbalanced input impedance was 88k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz decreasing at 20kHz to 34k ohms The balanced input impedance was 170k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz decreasing to 99k ohms at 20kHz Though these impedances are somewhat lower than the specified 100k ohms unbalanced and 200k ohms balanced they are still usefully highThe output impedance including a 6 spacedpair speaker cable was a very low 008 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 01 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the modulation of the M15s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was less than ±01dB  The Bricastis frequency response is down by 3dB at 180kHz as a result a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with very short risetimes  and there was no overshoot or ringing with a resistive loadFig1 Bricasti M15 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Bricasti M15 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the inputs shorted to ground was a very high 812dB in the left channel but slightly lower in the right at 77dB  These ratios improved to a respective 84 and 78dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 86 and 834dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor  indicated that the AC supply–related harmonics were at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics suggesting that these are due to magnetic interference from the massive power transformer They lay at or below –98dB  howeverFig3 Bricasti M15 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Bricasti specifies the M15 as outputting 125Wpc into 8 ohms  250Wpc into 4 ohms  and 500Wpc into 2 ohms  The amplifier comfortably exceeded its specified power even with both channels driven With clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1 I measured clipping powers of 290Wpc into 8 ohms  and 550Wpc into 4 ohms  However I had some difficulty measuring the maximum output power as the M15 went into protection several times the red LED on its front panel flashing And when I tried to measure the clipping power into 2 ohms the amplifier turned off at 362W  I doubt that this sensitivity will be a problem in realworld systems but I was surprised by this behaviorFig4 Bricasti M15 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Bricasti M15 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsTo be certain that I was measuring actual distortion I examined how the M15s percentage of THDN varied with frequency at a fairly high level 20V  Even so the THDN was extremely low in the bass and midrange and while there was the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in openloop voltage gain as the frequency increases this was still not to a significant amount Fig6 Bricasti M15 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The THDN waveform at this level  indicates that the distortion is predominantly thirdharmonic in nature though at high powers into 4 ohms the second harmonic became the highest in level in both channels  Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones the Bricasti produced relatively low levels of intermodulation distortion even at high powers into low impedances  with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –100dB  and the higherorder products at or below –84dB Fig7 Bricasti M15 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00012 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Bricasti M15 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig9 Bricasti M15 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Fig10 Bricasti M15 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms Its measured performance indicates that Bricasti Designs M15 amplifier is conservatively engineered with low noise and distortion though it is clearly less happy driving 2 ohms than it is higher impedances
