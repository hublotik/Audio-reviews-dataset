0,To precondition an amplifier before testing I run it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour For an amplifier with a classB output stage this thermally stresses the amplifier to the maximum extent To my alarm after 15 minutes of driving 67Wpc into 8 ohms the top panel of the KAV400xi above the internal heatsinks was way too hot to touch implying a temperature well above 60ºC the chassis was also too hot to touch and smelled of hot insulation More alarming the distortion level a good 005 when the amplifier was cold had risen to 015 and was continuing to rise Worried about the amplifier being damaged by thermal runaway I concluded the preconditioning at that pointThe Krell is one of an increasing number of widedynamicrange amplifiers that do not have sufficient heatsink area to allow continuous highpower operation This tradeoff may permit a product to be competitively priced—using appropriately sized heatsinks for a 200Wpc amplifier would significantly increase its cost—but it needs to be pointed out While it is unlikely the Krell will overheat in normal use it may well do so when used for a partyThe KAV400xis input impedance at 1kHz was a usefully high 47k ohms double that for the balanced input The amplifier was noninverting through both balanced and unbalanced inputs and the maximum voltage gain was 357dB  The 152position volume control operated in approximately 02dB steps at the extremes of its range these increasing to 04dB steps in the middle of the range and 07dB steps around the unitygain setting of 39 The 0 position mutes the outputThe output impedance was a little higher than usual for a solidstate design at 035 ohm across most of the audioband this rising slightly at 20kHz As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response reached ±025dB when it drove Stereophiles simulated speaker load  Into resistive loads the response was flat in the audioband with a very slight rise below 20Hz and a highfrequency 3dB point of 134kHz which correlates with excellent 1kHz and 10kHz squarewave shapes  there not being any hint of overshoot or ringing The response was the same through both balanced and unbalanced inputs and was not affected by the setting of the volume controlFig1 Krell KAV400xi balanced frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig2 Krell KAV400xi smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Krell KAV400xi smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was excellent in the audioband at better than 85dB LR and 80dB RL in the treble beneath 1kHz the crosstalk was buried in the noise floor With the high gain however the amplifiers signalnoise ratio  with the input shorted and the volume control set to 151 was good rather than great at 622dB wideband This increased to 71dB when AweightedThe noise presumably contributes to the shape of the THDnoise curves plotted against output power  where the downward slope with increasing power is due to the reducing proportion of a constant noise level However looking at the distortion spuriae on an oscilloscope revealed there to be distortion harmonics in the noise and as I found with the preconditioning this level increased as the amplifier got hotter The important point to note from fig4 is that the Krell comfortably exceeds its specified output power No fewer than 290W were available with both channels driven into 8 ohms  at our normal 1 THD definition of clipping with 350W available into 4 ohms  However with one channel driven into 2 ohms that channels rearpanel 3A fuse blew at 500W output  which is why the trace in fig4 ends at that point Replacing the fuse restored the amplifier to normal operationFig4 Krell KAV400xi distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohmsConcerned about the temperaturedependent nature of the amplifiers linearity  manner in which the KAV400xis THDnoise percentage varied with frequency at a moderately high level  into 2 4 and 8 ohms The results are shown in fig5 the audioband distortion is nicely below 01 into 8 ohms with the right channel a little more linear than the left A rise in THD above the audioband gets more severe into the lower impedances but this is nothing to be concerned about I then repeated the measurement after running the amplifier at 67Wpc into 8 ohms for 15 minutes The results are shown in fig6 Again the rise in distortion above 20kHz can be seen but now the audioband distortion has tripledFig5 Krell KAV400xi when cold THDN  vs frequency at 16V into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig6 Krell KAV400xi when hot THDN  vs frequency at 16V into  8 ohms 4 ohms Of more subjective importance than the absolute level of an amplifiers distortion is its spectrum with loworder harmonics being more benign than highorder Unfortunately the Krells distortion waveform  suggests the presence of both the spikes in the waveform coinciding with the zerocrossing points This measurement was taken with the amplifier very hot hence the highish distortion level of 047 The level was lower with the amplifier cold but the spikes increased in amplitude as it warmed upFig7 Krell KAV400xi when hot 1kHz waveform at 23W into 4 ohms  047 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out This is shown in a different manner in fig8 the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove a 50Hz tone at half power into 4 ohms A regularly decreasing series of odd harmonics can be seen interspersed with a lowerlevel series of even harmonics The fact that the harmonics decrease in level with increasing order might mitigate their audibility but I must admit to some alarm at seeing this behavior Finally the decrease in the circuits linearity at high frequencies referred to earlier results in rather more intermodulation products than I like to see in the highpower highfrequency intermodulation test  taken just below the level that caused visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope screen However this is at a very high output power the spuriae fell rapidly with decreasing powerFig8 Krell KAV400xi spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Fig9 Krell KAV400xi HF intermodulation spectrum DC24kHz 1920kHz at 350W peak into 4 ohms Summing up the Krell KAV400xis measured performance is difficult as some of its odd behavior will not be an issue when it comes to playing back music at normal listening levels It is also possible that our sample was defective though the fact that both channels behaved similarly is evidence for that not being the case But I would avoid pairing the amplifier with loudspeakers that drop below 4 ohms—such as Krells own Resolution 1—and would make sure it had adequate ventilation
