0, Neurochrome Modulus286 Power  amplifier Kit  company designer and member tomchr It is to ship by end of this month and costs 1299 See you may recall from my review of Toms headphone amplifier Neurochrome designs strive for very low distortion and good objective performance So I have been quite excited and anxious to measure one of Toms power amplifiersFrom the outside the Modulus286 is rather small but very chunky look with massive heatsinks  on each side of the unitThe heart of Modulus286 and other solid state amplifiers Tom designs are the integrated LM3886 IC from Texas Instruments I suspect this is from the National Semiconductor team though which was acquired by TIThe LM3886 is a pretty powerful little IC capable of producing about 70 watts at 4 ohm The Modulus286 uses a pair of them to get over 100 watts of power at the same rating for each channel Typical of mass market amplifier ICs though the distortion rating is nothing to write home about at 002  In Toms design an active feedback loop  brings this distortion way down as you will see in the measurementsThe LM3886 is a class AB amplifier unlike other products we have tested that use much more efficient class D So while the LM3886 by itself is small it requires pretty large heatsinks to cool it which is the reason for them being included in Modulus286 But in addition to the amplifier circuit another source of size weight and some heat is the power supply Here Modulus286 deviates from classic class AB designs by using a switching power supply to gain its size and weight advantage You can see it in the center of the Modulus286It is a commercial switching supply which Tom says has been customized for his useThe amplifier modules are actually hard to see on each side of the central power supply I tried to take a picture of them but it was hardYou can see the two LM3886 ICs mounted to the heatsink at the bottom I am sure there are better pictures at Toms websiteSo lets get into the measurements and see how she doesMeasurementsAs usual I start with my dashboard view with 5 watts of output and in this case XLR balanced inputsSINAD  breaks the 100 dB barrier which is nice You can see that the distortion of 00009 is orders of magnitude better than the specified level by TI I noticed a lot more mainspower supply noise in one channel than the other Nothing I did would impact its level I could also feel the tingling sensation from the case which indicates mains leakage This is legal and safe  but does explain the elevated levels there Of course at 110 dB is not audible since our hearing is so poor in low frequenciesNext  all important power versus distortionnoiseCompared to our best measured so far Hypex NC400 the Modulus286 nearly matches it in noise level On distortion one channel also tracks the NC400 until its max power of 95 watts This was with 0975 millivolts of input Attempting to feed it strong signal would cause it to go into protection so I could not quite get to the specified power ratingOne channel deviates some though as you see in light red the better channel goes as low at 00007 of THDN or SINAD of 103 Seeing how this is at max power it is very nice figure to arrive at Performance is basically noise dominated with no distortion until the shut downThe Hypex DIY NC400 has more power but its distortion starts to rise from where Modulus286 stops It produces 226 watts at the point I have marked in blue So it has more headroomFrequency response shows somewhat early roll offWe are down 04 dB at 20 kHz Would have been nice to see this flatter seeing how this is a traditional class AB design Likely it is part of the computation to keep the amplifier stable with different loads Of course not an audible concern for most of us who cant even hear 20 kHz let alone 04 dB of drop in there Signal to noise ratio is quite goodBroadband spectrum analysis to 1 MHz shows very little of concernWe see some indication of the switching frequency of the power supply around 160 kHz but its level is quite low at nearly 100 dB With class D amplifiers we see levels as high as 30 dB Note that since this is a class AB amplifier I did NOT use my AES17 filter with any of the testsI tested THDN versus frequency at 6 different power levels as you see on the graphAs expected distortion rises at higher frequencies  At 97 watts the Modulus286 could produce frequencies above 1 kHz but below that it would enter into protection mode as indicated by vertical lines in orangeAt the lowest power level  we are dominated by noise and hence the elevated line in red for that That is true of any power amplifierFinally here is the crosstalk for one channel Please take this as worst case response I am testing the amp using a bunch of wires everywhere which can impact crosstalk  I need to build a dedicated module with tight wiring for tests like this Regardless numbers like this are amply good enough as far as audibility is concernedConclusionsThe Neurochrome delivers good power with very low distortion using a combination of active feedback and offtheshelf amplifier IC Use of a switching power supply keeps costs size and weight down It produces nearly 100 watts of very clean power into 4 ohm load Personally I like to have much more power than that  But if you have subwoofers or dont listen as loud andor have more efficient loudspeakers you should be fineI am not sure what value judgement to put on the amplifier Certainly at 1300 the Modulus286 amplifier is cheap compared to any highend amplification At the other externe the DIY Hypex NC400 I tested produced more power at I think 1500 Purchasing the Neurochrome Modulus286 would let you support a smart Canadian designer and entrepreneur I let you decide how valuable that isOverall I can recommend the Neurochrome Modulus286 as a wellengineered product with no design faults
