0,   Classé CA3200 by running it for 60 minutes at onethird power with all three channels driven into 8 ohms At the end of that time the THDnoise had dropped from 00024 to 000195 but the top panel and the heatsinks were way too hot to touch the curved front panel was around 50°C and a noticeable draft of hot air rose from the toppanel vents over the center channels internal heatsink If this amplifier is to be used in a custom installation it should be well ventilatedThe voltage gain into 8 ohms was to specification at 29dB and well matched across the three channels The amplifier was noninverting  for both unbalanced and balanced input signals the XLRs for the latter are wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance for the unbalanced jacks was 70–75k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz and exactly double that for the balanced inputsThe output impedance was a very low 0047 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising slightly but inconsequentially to 0075 ohm at 20kHz As a result any modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the way in which the partnering loudspeakers impedance changes with frequency will be minimal For example with our standard simulated speaker the response changed by just ±005dB  The amplifiers response was flat to 20kHz into 8 and 4 ohms but dropped by 02dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms The smallsignal bandwidth was wide the –3dB point into 8 ohms lying at 150kHz for both balanced and unbalanced drive Correlating with that the waveform of a 10kHz squarewave showed very small risetimes with only the faintest hint of overshoot Fig1 Classé CA3200 frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 4 2 ohms Fig2 Classé CA3200 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe CA3200s channel separation  was better than 95dB between all possible pairs of channels at 1kHz It did decrease at the frequency extremes however The amplifiers wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  was good rather than great at 739dB balanced and 712dB unbalanced Reducing the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz improved both ratios to 914dB while switching in an Aweighting filter gave further improvement to 939dBFig3 Classé CA3200 channel separation  L–C  C–L  L–R  R–L  C–R  R–C  With one channel driven the CA3200 easily exceeded its specified output power  With clipping defined as 1 THDN the Classé clipped at 250W into 8 ohms  and 450W into 4 ohms  The 2 ohm trace in this graph cuts off at 661W  which is when the CA3200 went into protection and the active channels frontpanel blue LED blinked red After resetting the amplifier I determined that the overload had done no damageFig4 Classé CA3200 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohms one channel drivenThe shapes of the traces in fig4 indicates that the distortion remains under the noise floor below a few tens of watts so I plotted how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 17V RMS The results are shown in fig5 while the THD remains very low below 1kHz even into 2 ohms it does rise at higher frequencies presumably due to the decrease in the circuits openloop gain at high frequencies However the THD level is still low in absolute termsFig5 Classé CA3200 THDN vs frequency at 17V into  8 4 2 ohms At low frequencies the CA3200s distortion content was predominantly second and third harmonic  But at higher currents and frequencies not only did the third harmonic increase in level  but some higherorder harmonics appeared  Even so intermodulation distortion was very low even at an output level just below visual clipping on the oscilloscope screen Fig6 Classé CA3200 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Fig7 Classé CA3200 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 200W into 4 ohms Fig8 Classé CA3200 1kHz waveform at 140W into 2 ohms  00058 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Classé CA3200 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 255W peak into 4 ohms Overall this is excellent measured performance though the increase in highorder THD at high current levels did raise my eyebrows
