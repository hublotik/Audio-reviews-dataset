0, Marantz PMKIPearl with Stereophiles loan sample of the  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain  I run it for 60 minutes at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms Thermally this is the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage At the end of this period the Marantzs case was warm to the touch but the grilles above its internal heatsink werent so hot that I couldnt keep my hands on them implying a temperature around 130°F  The amplifiers heatsinking is clearly adequate for its output powerAssessed at the Pearls Tape Out jacks its phono input offered 383dB of gain set to MM  and 5675dB set to MC  though the latter figure will have been decreased a little by the Ohms Law interaction between the generators 20 ohm source impedance and the 101 ohm measured input impedance of the MC input Set to MM the input impedance was 48k ohms at all frequencies The phono input preserved absolute polarity  in both MM and MC modes The unweighted audioband signalnoise ratio was excellent in both modes at 704dB  and 539dB  these figures improving when Aweighted to 811dB and 637dB respectively Channel separation  was superb at almost 90dB over most of the audiobandThe KIPearls RIAA error is shown in fig1 the departure from perfect equalization is vanishingly low in the left channel  but reaches a maximum of 04dB in the midbass in the right channel  Both channels start to roll out below 30Hz reaching –2dB just below 10Hz at the other end of the spectrum the response above 16kHz appears to follow the socalled Neumann fourth pole modification Fig1 Marantz PMKIPearl RIAA error of phono input The Pearls phono input offered very low distortion at normal signal levels around 003 THDnoise but also featured superb overload margins The MM mode didnt reach 1 THDN until nearly 30dB at all audio frequencies above the standard 1kHz at 5mV while the MC mode exceeded even that at 32dB ref 500µV at 1kHz at all frequencies To put this margin into perspective the output at the Pearls Tape Out jacks was more than 12V when the phono input reached its overload limitTurning to the CD input which MF found gave the best sound from the KIPearl this offered a maximum gain of 411dB measured at the speaker terminals and 171dB measured at the Preamp Out jacks both of which are typical for an integrated amplifier Neither output inverted signal polarity and the input impedance was a moderately high 20k ohms The output impedance from the Preamp Out jacks was 217 ohms at high and middle frequencies rising to 495 ohms at 20Hz From the speaker terminals the output impedance was very low at 007 ohms The modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was thus also very low Fig2 Marantz PMKIPearl frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 also shows that the Pearl offers a wide bandwidth into higher impedances which ties in with the excellent 10kHz squarewave response with short risetimes and flat tops  The output does start to roll off above 16kHz into 2 ohms however  in addition this graph was taken with the volume control set to –12dB At the controls maximum setting the Pearls output into 8 ohms  was –3dB at 80kHz rather than the 200kHz seen in fig2 The channel balance was excellent at all volumecontrol settings however and the control operated in accurate 05dB steps When switched into circuit the tone controls offered maximum swings of ±10dB at 50Hz and 20kHz  Channel separation  was good rather than great at 80dB at 1kHz while the unweighted wideband SN ratio ref 283V into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum was 57dB The latter improved to 714dB when AweightedFig3 Marantz PMKIPearl smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig4 Marantz PMKIPearl frequency response at 1V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to maximum and minimum positions Specified at 90Wpc into 8 ohms  and 140Wpc into 4 ohms  the KIPearl actually clipped at 103Wpc into 8 ohms  and 160Wpc into 4 ohms  This can be seen from fig5 which plots the THDN percentage in the amplifiers output against output power The actual distortion is buried beneath the noise below a few tens of watts so I plotted how the THDN percentage varied with frequency at a relatively high level 10V RMS equivalent to 125W into 8 ohms The results are shown in fig6 the distortion is very low in the midrange but rises at very low frequencies perhaps due to the influence of noise and both at high frequencies and into low impedances The left channel  is less good in these respects than the right  However unlike our first sample of Marantzs inexpensive PM5003 integrated amplifier  this behavior was not affected when the Pearls tone controls were in circuitFig5 Marantz PMKIPearl distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 ohmsFig6 Marantz PMKIPearl THDN  vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms At moderate levels and into higher impedances the KIPearls distortion signature comprises mostly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  Though some higherorder spuriae appear at higher powers and into lower impedances these are all still very low in level  Intermodulation distortion was also very low even at high power into 4 ohms Fig7 Marantz PMKIPearl 1kHz waveform at 13W into 8 ohms  00064 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Marantz PMKIPearl spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 72W into 4 ohms Fig9 Marantz PMKIPearl tone controls incircuit but set to flat HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 106W peak into 4 ohms The Marantz PMKIPearls excellent measured performance is a fitting tribute to Ken Ishiwata its progenitor and dedicatee
