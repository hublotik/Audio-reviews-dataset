0, Electrocompaniet AW400 I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual DomainElectrocompaniet refers to the AW400 as a Class A amplifier but the heat signature and the idling power consumption suggests that it uses a conventional classAB output stage  Electrocompaniet by running it at onethird power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes a level that maximally stresses a classB or –AB amplifiers ability to shed waste heat With the amplifier cold the THDnoise level was 0008 at the end of the preconditioning period the THDN had dropped to 00035 and the AW400s chassis was warm The only hot spots were the grilles above the internal heatsinks but these werent so hot that I couldnt keep my hand on themThe voltage gain with the input trim control at its maximum was a high 342dB and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting  The input impedance was very high at all frequencies—my estimate was 450k ohms at low and midrange frequencies compared with the specified 330k ohms but there is always a large error when measuring such high values of input impedance It did drop to 100k ohms at 20kHz though this will be inconsequentialThe output impedance is specified as being below 001 ohm which is very low However including 6 of speaker cable I measured 0135 ohm at low and midrange frequencies rising very slightly to 017 ohm at the top of the audioband This resulted in a mild ±01dB variation in the AW400s frequency response when it drove our standard simulated loudspeaker  The highfrequency rolloff was –3dB at 115kHz into 16 ohms but was negligible at 20kHz  It did increase slightly with decreasing load impedance reaching a stillmodest –04dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  As a result of this wide bandwidth the Electrocompaniets reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was nicely square Fig1 Electrocompaniet AW400 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Electrocompaniet AW400 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsEven with its high gain the AW400 was a quiet amplifier The unweighted audioband signalnoise ratio  was 869dB equivalent to a voltage of just 128µV compared with the specified 130µV  Plotting the THDN percentage against output power  indicates that the distortion lies below this noise at levels up to a few tens of watts into loads of 8 ohms and above The power at clipping with continuous drive was 425W into 8 ohms  and 655W into 4 ohms  The amplifiers protection circuit cut in at 525W into 2 ohms  which is why the top trace in fig3 ends at that point The amplifier more than met its specified power into 8 ohms but fell a bit short into 4 ohms This is because I dont hold the wall AC voltage constant during this test It was 1245V with the amplifier idling but had dropped to 1222V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohmsFig3 Electrocompaniet AW400 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  16 8 4 2 ohmsFig4 plots the THDN percentage against frequency at a level  where the distortion is beginning to rise above the noise floor All the traces start to rise in the top two audio octaves due to the amplifiers inevitable reduction in openloop bandwidth in this region but the rise is mild and the distortion remains low in level While the AW400 offers low distortion what distortion there is contains some higher harmonics  Spectral analysis of the waveform in fig5 indicates that only the second and third harmonics reach –90dB but the fourth fifth seventh and ninth lie at or above –100dB which will most likely be inaudible At higher levels  the third harmonic rises to a stilllow –84dB  and the higherorder harmonics actually decrease in level While this graph does indicate that some powersupply harmonics are present the highestlevel component at the fullwaverectified frequency of 120Hz lies at –97dB or low enough not to matter I did experiment with grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision test system to reduce the level of the powersupply spuriae this was the best I could achieveFig4 Electrocompaniet AW400 THDN  vs frequency at 127V into 16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig5 Electrocompaniet AW400 1kHz waveform at 52W into 4 ohms  0008 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 Electrocompaniet AW400 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–10kHz at 201W into 8 ohms Finally even at a level just below visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope screen the Electrocompaniet AW400 performed relatively well on the demanding highfrequency intermodulation test  The difference product at 1kHz lay at –94dB and the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz only just rose above –80dBFig7 Electrocompaniet AW400 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 401W peak into 4 ohms The Electrocompaniet AW400 offers high power coupled with low levels of noise and distortion I am not surprised Art Dudley was impressed by it
