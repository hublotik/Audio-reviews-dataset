0, Outlaw 2220 single channel amplifier   costs US 399The look is simple but elegant in its slim form factor I like that it is just heavy enough to give you confidence but not so much that you cant lift itNice set of features are provided from balanced XLR input to trigger A larger toroidal transformer indicates class class AB design Outlaw 2220 MeasurementsLets start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohmI like the very low distortion spikes that are around 108 dB or so Some power supply noise  and general noise lower SINAD down to 85 dB which is still quite competentNoise level could be a bit lower at 5 watts but still respectableMultitone test shows the very low distortion of the amplifierFrequency response is flat which is an improvement over the 2200 model which drooped at 20 kHzThe word monoblocks sets up expectations of high amount of power and the 2220 deliversThis should be plenty of power for just about any useFinally we can examine performance at different frequenciesSome strange distortion mechanism sets in at highest frequencies but only during a limited power range  Fortunately you hardly ever have content at high frequencies at high amplitude so not an audible concernConclusionsPerformance of the Outlaw 2220 is solid solid solid What can I say It delivers what you expect with nary any results that raise an eyebrow sans that high frequency distortion You have ton of power which should be handy for both stereo music listening and home theater At 399 it brings great value as wellI am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2220 monoblock amplifier
