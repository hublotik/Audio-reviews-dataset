0, Boulder 866   then repeated some tests with the magazines more recently acquired APx555 system But first  amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the top panel was very hot at 1155°F  and the heatsinks were too hot to touch at 1333°F  The Boulder amplifiers output stages appear to be biased heavily into partial classA operation Owners must make sure the amplifier has sufficient ventilation I looked first at the Boulders performance via one of its three balanced line inputs The specified maximum gain is 404dB though this can be adjusted with the frontpanel menu screen As set up by JVS the 866s maximum gain at the speaker outputs was 3075dB The volume control operated in accurate 1dB steps The amplifier preserved absolute polarity and the input XLR jacks were wired with pin 2 positive the AES standard The input impedance is specified as 100k ohms I measured 98k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and an inconsequential drop to 80k ohms at 20kHzThe Boulder amplifiers output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 016 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 019 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker load was a negligible ±02dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was down by 3dB at 100kHz which correlates with the Boulders accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  The level of the right channel in fig1 was 01dB lower than that of the left Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum neither the frequency response nor the channel matching changed at lower settings of the volume controlFig1 Boulder 866 volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Boulder 866 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was superb at 110dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 79dB at the top of the audioband The Boulders unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the balanced line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was very good at 788dB ref 283V into 8 ohms  This ratio improved to 864dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 89dB when Aweighted The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its even and oddorder harmonics  with the latter higher in level than the former  The cyan and magenta traces in this graph were taken with the volume control set to its maximum the blue and red traces with it set to 80 which is equivalent to –20dB The lower setting reduced the levels of both the random noisefloor components and the supplyrelated spuriae by around 10dB but even at the maximum setting the noise is low in levelFig3 Boulder 866 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms volume control set to maximum  and to –20dB With both channels driven the 866 slightly exceeded its specified maximum power into 8 ohms of 200Wpc  clipping at 1 THDnoise at 210Wpc  The Boulder didnt meet its specified maximum power of 400Wpc into 4 ohms  clipping at 360Wpc  However according to the manual Boulders specified maximum powers were taken with an AC wall voltage of 120V On the day  amplifier my wall voltage was 116V—I suspect that everyone on my street had their wall air conditioners operating—dropping to 1145V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms Boulder doesnt specify a maximum continuous power into 2 ohms but with one channel driven the amplifier clipped at 650W into 2 ohms  The rearpanel 8A circuit breaker operated just above this power when I performed this test Muting the 866 and pushing back the breaker button restored the amplifier to normal operationFig4 Boulder 866 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Boulder 866 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Boulder 866 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThe downward slope of the traces below the actual clipping power in figs4 and 5 is due to the actual distortion lying beneath the noisefloor  I therefore examined how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 1417V which is equivalent to 25W into 8 ohms 50W into 4 ohms and 100W into 2 ohms The left channels distortion was very low in the bass and midrange into both 8 and 4 ohms  and though it rose in the top octaves it was still below 002 The right channel had slightly more distortion into 8 ohms  and a lot more into 4 ohms  I have only shown the left channels distortion into 2 ohms  as the rearpanel circuit breaker operated while I was measuring how the right channels THDN varied with frequency into this loadFig7 Boulder 866 THDN  vs frequency at 1417V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The distortion was predominantly the subjectively benign third harmonic  though it was higher in the right channel  than the left  Some higherorder harmonics are present in both channels but these are very low in level A low level of second harmonic distortion is present in the right channel which suggests that in this channel the complementary output devices are not optimally matched  When the 866 drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50W peak into 8 ohms all the intermodulation products lay at or below –100dB  in both channels Fig8 Boulder 866 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00024 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Boulder 866 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig10 Boulder 866 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  Boulder 866s DA performance primarily using its AESEBU input repeating some tests with the TosLink SPDIF input and with the amplifier connected to my network and sent audio data by Roon The Boulder 866s optical input locked to data sampled up to 96kHz the AESEBU input up to 192kHzWith the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in a level at the loudspeaker outputs of 185V which is 69dB below the clipping voltage and equivalent to 428W into 8 ohms It appears therefore that the Boulders digital inputs have around 14dB of excess gain To avoid damaging the Boulders power amplifier with high level digital signals I performed all the measurements of the digital inputs performance with the volume control set to –20dBThe Boulders digital inputs all pre served absolute polarity The impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With white noise sampled at 441kHz  the 866s rsponse rolled off sharply above 20kHz though it didnt reach full stopband suppression until 57kHz The steep rolloff slope became shallower just above half the sample rate  An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  is barely visible above the noisefloor though the distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone can be seen including the second which was not present with the analog inputsFig11 Boulder 866 digital inputs impulse response Fig12 Boulder 866 digital inputs wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz The 866s digitalinput frequency response was flat in the audioband and follows the same basic shape with a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate  The levels of the two channels were perfectly matched When I increased the bit depth from 6 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noisefloor components dropped by around 14dB which implies that the 866 offers close to 18 bits of resolution However the noisefloor contains a large number of lowlevel powersupply–related spuriae particularly in the left channel  Pairs of lowfrequency sidebands are visible around each of the harmonic frequencies With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved With undithered 24bit data  the result was a relatively clean sinewaveFig13 Boulder

sinewave at –9031dBFS Intermodulation distortion via the Boulder amplifiers digital inputs  was a little higher than it had been with analog input signals the difference product at 1kHz lying at –89dB  compared with –101dB  866 for its rejection of wordclock jitter via its TosLink AES EBU and network inputs Though all the oddorder harmonics of the 16bit JTest signals LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were at the correct levels  the spectral spike that represents the highlevel tone at exactly onequarter the sample rate was surrounded by power supply– related sidebands All three digital inputs behaved identically in this respect The same supplyrelated sidebands were present with 24bit JTest data Fig17 Boulder 866 digital inputs highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit data  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzI investigated whether the sidebands were due to jitter or to supply noise on the DAC chips voltage reference pin by performing narrow band spectral analyses with 24bit data representing fullscale tones at 5 10 15 and 20kHz If the sidebands were due to supply noise the levels of the sidebands would remain the same at all four signal frequencies If they were due to jitter their levels would drop as the frequency of the signal reduced The levels of the sidebands were the same with all the signal frequencies so they must be due to supplyrelated spuriaeThe Boulder products that I have measured in the past have all demonstrated excellent audio engineering With the exception of the higher harmonic distortion in the right channel which may well have been due to an outofspecification output device the 866 performed well on the test bench It offers relatively high power with very low harmonic and intermodulation distortion The digital inputs generally performed well though I was a little bothered by the presence of power supply–related spuriae in figs13 and 15 I must assume that these are due to the sensitive digital circuitry sharing space in a relatively small enclosure with a massive power transformer
