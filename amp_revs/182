0,I initially measured one of the Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression Mono monoblocks     of a power amplifier I precondition it by running it at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes This power level results in the highest thermal stress on the output devices of an amplifier having a classB or classAB output stage After an hour driving 167W into 8 ohms the temperature of the Progressions top panel and heatsinks was fairly high at 1098°F  With the amplifier cold the THDnoise at this power level was 004 after the hour it had dropped to 0025The voltage gain into 8 ohms for the balanced input was 297dB and the input preserved absolute polarity the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was as specified at 100k ohms though it dropped inconsequentially at 20kHz to 70k ohms The output impedance was high for a solidstate design at 044 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 049 ohm at 20kHz Consequently the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±03dB  The amplifier offered a wide smallsignal bandwidth the output into 8 ohms  not reaching –3dB until 180kHz Consequently the Progressions reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured very short risetimes with commendably no overshoot or ringing apparentFig1 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W  and at 100W  into 8 ohms Measured with the input shorted to ground the Progression offered a wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio of 575dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This was primarily due to the presence of noise with a center frequency of 923kHz Concerned that the amplifier was picking up some RF interference that was being demodulated I turned off all the CFC and LED lights in my test lab but the noise persisted The ratio improved to 801dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 87dB when the reading was Aweighted The blue trace in fig3 taken at 1W into 8 ohms reveals that the primary source of noise is magnetic interference at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics presumably stemming from that massive toroidal transformer However at higher powers  the spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics increase in levelWhen I measured how the percentage of THDN varies with output power into 8 ohms and 4 ohms I got lower power than specified With clipping defined as when the THDN reaches 1 the Progression clipped at 460W into 8 ohms  which is 04dB lower than the specified 500W and 690W into 4 ohms  this 16dB lower than the specified 1kW into this load When I tried to test the clipping power into 2 ohms the amplifier turned itself off at 750W and just before then I could hear the amplifier acoustically buzzing and a burst of static through the FM radio I keep tuned to NPR in the test labWhen Dan DAgostino received the initial preprint of this review he was concerned that this behavior indicated that the amplifier had suffered some sort of damage on its way to me from Jason Serinus  I was therefore sent a new sample of the Progression Mono  which had been fully checked out on the test bench to testThe voltage gain input impedance and frequency response of this sample were identical to those of the first though the output impedance was slightly lower at 032 ohms and there was no RF noise present at the amplifiers output And when I examined how the percentage of THDN varies with output power this sample clipped at 595W into 8 ohms  which is 08dB higher than the 500W specification Into 4 ohms the clipping power was 934W  though this is 03dB lower than the specification I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests feeling that this is more representative of an amplifiers behavior in a typical system The wall voltage was 1201V with the amplifier idling but had dropped to 1154V at 934W into 4 ohmsFig4 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI examined how the THDN percentage varied with frequency at a fairly high level 283V which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms and 200W into 4 ohms  The results are shown in fig6 the distortion and noise remain low over most of the audioband with only relatively small rises in the top octave and into lower impedances However when waveform of the THDN after notching out the fundamental  I was surprised Although the THDN is low in this graph at 0027 you can see a double spike in the residual waveform  that coincides with every zerocrossing point in the signals waveform  This behavior suggests that the Progressions output stage lacks sufficient bias current something that I find surprising given Dan DAgostinos history of designing amplifiers with high even classA biasFig6 Dan DAgostino Progression THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms 0027 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 100W into 8 ohms a regular series of highorder harmonics can be seen correlating with the waveform of the spuriae shown in fig7 The second and third harmonics are similar in strength in this graph respectively lying at –76dB  and –80dB  The harmonic spectrum was almost identical with the amplifier driving 50Hz into 4 ohms Fig8 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Although the THDN percentage didnt rise by a great deal at high frequencies the Progression performed relatively poorly when spectrum of its output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 100W  While it is true that none of the intermodulation products is particularly high in level—the difference product at 1kHz lies at a respectable –80dB —an alarming number of higherorder intermodulation products is visible in this graph These all disappeared however when I reduced the peak level to 1W Fig9 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms Fig10 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms The Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression Mono is a powerful amplifier indeed and the measured performance of the second sample does suggest that the first sample I received had somehow suffered during its travels I was still puzzled by what appeared to be crossover distortion However it is fair to note that the Progression Mono measured very similarly to Dan DAgostinos more expensive Momentum monoblock which Michael Fremer very favorably reviewed in February 2013 and which I declared to be wellengineered
