0,The McIntosh MC501 is unusual for a solidstate amplifier in that it uses an output transformer This has three separate taps one each optimized for 8 4 and 2 ohm speakers I hooked up my 8 ohm dummy load to the MC501s 8 ohm tap and following my usual practice set the amplifier running at onethird power for one hour to see how well it would deal with thermal stress To my surprise the McIntosh shut itself off after just five minutes—the orange Power Guard LED on the front panel illuminated and the rearpanel heatsinks were too hot to touch After the amp had cooled down it turned itself on again I tried running it at a lower level just 30W into 8 ohms This time it turned itself off after 20 minutes again the heatsinks were too hot to touchThe heatsinks are relatively small for an amplifier with a continuous rating of 500W I must assume that McIntosh decided that continuous running with sinewaves would be sufficiently rare that they could economize in this area When this circumstance did arise their Sentry Monitor circuit which monitors heatsink temperature would protect the amplifier against thermal runawayMeasured via its balanced input the MC501s voltage gain was low at 233dB from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms 2064dB from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms and 168dB from the 2 ohm tap into 2 ohms Several volts will therefore be required from a balanced preamplifier to drive the Mac to its maximum output power Unusually but conforming to the specification the unbalanced gains were 6dB higher meaning that unbalanced preamplifiers will not have to deliver quite so high an output voltage Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  and the input impedance at 1kHz measured 915k ohms unbalanced 183k ohms balanced—on the low side for some capacitorcoupled tube preamplifiers such as the BAT modelsThe lowerthannormal gain is associated with an extremely low noise floor Even the wideband unweighted figure ref 1W into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm tap was 90dB switching in an Aweighting filter improved the figure to 1046dB The MC501 is one of the few amplifiers that can match the theoretical dynamic range of such hirez digital media as SACD and DVDAudioWhen  MC501s output impedance I was surprised to find it to be lowest from the 8 ohm tap at 008 ohm and highest from the 2 ohm tap at 013 ohm —the opposite of what I expected These values held from 20Hz to 1kHz there was a slight rise from all three taps at the top of the audioband to 016 ohmThese low source impedances mean that any variation in frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between them and the variation in impedance with frequency of a typical speaker will be ±01dB or less as can be seen from the top trace in fig1 This graph shows the family of responses from the 8 ohm tap The amplifiers bandwidth decreases with decreasing load impedances but when the output tap is matched to the load the 3dB point lies at 120kHz  100kHz  and 68kHz  This is superb performance for an amplifier with an output transformer As a result of this wide bandwidth the MC501s reproduction of 1kHz  and 10kHz  squarewaves was essentially perfectFig1 McIntosh MC501 8 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into  simulated

output power depended on the output tap chosen and the load but when the tap was matched to the load the amplifier easily exceeded its specified 500W at our 1 THD definition of clipping The 8 ohm tap delivered no less than 720W into 8 ohms  for example  with similar deliveries into 4 and 2 ohms from their respective taps  Despite the slight increase in source impedance the MC501s ability to deliver current into the speaker load did increase with the decreasing output transformer tap The 8 ohm tap was limited to 225W into 2 ohms  for example while the 4 ohm tap delivered 1000W  the 2 ohm tap 630W Fig4 McIntosh MC501 8 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohmsFig5 McIntosh MC501 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohmsFig6 McIntosh MC501 2 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohmsThe big power meter on the frontpanel didnt appear to be that accurately calibrated An indicated 50W was equivalent to an actual 30W into 4 ohms from the 4 ohm tap for exampleThe McIntosh also featured extremely low levels of harmonic distortion in its output Taking a clue from the plots of THDnoise percentage against power in figs46  THDN percentage against frequency at a high power level of 240W from each of the output taps into a matched load  Yes a very slight rise in THD can be seen above the audioband but the McIntosh is otherwise extremely linearFig7 McIntosh MC501 4 ohm tap THDN  vs frequency at 240W from  8 ohm tap into 8 ohms 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms 2 ohm tap into 2 ohmsWhat harmonic content is present is primarily third harmonic but as the output current increases a very small amount of higher harmonics appears at the signals zerocrossing points  Note that to even see this distortion waveform on the storage oscilloscope screen I had to run the MC501 at 480W into 4 ohms from the 4 ohm tap and average 64 individual captures to lift the harmonic content out of the noise  This superb linearity is shown in the frequency domain in fig9 the spectrum of a 50Hz sinewave driven at 470W into 4 ohms from the 8 ohm tap The third harmonic lies at just 93dB  with almost all the higher harmonics at or below 100dB Fig8 McIntosh MC501 4 ohm tap 1kHz waveform at 480W into 4 ohms  000075 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 McIntosh MC501 4 ohm tap spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz at 470W into 4 ohms Finally even at close to the MC501s specified output power the 1kHz difference component resulting from an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones lay below 100dB —extraordinarily good performance from any amplifier let alone from one with an output transformerFig10 McIntosh MC501 4 ohm tap HF intermodulation spectrum DC24kHz 1920kHz at 500W into 4 ohms I thought the McIntosh amplifiers sounded simply superb when I auditioned them in Paul Bolins system in the spring Nothing in the MC501s measured performance causes me to doubt what I heard
