0,VTLs Siegfried Series II Reference has both balanced and singleended inputs and can be operated in tetrode or triode outputstage modes each with four levels of negative feedback Because fully characterizing its performance in every one of the 16 possible conditions would be very time consuming I performed a limited set of measurements in all 16 and then a more complete set using the balanced input and in both triode and tetrode modes each with minimum and maximum feedback—which VTL respectively calls Low Damping Factor  and Max Damping Factor  I used my topoftheline  system The Siegfried IIs balanced and unbalanced inputs both preserved absolute polarity  with the rearpanel Phase switch set to 0 and offered the same voltage gain In triode mode  the gain ranged from 301dB with MDF to 338dB with LDF Gain in tetrode mode  was a little higher at 317dBMDF and 365dBLDF The balanced input impedance was a usefully high 90k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to a stillhigh 76k ohms at 20kHz As expected the singledended input impedances were half the balanced figuresWith its dozen 6550 output tubes the Siegfried IIs output impedance was low for a tubed design The lowest impedance was in triodeMDF mode at 088 ohm in the midband and 09 ohm at the extremes of the audioband As a result the variation in the amplifiers frequency response due to the interaction of this impedance with that of our standard simulated loudspeaker remained within ±05dB limits  This graph also indicates that the Siegfried II rolls off cleanly above the audioband reaching –3dB at 130kHz into 8 ohms  The output impedance rose a little with each reduction of feedback reaching 136 ohms at 1kHz and 14 ohms at the frequency extremes in the LDF condition when the response variation was ±1dB and the HF rolloff was now –3dB at 80kHz  The output impedance in tetrode mode was only slightly higher than in triode mode varying from 09 ohms at 1kHzMDF to 153 ohms 1kHzLDF The variations in response with our simulated loudspeaker were therefore of the same order  but the ultrasonic response was more extended in tetrode mode with the –3dB point into 8 ohms varying from 200kHzMDF  to 150kHzLDFFig1 VTL Siegfried II Reference triodeMDF frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 VTL Siegfried II Reference triodeLDF frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig3 VTL Siegfried II Reference tetrodeMDF frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Perhaps more important in tetrodeMDF the ultrasonic rolloff has a sharper corner that correlates with the small degree of overshoot and damped oscillation in the Siegfried IIs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave in this condition  For comparison fig5 shows the VTLs reproduction of the 10kHz squarewave in triodeLDF The waveform is superbly square with no incipient instability and the 1kHz squarewave in this mode is essentially perfect  These last two graphs are a testament to the quality of the Siegfrieds output transformerFig4 VTL Siegfried II Reference tetrodeMDF smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig5 VTL Siegfried II Reference triodeLDF smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig6 VTL Siegfried II Reference triodeLDF smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsWith its high gain even with MDF the Siegfried II is not the quietest highpower amplifier I have measured The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio measured with the input shorted and ref 1W into 8 ohms varied from 754dB in tetrodeLDF to 817dB in triodeLDF Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these ratios by a couple of dB while switching in an Aweighting filter gave ratios of 832dB in tetrodeLDF 853dB in triodeLDF 879dB in tetrodeMDF and 895dB in triodeMDF Spectral analysis of the amplifiers lowfrequency noise floor  indicated that the primary source of noise was magnetic interference from the AC transformer at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics though its fair to note that even the highestlevel component at 180Hz is still down by 85dB from the 1W output level and will not be audibleFig7 VTL Siegfried II Reference spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms VTL specifies their amplifiers rated powers into 5 ohms which is awkward for reviewers our test loads come in multiples of 4 ohms I therefore measured the Siegfried IIs maximum power into 4 and 8 ohms in tetrode and triode modes each with LDF and MDF The clipping power  wasnt affected by the amount of feedback though the percentage of THD was a little higher below clipping with LDF Fig8 shows how the THDN varies with output power into 8 ohms with the Siegfried II set to triodeLDF The distortion is very low at low powers starts to rise above the noise floor above a few hundred milliwatts remains less than 01 below 25W and reaches 1 at 250W  Fig9 shows the 4 ohm behavior again in triodeLDF The amplifier now clips at 315W  but the distortion is still respectably low at lower powers Fig10 shows the Siegfried IIs behavior into 8 ohms in tetrodeLDF The lowpower distortion is even lower than in triode mode and the amplifier now clips at 425W  Into 4 ohms in tetrode mode  the Siegfried clipped at 600W Fig8 VTL Siegfried II Reference triodeLDF distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8

ohmsFig11 VTL Siegfried II Reference tetrodeLDF distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFigs 12 and 13 show how the percentage of THDN varies with frequency into 8 4 and 2 ohms at a level where I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise Fig12 shows the behavior in triodeLDF fig13 in tetrodeLDF The 8 ohm distortion  was low in both modes with tetrode slightly lower overall There is also only a slight rise in THD toward the top of the audioband But as the load impedance drops the THD rises overall and the increase at high frequencies rises further Comparing these two graphs and looking at the graphs taken with MDF  suggests that while the Siegfried II offers the lowest measured distortion in tetrodeMDF the amplifier deals better with low impedances in triode mode at all DF settingsFig12 VTL Siegfried II Reference triodeLDF THDN  vs frequency at 634V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig13 VTL Siegfried II Reference tetrodeLDF THDN  vs frequency at 9V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Also to be considered is the fact that in triode mode the distortion in the midrange is primarily the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  while in tetrode mode some higherorder harmonics appear  The differences are more pronounced at low frequencies and higher powers In triode mode  the second and third harmonics are equally strong at –60dB  each while in tetrode mode  the third and fifth harmonics are strongest at respectively –52dB  and –68dB Fig14 VTL Siegfried II Reference triodeLDF 1kHz waveform at 13W into 8 ohms 0024 THDN

Despite its decreasing linearity at high frequencies and at high powers the Siegfried II performed relatively well when tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level a few dB below visual clipping on an oscilloscope Fig18 was taken in triodeLDF into 4 ohms which was the worst case Even so the 1kHz difference component lies at –53dB  and the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz are a couple of dB lower in levelFig18 VTL Siegfried II Reference triodeLDF HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms VTLs Siegfried Series II Reference is large and massive and its measured performance shows that it is indeed a powerhouse Even with its negative feedback set to its minimum the amplifier still offers low levels of distortion at the kinds of power levels likely to be seen in practice Though the best linearity is to be obtained in tetrode mode the spectral signature of the distortion and the way in which the amplifiers behavior changes with decreasing load impedance suggests that triode mode will be preferred
