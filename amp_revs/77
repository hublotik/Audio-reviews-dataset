0,After running for one hour at 13 power the Rotel RB1090s case was quite hot but not abnormally so DC offset measured 18mV in the left channel 11mV in the right The amplifier is noninverting with pin 2 positive in its balanced mode Voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 288dB  Unless noted otherwise all  with the amplifier running in unbalanced modeThe RB1090s input impedance measured 332k ohms  The maximum measured output impedance was 016 ohms at 20kHz into a 4 ohm load this decreasing to less than 01 ohm at 1kHz This is not unusually low for a solidstate amplifier but low enough that any effect on the amplifiers frequency response with a real load will be small The signalnoise readings  were 94dB from 22Hz to 22kHz 86dB from 10Hz to 500kHz and 94dB Aweighted The corresponding balanced values were 82dB 75dB and 83dBThe amplifiers frequency response is shown in fig1 Only the small  dip at 5kHz distinguishes the response with a  loudspeaker load from that with pure resistance The 10kHz squarewave  is as good as any weve seen with a fast risetime only a slight rounding of the leading edge  and no overshoot or ringing Like the SN readings the crosstalk in fig3 is slightly worse in balanced mode but nevertheless low enough to be audibly irrelevantFig1 Rotel RB1090 frequency response at  2W into 4 ohms 1W into 8 ohms and 2828V into simulated loudspeaker load Fig2 Rotel RB1090 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Rotel RB1090 channel separation vs frequency  R–L L–R balanced L–R R–L unbalanced The THDnoise percentage vs frequency behavior is shown in figs4 and 5 Measured distortion is higher in balanced mode  but nevertheless still respectably low The THD waveform in fig6 into 4 ohms indicates a predominant third harmonic plus noise Fig7 shows the distortion spectrum of a 50Hz input signal at an output of 23 rated power  into 4 ohms The only distortion artifact above –80dB  is the third harmonic at 150Hz  Fig8 plots the IM distortion of a 1920kHz waveform at 383W into 4 ohms Again only one component is higher than –80dB the artifact at 18kHz  The distortion at 23 power into 8 ohms  is even lower These are very fine resultsFig4 Rotel RB1090 THDnoise  vs frequency at  4W into 2 ohms 2W into 4 ohms 283V into simulated loudspeaker load and 1W into 8 ohms Fig5 Rotel RB1090 THDnoise  vs frequency at  1W into 8 ohms and 2W into 4 ohms balanced 2W into 4 ohms and 1W into 8 ohms unbalanced Fig6 Rotel RB1090 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig7 Rotel RB1090 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 469W into 4 ohms Fig8 Rotel RB1090 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–22kHz 1920kHz at 383W into 4 ohms Because the RB1090 is rated only into a minimum power of 4 ohms and also to avoid thermal risk to our testbench load I ran the continuous THDnoise vs output power curves only into 4 and 8 ohms As fig9 shows there is clearly no shortage of power with this amp I also ran discrete clipping measurements with a continuous signal but only into 8 ohms again because of testload limits Into 8 ohms both channels driven the Rotel clipped  at 407W  in the left channel  and 410W  in the right  With one channel driven clipping occurred at 437W Fig9 Rotel RB1090 distortion  vs continuous output power into  8 ohms and 4 ohmsJohn Atkinson tested the amplifier into lower impedances using a lowdutycycle 1kHz toneburst generated by the Miller Audio Research Amplifier Profiler The results are shown in fig10 and even though the amplifier is working harder into 2 ohms  and 1 ohm  than it is into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  the overall distortion level is still very low The clipping characteristic is quite soft with a relatively gradual increase in THD up to the 1 point This will make the amplifier tend to sound more powerful except the big Rotel doesnt need help in that respect with the toneburst and one channel driven it delivers 527W into 8 ohms and a whopping 2825W into 1 ohmFig10 Rotel RB1090 distortion  vs 1kHz burst output power into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  and 1 ohm Altogether a solid set of testbench results from the Rotel RB1090—Thomas J Norton
