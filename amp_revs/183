0, Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual DomainThe VK55SE has four output terminals for each channel various pairs of which can be used to provide a feed from three different outputtransformer taps these are labeled High  Med  and Low  I performed a complete set of measurements from each tap but have concentrated on the High and Low outputs in this discussion as the Med output was not that different from the High in most respectsThe amplifiers maximum voltage gain was lower than usual at 24dB into 8 ohms from the High and Med outputs and 23dB from the Low though there was a little more experimental error in these figures than usual because of a slight history effect ie the actual gain somewhat depended on the signal behavior When I increased the signal level of a sinewave tone for example the level of the output signal drifted down by a few millivolts over a period of several seconds before stabilizing at the new steadystate value Each output tap was noninverting  with pin 2 of the XLR jacks wired hot The input impedance was very high—a good thing—at 250k ohms at 1kHz increasing slightly at the frequency extremesAs with the standard VK55  the output impedance from the VK55SEs High and Med taps was high at 27 ohms in the midrange rising to almost 3 ohms at high and low frequencies As expected the output impedance was somewhat lower from the Low tap at just under 2 ohms at high and midrange frequencies with only a slight rise to 21 ohms at 20Hz As a result of the Ohms Law interaction between the high output impedances with the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker the amplifiers frequency response into this load varied by ±17dB from the Med and High taps  and ±12dB from the Low tap  These variations in response will be audible Into resistive loads the VK55SE offered a flat response in the audioband with excellent channel matching and a wide smallsignal bandwidth Even into 2 ohms  the ultrasonic response didnt reach –3dB until 90kHz which results in a very square squarewave response  The waveforms risetimes are very short and commendably there is only a slight hint of overshoot and no ringing The VK55SE uses wellmade output transformersFig1 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE High output tap

ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig3 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE High output tap smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was superb at 100dB in both directions below 3kHz The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the input shorted was good at 787dB ref 1W into 8 ohms improving to 965dB when Aweighted The figures were taken from the Low output the Med and High outputs were about 08dB worseSpecified as having a maximum output power of 55Wpc into 8 ohms  the VK55SE delivered exactly this power into 8 ohms from its High tap at 1 THDnoise as can be seen in fig4 which plots the THDN percentage against output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms from this tap The 4 ohms delivery was the same while into 2 ohms this tap delivered 38W  The steady rise in THD with power before actual waveform clipping is reached suggests that this amplifier uses only a modest amount of loop negative feedback The Med tap delivered slightly more power at 1 THDN into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  but the same 38W into 4 ohms Fig5 plots the THDN percentage against output power from the Low tap The lowlevel distortion is lower than from the other two taps and though less power is available at clipping into 8 ohms—40Wpc 16dBW—this tap does behave a little more like a voltage source with 64W available into 4 ohms and 59W into 2 ohms  The Low tap will be the one to use with loudspeakers that offer an awkward impedance such as the Thiel CS37s used by Wes Phillips for some of his auditioningFig4 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE High output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsFig5 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE Low output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsThe two channels differed in their smallsignal linearity and noise level perhaps because the review samples tubes had much mileage on them For example figs 6 and 7 plot the THDN percentage against frequency from the High and Low taps respectively The right channel  offered lower distortionnoise in the midrange and treble than the left  However while the left and right channels were not significantly different at low frequencies from the High tap the left channel offered significantly less distortion below 100Hz than the right from the Low tapFig6 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE High output tap THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE Low output tap THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms This can be seen in fig8 which shows the spectrum of the VK55SEs Lowtap output at a modest power into 8 ohms A regular series of both odd and evenorder harmonics can be seen but these are each about 12dB lower in the left channel  than the right  If this spectrum had been predominantly oddorder harmonics I would have suspected an undersized core in the rightchannel transformer but as the highestlevel harmonic is the second perhaps it was due to a tube mismatch At higher frequencies and lower levels the third harmonic dominates Fig8 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE Low output tap spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–10kHz at 10W into 8 ohms Fig9 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE High output tap 1kHz waveform at 34W into 4 ohms  0248 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Finally as implied by the fact that the distortion percentage doesnt rise at the top of the audioband in figs 6 and 7 the VK55SE did quite well on the demanding twintone highfrequency intermodulation test  At a level from the Low tap just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen the 1kHz difference tone was the highest in level at –57dB  though a series of higherorder products can also be seen at lower levels The higherfrequency tones were surrounded by sideband pairs at ±120Hz and its harmonics suggesting that the amplifiers power supply is being stressed under these conditions even though the actual 120Hz component lies at a low –95dB Fig10 Balanced Audio Technology VK55SE Low output tap HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms Overall the VK55SE is as well engineered as I have come to expect from Balanced Audio Technology Certainly it sounds as good as WP describes as I found out when I drove from its Low outputtransformer tap the Aerial Model 20Tv2 loudspeakers currently residing in my listening room But some aspects of the VK55SEs measured performance bothered me particularly the difference between the channels lowfrequency linearity from the Low tap—and it is only fair to point out that the SE measures no better than the plainJane VK55
