0, Emotiva BasX series A500 five channel home theater amplifier The A500 costs US 529 which seems reasonable given the functionality and ratingsI cant say that I find the A500 attractive but is not ugly eitherHere is the connectivity which sadly does not include balanced XLR connectionsThis is a Class AB amplifier with a rather larger toroidal transformer It is not overly heavy though which my back appreciatedThe heatsinks end well below the top of the case so it was hard to judge how warm it got by touching the case A quick test with IR temperature sensor showed the heatsinks running around 50 degrees CIn use the A500 never complained shut down or go into thermal protection This is nice benefit over the delicate amplifiers in AVRs which if you look at them wrong they go into protectionshut down Clearly this is much more robust solutionAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts outputI was surprised by two things large channel disparity with respect to distortion  and very high mains hum at 60 Hz No amount of playing with grounding fixed the latter which tells me the 60 Hz is probably induced from the transformer into the amplifier section The former channel distortion parity varied with which channel you used Channels 1 2 and 4 were very close and good Channels 3 and 5 lagged way behind The good channels had their SINAD actually dominated by that mains hum and power supply noise not distortion   The situation was reversed for the bad channelsAveraging all the channels we get a middle of the road scoreSignal to noise ratio reflected the above issue with aweighting resulting in substantial improvement of SNROur threshold of heaving in low frequencies is quite high so this is not as big of a problem audibly as it is in measurementsFrequency response was very good almost ruler flat in audible band and going beyond 100 kHz at 3 dBCrosstalk between channels 1 and 4 were rather disappointingIt is closer to a 29 amplifier than our state of the art Benchmark AHB2The meat of the review is power measurements versus distortion So lets get into that at 8 ohmsNice to see the massive improvement relative to a higher end AVR  but as soon as distortion takes over that advantage is sadly lost We do get a few more watts though than our AVRHere is the same measurement with 4 ohm loadLets sweep from 20 kHz to 20 Hz and see how much power we get with THDN set to 01 We see a small drop in power at the extremes which is goodSome of you have been demanding that I work harder and measure performance with more than two channels So here you goI could not get the amplifier to distort less than 01 with 4 channels regardless of output level So I stepped that up to 02 to get the third graph I could have been watching a movie instead of running these extra tests so I hope you are happyConclusionsThe Emotiva BasX A500 seems to be a decent shot at building a 5 channel amplifier for a very decent price Yes it is a bit of a gamble how good each channel is and how audible that mains hum can become Other than that it is a definite step up very amplifiers in AVRsOverall I can recommend the A500 if you are on a budget and have a bad back stopping you from lifting something heavier As always questions comments corrections etc are welcomeDo you work on weekends I didnt think so As you see I am working having produced two reviews instead of enjoying the last bit of sunshine we are having So please reach deep in your pocket and empty every dollar you have in my coffers using
