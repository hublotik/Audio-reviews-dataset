0, Boulder 865s measured behavior using mainly Stereophiles loaner sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain s on an amplifier I run it for 60 minutes at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage The Boulders top panel was quite warm at the end of this period but soon thereafter the amplifier turned itself off due presumably to thermal overload Following that it turned itself on then off and so on indicating that its heatsinks thermal capacity is only just enough to pass this test It is extremely unlikely that this will lead to any practical problems Still those using an 865 in hometheater systems would be well advised not to place it in a closet without adequate ventilationThe 865s maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms from its speaker terminals was a high 4585dB and the volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps The maximum gain from the Auxiliary linelevel output was a fairly high 20dB sourced from an output impedance of 984 ohms Both speaker and Auxiliary outputs preserved absolute polarity ie were noninverting with pin 2 of the XLR jacks wired as hot The 865s input impedance was a high 63k ohms at 1kHz rising to 84k ohms at 20Hz and 73k ohms at 20kHzThe Boulders output impedance was a low 007 ohm at low and midrange frequencies this rising slightly to 01 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modification of the 865s frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between it and the source impedance of our simulated loudspeaker  remained within ±01dB limits The 865s smallsignal bandwidth is wide at –3dB at 90kHz and commendably didnt change with different volumecontrol settings The amplifiers increasing source impedance in the top octave and above did reduce the ultrasonic bandwidth slightly but the Boulders reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was nicely square with no overshoot or ringing  The 1kHz squarewave performance was nigh on perfect Fig1 Boulder 865 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Boulder 865 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was excellent measured with the volume control at 00dB  at better than 90dB in both directions below 1kHz and still better than 80dB at 20kHz The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  was good but not great at 626dB this improving to 693dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 718dB when Aweighted This is not as good as the specified unweighted figure of 108dB ref 150W into 8 ohms which is equivalent to 862dB ref 283VFig3 plots the percentage of THDnoise in the Boulder 865s output while it drove an increasing level of a 1kHz tone into 8 4 and 2 ohms The amplifier easily exceeded its specified maximum continuous power of 150Wpc into 8 ohms not clipping  until 194W  with both channels driven It just met the specified peak output power of 300Wpc into 4 ohms delivering 308Wpc at 1 THD  With one channel driven into 2 ohms the amplifier turned itself off at 467W into 2 ohms  as indicated by the truncated upper trace in fig3 The Boulder turned itself on again after I reduced the input level but some residual crossover distortion was now apparent in its output Cycling the amplifier off then on again eliminated the crossover artefacts but this behavior does suggest the 865 not be driven to high levels into low impedances of 2 ohms and belowFig3 Boulder 865 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 ohmsI plotted the THDN percentage against frequency at a level of 16V into 8 ohms or 32W  Though the measurement is dominated by noise below 4kHz or so into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  the THD does start to rise out of that noise above that frequency if not to any significant level Into 2 ohms however the distortion rises considerably above 1kHz and the amplifier again shut itself off at the end of the time it took to take this measurement into that impedance  which again suggests that the 865 is not optimized for driving impedances lower than 4 ohmsFig4 Boulder 865 THDN  vs frequency at 16V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The waveform of that distortion is dominated by the subjectively innocuous second and third harmonics —note how even at the fairly high power level in this graph the waveform is dominated by noise—though spectral analysis indicates that some higherorder harmonics are present  The right channel is not quite as linear as the left and in fig6 you can also see some powersupply–related spuriae below 1kHz Though these components are all at a very low level I couldnt eliminate them by experimenting with grounding and they do contribute to the worsethanspecified SN ratio Halving the load impedance to 4 ohms but keeping the input voltage constant gave the spectrum shown in fig7 The distortion components havent risen by much but the spectral line representing the 1kHz tone now has sidebands apparent at the supplyrelated frequency of ±120Hz and its harmonics The amplifier is obviously under strain at this high a power into 4 ohms even though it doesnt actually clip for another couple of dBFig5 Boulder 865 1kHz waveform at 935W into 4 ohms  00044 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 Boulder 865 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 105W into 8 ohms Fig7 Boulder 865 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 203W into 4 ohms The Boulder 865 did well on the demanding highlevel highfrequency intermodulation test  Though some higherorder components can be seen these are all at a low level and the 1kHz difference component lies at –110dB  which isnt going to disturb any listeners equanimityFig8 Boulder 865 HF
