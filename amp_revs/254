0, Fosi Audio BT20A stereo class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 IC  costs US 9999 with 32 volt power supplyDespite its low cost the case gives a feeling of quality I am not usually fan of tone controls in low cost amps because you can never set them to flat response  As you will in the measurements Fosi has made sure that they work correctly in this instance A stout power switch controls power In addition to 32 volt supply company also shipped the optional  48 volt supply which is quite a giantAs you see Bluetooth input is also supportedFYI there is an included orange volume control knob to give the unit some colorFosi Audio BT20A Pro MeasurementsThe tests are in 48 volt unless I say otherwise  Here is our dashboardNotice the great channel match in addition to very good SINAD which represents noise and distortion Same is true with 32 volt supplyThis nicely lands the BT20A Pro in the very good category of all amplifiers tested regardless of priceZooming in to see the competitionSNR is good for the classI expect loadimpedance dependency in this class of switching amplifiers but here the peaking is almost entirely out of band which is goodSeeing how you have tone controls anyway you could tailor any peaking with adjustment of the treble control Wont be exact but should be good enoughThat aside note how the response is more or less is flat in audible band with the treble and bass controls set to their detent center positionMultitone is good enough for the classCrosstalk is very goodLets start our 4 ohm power measurements with 48 volt supplyWow this little box can pump out some serious watts albeit in the short term testing Switching to 32 volts cuts this down even though 4 ohm is mostly current limitedThe larger power supply must have more capacitor reservoirs than the 32 voltSwitching to 8 ohm we naturally see the biggest hit to power Although to be fair I put the cursor at an earlier point than for 48 volt supply I was pleasantly surprised by the transfer function being so smoothFinally there is not much of a pop on but there is for offConclusionsThe TI TPA3255 seems to be a capable platform when paired with a good implementation which is what we have in BT20A Pro You get a sense of that in company marketing material which includes Audio Precision measurements Usability is excellent with high quality case and controls especially with respect to ability to set the tone controls to flatIt is also nice to see so much power coming out of this little box with the beefy 48 volt power supply showcasing the advancements in amplification density we have todayAs an aside the company has been a joy to work with They were exceptionally polite cordial and patient as I went through my testing and evaluation They tell me they have internal RD team and it showsI am happy to add the Fosi Audio BT20A Pro to my recommended list
