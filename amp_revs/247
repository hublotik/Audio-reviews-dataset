0, allinone Marantz HDAMP1 DAC and integrated amplifier   retails for USD 1100 including free Prime shipping from AmazonThe unit has a somewhat retro looking of other Marantz audio products with the round digital display and wood sidesThere are both digital inputs and analog allowing one to build a complete system around the HDAMP1 I was surprised to not see RCA outputs though so no convenient way to use its internal DAC by itselfAmplification is through classD technology which allowed the unit to run cool Without permission from its owner though I did not put it through thermal stressIn addition to speaker output there is also a headphone jack so  output through that tooThere is a lot of functionality in HDAMP1 I chose to test a few of them in this feature and will test more based on requestsMeasurementsI started by testing the DACheadphone stage using our usual dashboardAs you see I set the output to 2 volt which is the nominal output of standalone DACs Alas performance is nothing to write home about Second harmonic distortion is quite high setting the SINAD at just 85 dB This would put in the fourth quadrant of DACs tested  We also have fair bit of harmonic spikes from the power supply from 180 Hz and up Loading down the headphone output with 300 ohm we get thisThere are internal gain settings but I did not mess with them As it is level of noise and distortion is quite high relative to desktop DACamp products Power output however is decentSwitching to the power amplifier here is the power versus distortionnoise measurementI have plotted three graphs using three different volume controls with input being swept up to 2 volts Distortion climbs less steeply than other amps so hard to know where to stop and measure the wattage I selected a conservative point and got 47 watts I believe the rating from Marantz is 70 watts using my 4 ohm load  You could certainly get there and beyond if you tolerate more distortionAs I have noted the performance is similar to budget amplifiers like NuForce STA200  but not even remotely getting close to our best in class Hypex NC400 amplifier  Best case performance is about SINAD of 72 dB or soAbove is with my 40 kHz AES17 filter by the wayFrequency response was very good for a class D amplifierAnd here is the broadband spectrum analysis of a 1 kHz toneThe first large spike comes at nearly 500 kHz which I am assuming is the switching frequency of its classD amplifier Its second harmonic is at nearly 1 Mhz and down 60 dBFinally here is the harmonic distortionnoise versus frequency at 5 watts of output using 90 kHz of bandwidthOnce again it is not on the same planet as the Hypex NC400 It also has instability when the analyzer switches its frequency as indicated by the T symbols It takes some 5 seconds for the readings to become stable We saw this in the Behringer A500 amplifier reviewConclusionsI wanted to like the Marantz HDAMP1 It has been in demand for quite a while on the forum to measure it Having done that I see no signs of excellence It follows the drifting backward industry trend of good enough performance specs This is reflected in lack of hardly any specifications provided by Marantz On feature side it is very strange that there is no RCA outputs to use the DAC and preamp with a different power amplifierNeedless to say I cant recommend the Marantz HDAMP1
