0, darTZeel NHB108 model two —see the January 2008 As We See It I performed the measurements using the balanced  and singleended  inputs and left the internal jumpers as they had been set To avoid triggering the amplifiers protection circuitry I turned it off before changing the inputs during the measurements  Before starting the testing I followed the CEAs recommendation by preconditioning the amplifier for 30 minutes at oneeighth the maximum power into 8 ohms At the end of that time the sidemounted heatsinks were hot at 1133°F  After an additional 10 minutes at onethird power into 8 ohms the heatsink temperature had risen to 1216°F  The NHB108 model two needs to be wellventilatedThe darTZeels voltage gain into 8 ohms was a low 2015dB from the balanced inputs but as with the NHB468 monoblock that Michael Fremer reviewed in November 2019 the unbalanced gain was 6dB higher The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  for both XLR and RCA inputs The balanced and unbalanced input impedances are specified as 30k ohms I measured 20k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz for the balanced inputs which is still usefully high and 24k ohms for the unbalanced inputs at 20Hz and 1kHz 16k ohms at 20kHzAlthough the NHB108 model twos output impedance is specified as 033 ohms my estimate including the series impedance of 6 of spacedpair cable was slightly higher at 0435 ohms at 20Hz 0455 ohms at 1kHz and 0465 ohms at 20kHz Consequently the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±026dB  The audioband response into impedances of 2 ohms and above was flat up to 20kHz and the output into 8 ohms  was down by just 05dB at 200kHz As with the other darTZeel amplifiers that have been reviewed in Stereophile the NHB108 model two has a wide smallsignal bandwidth its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringingFig1 darTZeel NHB108 model two frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 darTZeel NHB108 model two smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe darTZeels wideband unweighted SN ratio ref 283V into 8 ohms and measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground was an excellent 867dB in the left channel and 814dB in the right These ratios improved to a superb 994dB and 955dB respectively when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 1018dB and 991dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the darTZeels noisefloor  revealed that the spuriae related to the powerline frequency were all very low in level The levels of these spuriae didnt change when I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and analyzerFig3 darTZeel NHB108 model two spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms The NHB108 model twos maximum power is specified as 150W into 8 ohms  and 225W into 4 ohms  With clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 the darTZeel with both channels driven slightly exceeded its specified powers into both impedances It clipped at 155Wpc into 8 ohms  and at 230Wpc into 4 ohms  The NHB108 model twos maximum power is not specified into 2 ohms I didnt test the amplifiers maximum power into that load as I broke the original version when I attempted to do soFig4 darTZeel NHB108 model two distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 darTZeel NHB108 model two distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI measured how the darTZeel amplifiers THDN percentage varied with frequency at a fairly high level 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms Though the distortion is relatively high in level into both impedances fig6 reveals that the NHB108s distortion doesnt increase with frequency which is commendable considering that the NHB108 model two has no global negative feedbackFig6 darTZeel NHB108 model two THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The waveform of the residual distortion and noise with a 1kHz signal at 50W into 8 ohms  is smooth which English audio engineer Ben Duncan has suggested correlates with good sound quality This graph suggests that the subjectively benign second harmonic is dominant which was confirmed by spectral analysis with a 50Hz tone  though higherorder harmonics are present at lower levels Other than a proportional increase in the levels of the harmonics when I repeated this analysis at the same voltage into 4 ohms the spectrum was identical Fig7 darTZeel NHB108 model two 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0118 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 darTZeel

spectrum as I reduced the level in stages down to 1Wpc into 8 ohms As you can see from fig10 though the higherorder harmonics progressively disappear as the power is reduced the level of the second harmonic remains constant at around –60dB  Repeating this series of spectral analyses at different signal frequencies gave the same result The NHB108 model twos distortion signature is independent of input frequency and output voltage while the level of the distortion products increases as the output current increase this distortion signature doesnt changeFig10 darTZeel NHB108 model two spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms It was only when I performed my usual highfrequency intermodulation test with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones that the NHB108 model two stumbled a little With a peak signal level of 50W into 8 ohms the secondorder difference product lay at –60dB  Although many higherorder products can be seen almost all of these lie at or below –80dB Fig11 darTZeel NHB108 model two HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms The darTZeel NHB108 model twos measured performance is very similar to that of the original version of the amplifier which John Marks and Wes Phillips favorably reviewed in September 2003 and April 2005 respectively Yes the distortion is relatively high in level which will be due to the designers decision not to use any global negative feedback But I keep coming back to the independence of the amplifiers transfer function from the input signal I have long felt that this behavior is related to good sound quality I will be interested to read what JVS thought of the darTZeels sound
