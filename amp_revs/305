0, Topping PA3 desktop amplifier I have had a ton of requests to measure this amplifier so I asked the company to send me one They said they would do so but cautioned me that it would not measure well The PA3 costs US 120 on Amazon including free shippingI must stay compared to all the budget amplifiers I have tested the PA3 looks like luxury goods It comes in a hefty case and oozes qualityThere are dual inputs as you see which you can control using the power button A massive Topping branded external power supply is provided which even goes as far as having textured design on the back sideMost importantly all the regulatory certifications are there which we know from past examination to be true and certified by thirdparty labs This is one budget amplifier I wouldnt hesitate to leave on unattendedImplementation is based on TDA7498E ST Micro chip amp Topping PA3 MeasurementsLets start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm using 1 kHz toneAs you see I adjusted the volume control to give us the nominal 29 dB gain I usually test at SINAD is dominated by distortion which at 0036 which correlates well with ST Micros 005 spec at 1 watt Alas this is well below average for all amplifiers we have tested and some of the latest chip amp productsSNR slots in the same bucket of performanceCrosstalk is pretty good showing good attention to isolationFrequency response unfortunately is very load dependentWe get about 51 watts into 4 ohm with both channels driven with distortion dominating Power naturally drops with 8 ohm load but not as much some others I have seenPeak power matches company spec which is a novelty in this spaceNote that there was a really strong protection circuit that would not allow me to push the amp more than I did for max power so I had to settle for lower distortion of 05 It would shut down if I told it to work harder to hit 1Distortion takes off rather quickly with frequency as we see in multitone testSame is see in our frequency versus power and distortionnoiseFortunately our hearing threshold starts to go up at higher frequencies so audibility is less impacted than our sensibility about good engineeringConclusionsIt is clear that Topping did what it could to build a reliable safe and robust desktop platform for this amplifier Alas they are held down significantly by the performance of the underlying chip amp which is likely all that was available at the time this product was designed Being selfish elitist audiophile engineering types that we are we have no choice but to pass on this amplifier If you are not picky however and want something that is build safe and well you could choose otherwiseSo to repeat I cant recommend the Topping PA3 based on its audio performance Hopefully there are future products based on a better platform
