Marantz PM90 Vintage stereo integrated amplifier It purchased member japan drop shipped testing It came 1991 price 160000 Yen I looked online I find one US 950 beat unitI must say one nice looking amplifier look would fit even todayThe feel controls excellent volume control I found bit loose A flip door gives additional control including switching Class AB Class A mode operation Sadly requires unit powered change opportunity instant switching comparisonI pleasantly surprised see modern beefy speaker terminals wellEven interesting inclusion XLR balanced inputs CDThis amplifier back breakingly heavy due use two massive transformers It limit I could lift carry two flight stairs testing Sitting back aches thinking reverse trip pack darn thing Speaking packing immaculately double boxed HifiDo zero impact despite long journey Apparently even came one year warranty although ship back Japan thatSpeaking Japan unit made market hence 100 volt rating opposed 120 volts US If mine I would go ahead use 120 someone elses hard replace I powered Lab AC generator Variac set 100 volts This may caused measurement issues I noted belowMarantz PM90 Amplifier MeasurementsThere lot test due dual mode operation dual type input Lets start Class A operation RCA XLRUnfortunately measurements polluted high mains noise harmonics I tried every way could reduce impact much Whether due design amplifier longer AC mains connection due use lab AC gen Variac I cant tell As SINAD doesnt appear better modern AVRs Marantz front plateHowever look FFT see two harmonics disappears noise Here performance Marantz SR7015 referenceNoise power supply lower aids getting similar SINADSwitching Class AB mode penaltyIf anything distortion harmonics go bit lower although reliableTo see difference Class AB Class A I turned residual mode Audio Precision scope display This shows us difference input output waveforms If zero crossing error due class AB operation see difference around part waveform dontWhat mostly power supply noise I changed frequencies power level 1 watt still saw nothing would correlate zero crossing distortion class A supposed solve Feedback class AB operation seem cured ailment leaving little room Class A betterHere comparison Class AB Class A respect signal noise ratioClass AB pulls ahead full power mode create power At baseline 5 watts similar likely limited power supply noiseCrosstalk showed tiny improvement favor class A materialBandwidth good exceptionalNotice amplifier gain changes switch modes listening tests may compensate thatClass AB course tons powerOverall shape graph average Wanting see impact preamp vs power amp I separated two fed unit analyzer direct using RCAAs expected analyzer cleaner impact distortion noise bit surprising As one channel worse SINAD reaches almost 100 dB near full power good channel niceThere lot headroom using class AB vs Class ATesting amplifier linearity vs frequency getClass A power limits 20 Hz Class AB Both show predictable smooth responses greatMultitone tests shows slightly lower distortion higher frequencies favor Class AEffectiveness feedback lowers higher frequencies likely reason class A better thereMarantz PM90 Phono Input MeasurementsIt hard figure fair way measure performance phono stage compare standalone devices At first I used tape output didnt produce great response Best preamp tap power ampSadly mains noise dwarfs SINAD There sign harmonic distortion good Same situation exists MC modeRIAA equalization probably best I measuredThat story continues headroom measurementsYou get almost 12 volts output starts clip So pops clicks much less noticeableConclusionsThe PM90 NOT show age It produces average performance compared todays amplifiers It running cool comfortable Not get warm touch go protection Push hard pulls back output keeps going Clearly robust implementation Can compete state art amplification today form Benchmark THX HypexPurifi Class D amps No There real innovation push distortion noise But also lot terrible amplifiers today PM90 easily outperforms much styleThere nothing apologize lot praise Marantz PM90 I hope company goes back roots rather horrible looks performance much AV lineOn class A mode I see reason recommend many reasons avoid If run power certainly create audible distortion Whereas benefit might literally lost noiseI happy recommend Marantz PM90
