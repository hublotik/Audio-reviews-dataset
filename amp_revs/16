0, Pass Laboratories XA25   s I ran it at onethird its clipping power  into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time the top panel was warm at 1023°F  and the heatsink fins were hotter at 1222°F  The gain at the speaker terminals was to spec at 204dB and the output preserved absolute polarity The XA25s unbalanced input impedance was the specified 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping inconsequentially to 34k ohms at the top of the audioband The output impedance  was low at 008 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising very slightly to 01 ohm at 20kHz As a result the variation in frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker was small less than ±01dB  Fig1 shows that the XA25s frequency response is wide with a –3dB point at almost 200kHz The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave therefore has very short risetimes  and there is no overshoot or ringingFig1 Pass Labs XA25 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Pass Labs XA25 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was 90dB in both directions below 3kHz decreasing to 76dB at 20kHz and with its lowerthanusual gain the XA25s unweighted wideband signalnoise ratios were correspondingly superb at 912dB left and 884dB right Both ratios increased to 946dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 973dB when Aweighted Fig3 reveals that the primary source of noise is spuriae at the AC wall frequency of 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics these presumably due to magnetic interference from the power transformerFig3 Pass Labs XA25 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Pass Labs specifies the XA25s output power as 25Wpc into 8 ohms and 50Wpc into 4 ohms  However as you can see in figs 4 and 5 the amplifier exceeded its specified power output at the clipping point which we define as when the THDnoise equals 1 At that THDN percentage the XA25 delivered 80Wpc into 8 ohms  and 130Wpc into 4 ohms  It appears from the shape of the traces in these graphs that Pass specifies the XA25s power as when the THDN is close to 001Fig4 Pass Labs XA25 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Pass Labs XA25 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsAt moderate powers the XA25 offered low levels of distortion but as you can see in fig6 which plots the THDN percentage against frequency at 89V—equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms 20W into 4 ohms and 40W into 2 ohms—the distortion did rise at higher frequencies especially into lower impedances This graph suggests that the XA25 not be used with loudspeakers with an impedance that drops below 4 ohms in the trebleFig6 Pass Labs XA25 THDN  vs frequency at 89V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fortunately the distortion in the midrange was predominantly the relatively innocuous third harmonic  though at low frequencies the second harmonic was equal in level to the third  But note the very low level of all distortion harmonics in this graph Nelson Pass had warned me that measuring the XA25s intermodulation distortion with my usual twintone test signal would be problematic The bias circuit we are using interprets continuous highpower highfrequency tones as a fault If you want to do highpower highfrequency IM test tones you will need to do them quickly or you will get falsely high readings In my spectral analyses I usually average 32 readings to ensure that the distortion products are not obscured by noise for the XA25 I averaged just four readings not turning on the test signal until I was ready to take the reading At a moderate power level into 8 ohms the intermodulation distortion was very low  the IM products all lying close to –90dB ref the peak signal level When I tried to repeat this test into 4 ohms the amplifiers protection circuit kicked in as soon as I turned on the signal generatorFig7 Pass Labs XA25 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms 00027 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Pass Labs XA25 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20W into 4 ohms Fig9 Pass Labs XA25 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms Overall the XA25 performed well on the test bench as Ive come to expect from Pass Labs
