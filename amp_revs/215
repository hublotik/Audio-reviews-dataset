0, Buckeye Hypex NC502MP 8channel class D amplifier  costs US 2295There is not a whole lot to look at here Sheet metal is rather thin and fitment not that great So put it in a cabinet and forget about it The backside shows the expected including trigger control to sequence powering up multiple units with one strokeI was surprised by the weight of the amplifier Mind you it is far lighter than a class AB amplifier but it is still not light The reason for that is that each amplifier module has a large vertical heatsink with quite stout mounting bracket tying it to the chassisIf you are not familiar with Hypex NC502MP it is an allinone high power stereo amplifier with onboard switching power supply and input buffer Supply the connectors and you have a complete amplifier In this case four such modules are included to get to 8 channel Due to large amount of power these amplifiers can produce in tandem dual AC inputs are provided The amplifiers are split between the two AC inputs If you dont need continuous power you can connect both inputs to the same power strip which is how I tested itBuckeye Hypex NC502MP Amplifier MeasurementsLets start with our usual dashboard by measuring one amplifier modules dual outputsPerformance is very good as we expect from Hypex modules A minor issue was the power supply spikes in one channel  I tested all the amplifier modules and they all do the same thing So likely is due to leakage from the onboard power supply bleeding into the more adjacent channel on NC502MP Using the good channel on each board removes that bit of bleedingUsing the former SINAD for ranking the amplifier nicely lands in our excellent bucketHere is all of them in that categoryFrequency response is essentially flat in audible band and changing the load has no impact on outputMultitone shows the superb performance albeit somewhat worsened by the less good channelNoise performance is extremely goodMy target is 96 dB at 5 watts which the Buckeye nicely exceeds And provides full transparency up to reference level of 120 dBSPLCrosstalk naturally is beyond approach if you use two separate modules but even in the same module it is excellentLets measure power into 4 ohm using channels in the same module or two separate onesAs you see there is no difference You are only limited by how much AC power you have as power supplies are not sharedMax and peak power is impressiveWe are talking nearly 13 Kilowatts in stereo Needless to say if you are going to have all 8 channels whaling you better have good amount of current on dual AC lines And make an appointment at your ear nose and throat doctor because hearing damage is most likelyMeasuring response at 8 ohm gave me a really hard timeReason being that online specs from Hypex does not show that hump from 10 to 100 watts at all I tried everything from testing my instrumentation to measuring every amplifier module and still got the same results I shared the graph with Buckeye only to be told there is updated measurements from Hypex showing the same hump  While performance is superb up to about 8 watts I wish that the hump wasnt so pronouncedI was most impressed by the ability of these modules to drive down to 2 ohms with both capacitive and inductive loadsIt produces the same 53 volts no matter what At 1 ohm though it instantly went into protection but recovered very quicklyThis is one powerful and robust amplifierFinally you dont really need to warm it upFYI I left the unit on overnight and in the morning the top was warm especially in the center All the amps combined do generate some amount of heat so best to not leave it on if you dont need it and provide good ventilationConclusionsThe Buckeye NC502MP is a perfect amplifier for home theater duty It provides incredible amount of power from each module to drive even the most inefficient speakers to ear piercing levels It does so with extremely low noise and excellent distortion at modest levels At higher powers distortion does climb While I wish this was lower I dont think there is an issue at all for home theater applications Even with music I think you will be fine but the purist may want to have better Then again if you are going to lose power to get there this amplifier may be a better choiceI am going to put the Buckeye NC502MP 8channel amplifier on my recommended listEDIT teardown now posted always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
