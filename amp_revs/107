0, Mastersound Compact 845 amplifier  The tubes were installed when I received the review sample and I waited for an hour after powering up the amplifier before starting the testing The Mastersound runs hot—after an hour the temperature of the top panel in front of the linestage tubes was 1159°F466°CThe Compact 845 inverted polarity from both the 4 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps with the balanced and singleended inputs but preserved absolute polarity from its Direct inputs which bypass the preamplifier stage and volume control The voltage gain at 1kHz from the unbalanced Direct inputs was 231dB from the 8 ohm tap and 207dB from the 4 ohm tap both figures into 8 ohms From the regular inputs the gain into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm tap with the volume control set to its maximum was 32dB balanced and 3655dB unbalanced The maximum gains from the 4 ohm tap were both 23dB lowerThe input impedance is specified as a high 50k ohms For the singleended Direct input I measured 33k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 286k ohms at 20kHz The normal unbalanced inputs impedance varied from a high 71k ohms at 20Hz to 526k ohms at 20kHz the balanced input impedance was much lower at 3230 ohms across the audiobandFig1 Mastersound 845 Compact 8 ohm output tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 Mastersound 845 Compact 8 ohm output tap smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe source impedance from the 8 ohm output tap was a high 35 ohms at 20Hz 26 ohms at 1kHz and 73 ohms at 20kHz The variation in the smallsignal frequency response with this output with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was therefore moderately high at ±17dB The 4 ohm taps source impedance was lower at 17 ohms at 20Hz 13 ohms at 1kHz and 315 ohms at 20kHz which meant that the response variation with the simulated speaker was lower at ±1dB However there will be audible modifictions of loudspeaker responses with both output taps Into resistive loads  the Mastersound amplifiers 8 ohm output shelved down below 40Hz and rolled off above 10kHz reaching –3dB at 18kHz A sharply defined response peak at 30kHz correlates with overshoot and ringing in the amplifiers reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  This peak was higher in amplitude with higher load impedances and from the 4 ohm output transformer tapFig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum the left channel is 026dB higher in level at 1kHz than the right This difference increased to 046dB when I repeated the measurement with the volume control set to –20dB though the response was otherwise identical        Download audio      Something I noticed while doing these tests was that the Compact 845 emitted audible sounds  which seemed to be coming from the output tube circuitry rather than the transformers While the level wasnt very high—the spl in front of the amplifier was 66dB  slow ballistics with the amplifier driving 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms—it was still readily audible and was not masked by the NPR news playing on a nearby portable radio in the test labThe Compact 845s channel separation  was relatively poor at 50dB in both directions below 1kHz decreasing to 30dB at the top of the audioband I monitored the waveform on an oscilloscope when I performed this measurement which indicated that I was measuring true crosstalk rather than noise The Mastersound amplifiers output had a relatively low level of noise The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  taken from the 8 ohm taps with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was 676dB  This ratio improved slightly to 685dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 789dB when Aweighted With their lower gain the ratios from the 4 ohm outputs were 2dB greaterFig3 Mastersound 845 Compact 8 ohm output tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum  and to –20dB  Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the Mastersounds 8 ohm taps drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum  revealed a low level of random noise However AC supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd and evenorder harmonics were present and their levels didnt change when I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer The highest of these spuriae at 120Hz lay at –73dB  Repeating the analysis with the volume control set to –20dB  lowered the levels of the power supply–related spuriae by up to 6dB but the random noisefloors level didnt changeFig4 Mastersound 845 Compact 8 ohm output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Mastersound 845 Compact 4 ohm output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsMastersound specifies the Compact 845s maximum power as 30W which is equivalent to 1476dBW into 8 ohms and 1176dBW into 4 ohms According to Stereophiles usual definition of clipping when THDN reaches 1 the amplifier didnt get close to that power With both channels driven I measured a clipping power of 115Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms  and 69Wpc from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  Raising the clipping limit to 3 THDN I measured 22Wpc with each output tap matched to the load At 10 THDN the Compact 845 approaches its specified powerFig6 Mastersound 845 Compact 4 ohm output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsTube amplifiers usually have less distortion when the load impedance is greater than the nominal output transformer impedance As revealed in fig6 which plots the THDN percentage against output power with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms the Mastersounds THDN was higher with a larger load impedance not lower At 3 THDN the 4 ohm tap was putting out 10Wpc into 8 ohmsFig7 Mastersound 845 Compact 8 ohm output tap THDN  vs frequency at 49V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig7 shows how the percentage of THDN in both channels varied with frequency with the 8 ohm tap driving 8 and 4 ohms at 49V which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms and 6W into 4 ohms The huge rise in distortion above 10kHz may well be due to the highfrequency rolloff in this region and perhaps to the fact that the distortion is being magnified by the output transformer resonance seen in fig1 The THDN rose slightly at low frequencies and was higher into 4 ohms  than it was into 8 ohms  At the same voltage from the 4 ohm tap  the distortion in the midrange and treble was close to 06 into 4 ohms and 1 into 8 ohmsFig8 Mastersound 845 Compact 8 ohm output

at 3Wpc into 8 ohms Fig10 Mastersound 845 Compact 8 ohm output tap spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 3Wpc into 8 ohms Fortunately as fig8 shows the distortion was predominantly the  second harmonic with higherorder harmonics progressively lower in level  However at low frequencies  the level of the third harmonic was the same as the second perhaps indicating the onset of core saturation in the output transformersFig11 Mastersound 845 Compact 8 ohm output tap HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 3Wpc peak into 8 ohms Due to the masking the level of the second harmonic may not result in audible distortion with music as long as it is not accompanied by intermodulation distortion With the Compact 845s 8 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 3Wpc peak into 8 ohms  the 1kHz difference product lay at –30dB  and many higherorder intermodulation products were present This behavior correlates with the increase in THDN in the top audio octave seen in fig7 The amplifier may well sound better than this test suggests since topoctave energy level is typically lower in music than in test tones However this information is presented here as it is with every review since we standardized on this intermodulation test when we started measuring amplifiers three decades agoOther than the differences caused by different output tubes—the 845 tube is capable of putting out more power than the 300B—these results are very similar to those measured in the Mastersound 300 B SE integrated amplifier which Art Dudley reviewed in March 2008 The high levels of distortion and the high source impedances will be due to the singleended triode topology and the decision not to use loop negative feedback I concluded my discussion of the 300 B SE measurements by asking whether the reviewer liked the amplifier because of what it did right despite what it did wrong or because of what it did wrong In 2008 I didnt have an answer to that question I still dont
