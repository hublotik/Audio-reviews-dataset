Rockville RPA16 Professional power amplifier drop shipped It costs US 390The amp peak spec 10000 watts No typo It weights 40 pounds18 KG meat You probably see bolt holds power transformer top left So switching power supply least Back panel shows nice sub optionThe fan variable speed mostly quiet idle But even modest power spools temps climb making slightly whining soundThe front controls analog actually notched making harder select exact value They sync one notch The displayed amount also couple dB There builtin limiter clipping lightRockville RPA16 MeasurementsLets jump right dashboardThat odd set spikes low frequencies We mains 60 Hz noise also 70 Hz At power level though spray distortion 62 dB sets SINAD though causing rank one worse testedIts score 55 dB low pulled overall median 1 dB 78Signal noise ratio poor 5 watts likely due power supply noise But much power push ratio badMultitone test shows distortion naturally gets worse higher frequenciesFrequency response nice load independent indicating nonswitching amplifierYou choice two roll offs sub output Strangely boost gain wellLets see accurate power specs Naturally dont get one powerful amplifier generating nearly 1500 watts channels combinedLetting distortion go shorter term signal get even itI dont think measured much power weEven 8 ohm ton powerAs noted though noise floor high I think worst measured Distortion actually doesnt set 100 wattsChecking frequency vs power distortion see orderly responseIf using sub want use number rather 1 kHz power tests shown earlier Fortunately still ton power considering dual channels drivenFinally I ran wideband spectrum test confirm design switchingAnd There also good filtering push noise levels low hundred kilohertz ConclusionsThis interesting take pro amplifier go nonswitching design This makes amp extremely heavy compared competition yet price maintained absurdly low Copious amount power available tolerate fan noiseDue high level noise I cant recommend Rockville RPA16 But welcome choose otherwise based factors
