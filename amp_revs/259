0, Linn AV5125 5channel amplifier It was kindly sent to me by a member It is out of production but originally cost US 2999 I only see one used one on ebay for 2100 which seems pretty expensive for an old amp Then again Linn is a highend audio company so maybe it holds its valueEDIT member feedback shows prices are really in US 600 range for used unitsDespite the high channel count the AV5125 is quite light and smallThe back of the unit shows the unusual BFA  speaker connectorsI had to rebuild my test harness to test it which I was none too happy about it It basically a banana plug but hollow on the insideThe trick to light weight is a switching power supply and a set of fans to cool the heatsinksA pair of integrated IC amps are used for each channel The heatsink is beefy despite its reduced height In use the fans never came on I am suspecting some kind of rail switching is used to keep power consumption lowOverall it is a cute design if you have to ask me Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with a simple 1 kHz tone driving the amplifier to 5 watts with 4 ohm loadSINAD which is a combined metric of noise and distortion is above average of 90 amplifiers tested in all formsCrosstalk is not very goodFrequency response is also not flat which is surprisingDynamic range though is very good especially near full powerAs noted though when I ran the full power test momentarily it started to scream quite loud How loud you say Well my wife who was downstairs listening to her podcast using headphones heard it and asked are you making that beeping sound So there we also have wife stories in our testsPower test produced an unusual curveAs you see in the two reference amplifier tests in dashed lines usually the graph points down due to noise contributions lowering as power goes up Not here The curve is flat which indicates constant distortion That is not a bad thing per se as we see really good performance until we exceed 20 watts and then we get ordinary responseSame repeats with 8 ohm loadHere at low power we have very clean outputBack to 4 ohm load we can see how much more power we get if we relax distortion to 1 and also measuring momentary powerThe news is not good as is typical in amplifiers with switching power supplies which run regulated For good or bad you get maximum power they have in all conditions Typical class AB amplifier has unregulated power supply rails which due to a capacitor bank can produce more power in short durationConclusionsThis is an unusual design from a highend company which went after home theater market back in the day when they could  The guts is not highend but seems custom and well thought out Performance is reasonable to good I tend to like the originality small size light weight and proper engineering from this Scottish companyIf you can find one on the cheap  then it is worth looking at the Linn AV5125 I am going to recommend it more from emotional point of view than logic
