Sunfire Cinema Grand five channel power amp designed Bob Carver member In 1996 cost US 2375 This unit 1999 caps upgradedI cant say I fan look The meter shows obscure measurement power supply joules The dial never moves uselessBack panel shows deviations norm wellIn addition normal speaker terminals front channels also current output This means 1 ohm resistor series output This causes voltagepower loss inversely proportional impedance speaker As varies frequency response speaker different tonalityThere balanced XLR input I used testingThis amplifier third iteration Bob Carver After leaving Phase Linear designed Magnetic Field amplifier Carver name That product varies AC duty cycle way change incoming AC voltage output DC This lowers losses output transistors since dont operate worst case See review Carver M15t amplifier Bob left started Sunfire came amplifier design Instead crudely changing AC duty cycle amplifier DC DC converter tracks incoming music The higher input level increase output voltage thereby keeping output transistors optimal voltage level Result high efficiency compared normal class AB design Lets measure see well worksBTW two versions one 200 watts one 400 watts Maybe I going blind I could see designation unit Carver Cinema Grand Amplifier MeasurementsAs M15t I noticed lot noise I fed unit signal lets look thatWe see dc dc converter pass lot AC noise harmonics This impacts performance unitWhile second harmonic distortion dominates 72 dB mains noise far behind causing SINAD drop 67 dB This ranks pretty close bottom amplifiers testedSNR good result noiseMultitone 5 watts suffers power supply spikes high intermodulation distortionCrosstalk surprisingly poorThere seems inductive leakage frequencies 5 kHz I guessing bleed shared power DC DC converterOddest thing frequency responseThere verbiage Bob Carver voicing amplifier Perhaps intentional one channel different otherClaim fame high power capability lets see delivers thatIt indeed At expense noise distortion still 37 pound amplifier time 5 channels less would position produce powerThe new DC DC converter regulated headroom powerThere healthy power 8 ohm wellI lower input level substantially get amp run frequency dependence would pull back severely higher frequenciesThe lines high vertical scale indicating high noise distortion already know What seen difficulty amp high frequencies This likely due dc dc converter able track voltage higher frequencies Fortunately music naturally far lower level higher frequencies actual impact lowFinally amplifier stable power onScale heavily exaggerated one channel improving 1 dB And stable startConclusionsBob seems gotten high order bit right figuring produce high efficiency high power amplifier Alas much talk fidelity department poor showing Mains noise gets readily distortion quite high even 1996 standards From buying used point view cool running environment amp means ages well risks lower Then dc dc converter brings lot complexity designOverall Carver Cinema Grand something I would recommend But I see people purchasing lightweight multichannel amplifier delivers lot power To extent purchase lot less modern class D amps would decent buyPS I dont carver amps test Nor I seek They happen become available around time
