0,  Sunfire Cinema Grand five channel power amp designed by Bob Carver  a member In 1996 it cost US 2375 This unit is from 1999 and has had its caps upgradedI cant say I am a fan of this look The meter shows an obscure measurement of the power supply joules The dial never moves so it is uselessBack panel shows some deviations from norm as wellIn addition to normal speaker terminals the front channels also have current output This just means that there is a 1 ohm resistor in series with the output This causes voltagepower loss that is inversely proportional to the impedance of the speaker As such it varies the frequency response of the speaker so can have different tonalityThere is balanced XLR input which is what I used for my testingThis amplifier is the third iteration of Bob Carver After leaving Phase Linear he designed the Magnetic Field amplifier under the Carver name That product varies the AC duty cycle as a way to change the incoming AC voltage and with it the output DC This lowers the losses in the output transistors since they dont have to operate for worst case  See my review of Carver M15t amplifier Bob then left and started Sunfire and with it came this amplifier design Instead of crudely changing the AC duty cycle this amplifier has a DC to DC converter which tracks the incoming music The higher the input level the more it will increase its output voltage thereby keeping the output transistors in their optimal voltage level Result again is very high efficiency compared to normal class AB design Lets measure it to see how well it worksBTW there are two versions of this one at 200 watts and one at 400 watts Maybe I am going blind but I could not see any designation of such on the unit Carver Cinema Grand Amplifier MeasurementsAs with the M15t I noticed a lot of noise before I fed the unit a signal so lets look at thatWe see that the dc to dc converter is pass through a lot of AC noise and harmonics This impacts the performance of the unitWhile second harmonic distortion dominates at 72 dB the mains noise is not far behind causing SINAD  to drop further to just 67 dB This is ranks pretty close to the bottom of all the amplifiers testedSNR is not good as a result of that noiseMultitone at 5 watts suffers from both power supply spikes and high intermodulation distortionCrosstalk is surprisingly poorThere seems to be inductive leakage at frequencies below 5 kHz which I am guessing is bleed through the shared power DC to DC converterOddest thing was the frequency responseThere is some verbiage from Bob Carver about voicing the amplifier Perhaps this is intentional but then why is one channel different than the otherClaim to fame here is high power capability so lets see if it delivers on thatIt does indeed At the expense of noise and distortion but still a 37 pound amplifier of the time with 5 channels no less would be in no position to produce such a powerThe new DC to DC converter is regulated so no headroom powerThere is healthy power at 8 ohm as wellI had to lower the input level substantially to get the amp to run the frequency dependence as it would pull back severely at higher frequenciesThe lines are very high in vertical scale indicating high noise and distortion which we already know about What we had not seen is the difficulty the amp has with high frequencies This is likely due to the dc to dc converter not being able to track the voltage at higher frequencies Fortunately music naturally has far lower level at higher frequencies so actual impact is lowFinally the amplifier is stable from power onScale is heavily exaggerated with the one channel improving just 1 dB And the other being stable from startConclusionsBob seems to have gotten the high order bit right in figuring out how to produce a high efficiency high power amplifier Alas much of the talk is about fidelity and in that department this is a poor showing Mains noise gets through readily and distortion is quite high even by 1996 standards From buying used point of view the cool running environment of this amp means that it ages very well so the risks are lower Then again that dc to dc converter brings a lot more complexity to the designOverall the Carver Cinema Grand is not something I would recommend But I can see people purchasing it as a lightweight multichannel amplifier that delivers a lot of power To the extent you can purchase it for a lot less than modern class D amps it would be a decent buyPS no I dont have any more carver amps to test  Nor did I seek them out They just happen to become available all around the same time
