Usually I measure amplification digital product I carry box stairs basement I listening room test lab However Accustic Arts AMP V heavy Instead I rolled wheeled flightcase vestibule outside listening room removed flightcase cover left amplifier sitting flightcase top small flight stairs I set system dedicated PC analog digital oscilloscopes test loads etc foot stairs The amplifiers two AC leads plugged closest wall socket along test system Before I performed testing amplifier running oneeighth specified power 8 ohms 30 minutes recommended CEA After preconditioning heatsinks amplifiers sides hot 1134°F The top panel warm 1050°F Soon I began testing—after preconditioning period—the 15A circuit breaker serving wall socket everything plugged tripped I therefore ran two long extension cords 20A wall sockets test lab one amplifier test gear started I left offThe AMP Vs specified voltage gain 30dB I measured 309dB 8 ohms balanced inputs 3075dB singleended inputs All inputs outputs preserved absolute polarity ie noninverting The input impedance lower specified values 10k ohms balanced across audioband rather specified 32k ohms unbalanced input impedance 67k ohms compared specified 15k ohms Still values high enough compatibility problems unlikely With Damping Factor correction switched output impedance low 014 ohm 20Hz 20kHz Turning Damping Factor increased output

THDN varied frequency 20V amplifier turned 10 seconds driving 2 ohms level I assumed would due protection circuitry job however I removed power cables let amplifier cool plugged back wouldnt turn Each two AC power sockets two fuses four okay The AMP V also internal fuses must gone opencircuit I removed 10 bolts hold top panel place I wasnt able remove I tried everything I could think present
