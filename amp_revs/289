0, PS Audio Sprout100 integrated DAC headphone and power amplifier The Sprout100 is an upgrade over the original Sprout and costs USD 599I remember the first time I saw the Sprout at an audio show I thought it was utterly cute It is small and handsome little package with a ton of functionalityAs you see in addition to functions I mentioned it even has Bluetooth included And moving magnet turntable input It is a dream product for a frustrated marketing guy in a highend audio company like PS Audio wanting mass market product that appeals to the younger audience The volume control is a rotary encoder with a builtin switch that powers the unit on and off If you hold the button down the LED color changes from purple to white indicating bass boost is on The rotary encoder is poorly programmed to have linear and slow response making it very very slow to change volume To go from low to high volume you may have to turn it seven or eight times We live in a digital age with music that is fast to access and comes at all levels Having the ability to quickly change volume is importantInput selection is old school mechanical selector I like the clear labelsThe backside shows how much is crammed in thereI did not test sub out but it has sensor that automatically activates that output In addition to USB input we also have toslink optical which is nice in case of ground loopsThe nicest bit is included power supply in such a small package Kudos for managing to fit that in there and reduce clutterThere is protection circuit for both power amplifier and headphone During testing I found it to frequently activate which simply turns off the unit It caused a lot of head scratching until I discovered the latter actionIt is also I think underdesigned from cooling perspective When I started my DAC testing I had the dummy load connected to the unit as well After a few minutes of testing I noticed the signal went away Then I realized per above it had shut down Went to touch the power button and it was hot as heck As was the rest of the enclosure which was super hot Even the top wood panel was hot to touch  I would not rely on the 100 watt rating into 4 ohm to be a continuous rating for any length of timeThe Sprout100 is rated at 100 watts into 4 ohm and according to PS Audio uses ICEPower modulesI should tell you that I hate testing multifunction devices like this  Every subsystem takes as much time as reviewing another product with just that functionality In the interest of getting the review done I did not bother to test the Vinyl input I also did not touch the sub out or toslinkDAC MeasurementsThe inclusion of line out allows us to test the DAC subsystem independently so lets start with our dashboard thereThe output was variable so I adjusted it to 2 volt Per my review notes above the power amplifier was on and was whaling away into the dummy load at the same timePS Audio rates Sprout100 as having less than 001 THDN distortion from line out We are beating that although that is such a low bar Equivalent rating in SINAD  puts the Sprout100 in our bottom quarter of DACs reviewedNot a good place to be although probably fits the performance target they created for themselves for lifestyle product like thisBack to our THDN rating we can separate the components of distortion and noise and get this ratioThey are both contributing to the final THDN but the noise is a bit more dominant Likely in this small enclosure the could not get enough isolation for the DAC subsystem to reduce noise levelsThe high noise level makes the jitter graph pretty with almost no spikes visible but that is because the noise floor is so elevatedBest in class DACs put that noise floor down to the bottom of the graphSame noise problem manifests itself hugely in linearity testThat smooth exponential rise indicates random noise polluting the voltage reading at each level Noisefree performance then stops around 80 dB or 13 bits  quit a bit shy of 16 bit performance of CD In this day and age I like any DAC to at least do justice to CD format bringing fully transparency to 96 dBIntermodulation test shows similar higher noise floor but also pretty early rising of distortion levelsSimilar story for THDN versus frequencyDynamic range of the DAC is as specdSpeaker Amplifier MeasurementsNote all amplifier testing except when noted is with an AUX0040 Audio Precision filter in place to reduce high frequency components given the fact that this is a switching amplifier designAs usual for amplifiers I test with 5 watt output The trick is to know what to use for input level and volume control With digital input that was easy as I set the level to 0 dBFS But then I thought we want to know the performance of the amp alone so we better test with analog input and here is what I gotWith digital input I could get over 80 dB by the way But no combination of input and volume level could get us there with analog input In some sense then the amplifier is good enough for the performance of the DACFrequency response showed different response in each channelI swapped my loads and the curve did not change indicating that the variation is due to the amplifier  design not differences in my loads Clearly the channel in blue is resonating around 50 kHz causing that large boost of nearly 20 dB What you get with your speaker load and its wiring is unknown The red channel is more behaved We saw the same discrepancy between channels in the SINAD in the dashboardPoking our noise into the design using highbandwidth spectrum  analysis we see thisNote that this is a raw test with the external filter removed We clearly see the switching frequency around 600 kHz peaking up to almost 20 dB You can have your own AM station if you like  We have an early rise in noise before 100 kHz which is due to some kind of noise shaping There are a lot of other spikes which one could examine to see what is going on but I am too lazy to do so Regardless these amplifiers are not pretty to look at as far as performance above audible band It is the price you pay for having 100 wattchannel amplifier squeezed into a little boxSpeaking of power lets measure that into 4 ohm loadWe get 82 watts with both channels driven which is shy of the 100 watt specification Noise and distortion is lower than Topping TP60  amplifier And there is more powerSignal to noise ratio is OKHeadphone Amplifier MeasurementsLets jump right in with power versus distortion and noise at 300 ohmsWe have competent level of power but much more noise and distortion than our reference Topping DX3 Pro  I like to see at least 100 milliwatts here and the Sprout100 deliversHere is the picture at 33 ohmWe have 420 milliwatts of power until the Sprout100 shuts down causing the graph to shoot back to the left In other words the unit is distortionless until it shuts downOutput impedance is a bit high at 57 ohmsHeadphone Listening TestI started my testing with Sennheiser HD650 There was enough power there for a very good experience I could not detect any onset of distortionSwitching to Hifiman HE400i I got a bit more power and again clarity and power until the endDedicated headphone amplifiers will produce more power but there was enough here with either headphone to give a bit of tingling to my ear lobes during bass so I was happy I could not get the Sprout100 to shut down with the HE400i so in practice this may not be a serious problemConclusionThe reviews I read prior to testing the Sprout100 all point to how great it is that a highend company like PS Audio has produced such a mass market product And that this association must be translating into excellent sound Our objective measurements show that this is not the case Performance of such subsystem as the DAC and headphone amplifier is nothing to write home about Subjective aspects though are good lots of power from the headphone amp and to some extent from the power amplifierThe miss from usability is the super slow to change volume control In many cases I could move it a notch and nothing would happen to the output in my analyzer let alone the earsSo where do we land From objective performance I cant say that the Sprout100 lives up to the promise of the brand From full functionality point of view at 599 it seems to be there though although I have yet to test many products in this category For this reason I am going to withhold giving or holding back a recommendation Let the data guide you in that regard
