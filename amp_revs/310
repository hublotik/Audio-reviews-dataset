0, Sabaj A1 desktop  amplifier It was kindly sent to me by a member Not sure if it is still in production but you can still find it for 60 or so Main interest in testing this unit is the use of the TPA3118 class D amplifier which is used in all kinds of other devices including Genelec 8030c powered monitorFor the price the enclosure is not half badA little LED display shows the active input  and current volume level As is typical a laptop sized power supply provides the juiceThe unit runs cool If you overtax it it will reset and power back on at low output levelSabaj A1 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt dashboardAs you see I set the gain to 29 dB which is the standard I use for integrated amplifiers Resulting SINAD is dominated by distortion and is well below average for all amps testedBut if you compare it to other low cost amps in this price bracket performance is a good 10 dB betterNoise performance is in the same classFrequency response is not flat but good to see it rolling off as opposed to peakingCrosstalk is what you expect in this type of deviceMost important is power and this is how the A1 did into 4 ohmNot a whole lot of power I am afraid Pushing it harder didnt do any good eitherThe power supply runs out of juice and the device shuts down May do better with a more powerful power supply Here it is into 8 ohmConclusionsAs a class I expect these cheap amps to be broken The A1 is not that bad My concern is too little power Many small speakers are inefficient and you need more than 20 watts to get decent performance out of them My suggestion is to save on spending money on food and flowers and save up for a better amp But if you cant the Sabaj A1 may do the job for youAs it is I cant recommend the Sabaj A1 I am too much of an audiotechnology snob to go for it
