0, Behringer A800 Class D Stereo Amplifier The A800 costs US 299 including free shipping from multiple sitesThe member who loaned it me has done a youtube video of it which you can see by clicking on this linkBehringer has been in this game for a long time and it shows from high level of optimization of weight size and robustness of the A800The unit is quite shallow relative to its width Standard gain controls are provided which go up to 30 dB  Nice set of LEDs show the output level including clipping indicators All amplifiers should come with such displays  I could do without the notches in the volume control though as they are fake  and made exact setting harder  Not a big deal thoughBack panel shows nice set of connectivityFor my testing I focused on XLR input only and standard speaker banana connectorsThe amp hardly radiates any heat and has no fan Given the pro application of these amps I expect them to be robust and reliableDuring measurements the A800 provides high level of predictability and assuredness that I sometimes miss when testing switching amplifiers It only shut down once after fair bit of experimentation at full powerAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a gain of 29 dB to deliver 5 watts into 4 ohm loadThis performance is very close to the Behringer A500 which I reviewed before  That amp though generated much worse SINAD because of its nonswitching power supplyIts distortion products are capped to 80 dB which is what we see in A800  Eliminating those power supply components sharply improves SINAD which is relative to sum of noise and distortionSignal to noise ratio is OKDont use it on sensitive speakers you may hear some hiss 32tone test signal resembling music shows early rise in distortion with frequencyCrosstalk is reasonableDual 1920 kHz tone shows very high level of intermodulation distortion as we saw in multitone testFortunately your music doesnt have such high amplitude tones and threshold of hearing is high that I dont think this is nearly as much of a problem for the ear as it is for the eyeFrequency Response MeasurementsThe necessary low pass filter is causing some peaking at 20 kHz to the tune of 05 dBThe above is with a resistive load I have been asked frequently how the amp performs with a real speaker Stereophile uses a simulated load of a 2way speaker that was given to them by NHT I built a similar load based on schematic from Doug SelfHere is the impedance of my load versus frequencyMy response is more damped in low frequency than what Doug Self and Stereophile show I will investigate this further but for now it is close enough Here is the phase responseAnd Stereophile graph of the twoUsing my simulated load this is what I get with A800 amplifierAs you see there is hardly any difference Looking at stereophile graphs they use highly zoomed version to show differences This is what happens when I do the sameSo a bit of ringing becomes apparent but it is so small as to not be of any consequence Heaven knows your speakers are not anywhere close to this level of variationI will test some of the other amplifiers I have with this load and see if it causes more variation As it is resistive load is the same as complex oneNote that neither my load nor stereophiles are high power ones So I cannot plot full power graphs and such Above measurements were at 5 wattsAmplifier Power MeasurementsGoing back to our resistive load we get this output with 4 ohmsThe show starts well with A800 being much quieter than our premium brand NAD AVR But then distortion kicks in and we dont do as well We get however tons of power nearly a quarter of a kilowatt Similar story holds for 8 ohm loadStill that is a lot of power at 8 ohm leaving our AVR way back in the dustUsing 1 threshold for THDN we get more power naturally than my graphs above indicateLeft hand is shortterm burst power right side is long termThermal StabilityPerformance improved just a bit after 10 minutes of warm up at 5 wattsSo you dont have to leave it on for good performanceConclusionsThe Behringer A800 does what pro amps try to do provide solid middleoftheroad distortion and noise with tons of power in quiet and light package for little money The design is stable and better than the A500 As such I can recommend the A800 as an everyday amplifier
