0, Parasound Zamp V3 stereo power amplifier The version I have is a revision or two older than what Parasound builds  The latest version is being sold on Amazon for US 277 including Prime shipping Considering this is a brand name company and we have a class AB amplifier this seems like a reasonable priceThe Zamp V3 comes in a tiny and rather cute halfrack packageIn addition to power button you also have a headphone jack From the bit I have read the output is just the amplifier with a resistor inline This means its output impedance is high  and likely noisy as well I did not test itThe back panel exposes good bit of control not seen on normal hifi amplifiersParasound has a leg in two industries the Custom Integration  channel and hifi The former is for companies who install these amplifiers in hideaway places to for example power a couple of speakers for a bedroom TV The gain controls and such give flexibility to this kind of installation as does the small form factor Crosstalk was poor matching a 25 amplifier I testedFrequency response is OKNoise performance as you can predict from the dashboard is not fantasticAmplifier Power MeasurementsLets get into the most important bit which is power capability starting with 4 and going into 8 ohmsWeird how one channel goes crazy at just 1 to 2 watt Specs are matched thoughAllowing for higher distortion of 1 doesnt help with max power but does give us more burst powerThermal StabilityHere is the test that resulted in the shutdownI was messing with grounding and caused that little blip so ignore thatConclusionsI really like the cute and small form factor of this amp for desktop use Alas with a weak thermal management it wont produce much volume before shutting down Used ones have probably had a hard life due to this reason as well If you are going to play with one and want to shy away from the million switching amplifiers out there in this price range go ahead But I cant recommend the unit
