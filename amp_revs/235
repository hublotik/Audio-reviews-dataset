0, Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier  costs US 8999 with stock 32 volt supply Price goes up to 10999 with the 48 volt supply There is a 10 discount coupon right nowDespite its budget price the V3 manages to look elegant with the hole pattern on top and large and smooth feeling VolumeOnOff control Power supply is external and as noted you get a choiceAs you will see later you really want the 48 volt versionYes it is a larger supply but you are going to hide it behind your desk anyway so might as well live the good life with the increased power there The amplifier is based on TI TPA3255 class D amplifier IC There are replaceable opamps for those of you who have nothing better to do than mess with the designWhen I took the amplifier out of the package I noticed something rattling in there Fearing the worst I took the unit apart Turns out one of the two large power supply caps had lost its adhesion to the PCB The putty used is to keep the cap glued to the PCB was too flexible and had broken loose No harm though as the cap is laying on its side and cant go anywhere The sound I was hearing was it moving just a hair up and down and hitting the top of the case Suggest company use a different material to fix thisI will post the pictures of the insides later For now a large aluminum couples the amplifier IC to the case There is no thermal grease but the amp ran cool enough that I dont think you need to worry about it But if you are this you can remedy yourself Despite me pushing the amp to max power repeatedly it just got warm to touch The protection circuit was the best kind with high tolerance of clipping and audiorestartFosi Audio V3 Amplifier MeasurementsI performed the low power tests using the 32 volt supply The rest is done with both So lets start with our usual dashboardDistortion is nicely kept to 100 dB so we are noise limited causing SINAD to land around 88 dB This is well above average for all amplifiers testedNotice how many amplifiers it beats to the right of itNoise performance is also quite good for the class almost clearing the hurdle for 16 bit content at just 5 wattsFrequency response shows load dependency which all class D amplifiers in this price range showIn English this means that depending on which speaker you use the sound may be a bit bright or a bit dull if your hearing extends to 20 kHz You can counter with EQ Multitone and 1920 kHz show good performance for the classEdit forgot to post crosstalk measurementLets see how much power we can get out of this little box into 4 ohmYou normally wouldnt expect to get more power with a 48 volt supply compared to 32 volt when their current ratings are the same But as I noted in the picture at the start the larger power supply is conservatively rated and is able to pump out more current for peaks We can see this in our shortterm power measurementsWith 8 ohm volt we are more in need of voltage so naturally we get tons more there as well with the 48 volt supplyTransfer function is quite good for class D and I was especially impressed with its ability to pump out same power at high frequencies as many amplifiers go into protection thereThere is some pop noise when turning on and off but it is very mildThe amplifier is stable on power upSome of you have been aiming at creating more work for me by asking for for efficiency tests I developed a test that is semiautomatic and provides reasonable accuracy Note that part of the heat is dissipated in the power supply and part in the amp The X axis is power per channel not total Edit here are the teardown picturesConclusionsState of the art DACs run on highly performant silicon that when well implemented produces the best performance we have seen We are seeing similar development with these class D IC amplifiers Noise and distortion is quite low and beats many amplifiers in the market They bring two drawbacks external power supplies and load dependencies If the latter is resolved these amplifiers would obsolete large segment of the audio marketThe Fosi Audio V3 is well implemented and brings nice looks and design at a bargain price Company is also quite receptive to customer input and is a delight to work with behind the scenes I dont know what else we could ask forI am going to recommend the Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifierEDIT a few pages in the thread claim was made that the input buffer opamp must be fake as they dont look like the official TI chip packaging Company chimed in a couple of days later saying they bought the ICs directly from TI And showed the purchase order proving the same It seems the internet got this wrong as far as what constitutes a fake as TI is using two different factories with different packaging
