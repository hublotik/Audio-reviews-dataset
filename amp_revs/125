0, Exposure 3010S using Audio Precisions topmodel SYS2722 system  for most of the tests with some use made of the older AP System One As usual  amplifier by running both channels at onethird power into 8 ohms which maximally stresses an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage The normal preconditioning period is one hour but the Exposure turned itself off after just 20 minutes While the chassis was warm the area of the top cover above the internal heatsink was almost too hot to keep my hand on After the amplifier had cooled down I turned it on again and all seemed well But this does suggest that the Exposures heatsinking is inadequate for sustained use at levels around 40Wpc which could well happen if the amplifier is used to provide music at a partyThe maximum voltage gain at the 3010Ss speaker output jacks was 4115dB into 8 ohms which is typical for an integrated amplifier As the 3010S also has preamplifier output jacks I could measure the maximum gain at these it was 1725dB which implies a poweramplifier gain of 239dB The preamplifier outputs were noninverting and had a source impedance of 48 ohms at high and middle frequencies rising to 410 ohms in the low bass The amplifier as a whole and the phono stage also preserved absolute polarityThe input impedance of the linestage jacks was moderately high at 21k ohms at low frequencies dropping slightly to 18k ohms at the top of the audioband The phonostage input impedance was fixed at 47k ohms at 20Hz dropping slightly to 456k ohms at 1kHz and 37k ohms at 20kHz Measured at the tape output jacks the phono stage had a gain of 406dB which is appropriate for use with movingmagnet phono cartridges or movingcoils with a stepup transformer which was how AD auditioned the unit The phono sections signalnoise ratio  was good at 686dB and the overload margin again ref 5mV at 1kHz was superb across the audioband at 26dB or greater The only disappointing aspect of the Exposures phono stage was its unflat RIAA correction  which showed a 1–15dB boost in the midrange I suspect that it is this error that gave rise to ADs feeling that the 3010S sounded overly dark overly heavy via its phono inputFig1 Exposure 3010S phonostage RIAA error The Exposures output impedance at the speaker jacks was a low 01 ohm across the audioband As a result the modification of its frequency response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker  remained within ±01dB limits  Channel matching was excellent The amplifier starts to roll off at the top of the audioband with the response at 20kHz down by 075dB which is inconsequential though it does slow a little the leading edges of a 10kHz squarewave  The 1kHz squarewave response  was perfect with flat tops confirming the excellent lowfrequency extension seen in fig2 Channel separation via the line stage  was very good at 90dB R–L and 80dB L–R below 2kHzFig2 Exposure 3010S frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig3 Exposure 3010S smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe SN ratio for the line input measured with the input shorted but the volume control wide open was 73dB ref 1V  this improving slightly to 786dB when Aweighted Claimed to deliver 110Wpc into 8 ohms  the Exposure easily exceeded that maximum power rating with 140Wpc  available at clipping into that load  The maximum power into 4 ohms was 200Wpc  again with both channels driven Fig4 shows how the THDN percentage present in the amplifiers output varies with power into 8 and 4 ohms the shape of the traces in this graph indicates that below a few tens of watts the distortion present is actually below the amplifiers noise floor with this 1kHz signalFig4 Exposure 3010S distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 ohmsI therefore measured how the amplifiers THDN varied with frequency and load impedance at a fairly high output level of 10V The results are shown in fig5 both channels show a rise in THD in the treble but the left channel was less linear than the right For example the right channel was more linear into 4 ohms  than the left channel into 8 ohms  Similarly the right channel into 2 ohms  was more linear than the left into 4  I have no way of knowing whether this channel mismatch is due to a lapse in quality control or to a problem in design circuit layout or component selection but fortunately the spectral content of the distortion is heavily loworder in nature  Fig7 was taken 6dB below clipping into 4 ohms the amplifier is definitely working hard under these conditions as revealed by the presence of powersupply components at 120 and 240Hz Despite its use of a massive toroidal power transformer which coupled hum into Arts movingcoil stepup transformer the 3010Ss output is commendably free of magnetically induced spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics The internal shielding worksFig5 Exposure 3010S THDN  vs frequency at 1315V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig6 Exposure 3010S 1kHz waveform at 233W into 4 ohms  00111 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig7 Exposure 3010S spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Finally with the left channels reduced linearity at high frequencies it was not surprising that it performed less well than the right channel on the demanding highpower highfrequency intermodulation test  The 1kHz difference component reached an okay –80dB in the left channel  but an excellent –97dB in the right Fig8 Exposure 3010S HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 120W peak into 4 ohms Other than the unflat RIAA equalization and the difference in channel linearity the Exposure 3010Ss measured performance was excellent
