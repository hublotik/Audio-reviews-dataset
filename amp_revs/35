0, of the Bryston 3BST using its unbalanced inputs with selected measurements repeated in the balanced mode as noted belowFollowing its 13power onehour preconditioning test the 3BSTs heatsinks were very hot though not outside the normal range of temperatures usually encountered in this test The 3BST is noninverting when driven from its positive unbalanced input at the balanced XLR input terminal pin 2 is positive as specified DC offset measured 55mV in the left channel 41mV in the rightThe Bryston 3BSTs input impedance measured 497k ohms  The output impedance measured under 003 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing to a maximum of 009 ohms at 20kHz Voltage gain measured 292dB  The unweighted signalnoise  measured 92dB over a 22Hz22kHz bandwidth 83dB over a 10Hz500kHz bandwidth The Aweighted figure was 95dB The corresponding figures for balanced drive were all just under 1dB worse  in all casesFig1 shows the smallsignal frequency response of the 3BST  There is little worthy of comment here The same is true of the 10kHz squarewave response  which is virtually textbook with good risetime and no overshoot or ringing Fig1 Bryston 3BST frequency response at  2W into 4 ohms 1W into 8 ohms and 283V into simulated speaker load Fig2 Bryston 3BST smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 shows the 3BSTs crosstalk The difference between the two channels should be of no audible consequence at such high absolute separation levelsFig3 Bryston 3BST crosstalk  LR RL The manner in which the Brystons THDnoise varies with frequency is shown in fig4 The THD of the Bryston is so low that I used 10 times our normal output power for this measurement to get results which were not obscured by noise Note that for the simulated real load I measured at an output of 89V—a small change from our recent practice Fig4 Bryston 3BST THDnoise vs frequency at  40W into 2 ohms 20W into 4 ohms 89V into simulated speaker load and 10W into 8 ohms Fig5 compares the THDnoise in unbalanced and balanced modes note that the unbalanced is lower—though both are very lowFig5 Bryston 3BST THDnoise vs frequency at  10W into 8 ohms balanced and 10W into 8 ohms unbalanced The waveform of the distortion at 25W into 2 ohms is shown in fig6 It is heavily third harmonic with some noise The waveforms  into 4 and 8 ohm were similar though with higher powers required to get a significant reading above the low levels of noiseFig6 Bryston 3BST 1kHz waveform at 25W into 2 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out The 3BSTs output spectrum reproducing 50Hz at 154W into 4 ohms is shown in fig7 The distortion products are all extremely low in level—below 90dB or 0003 At an output of 312V into our simulated real load  I obtained the result shown in fig8 Only the third harmonic  is in any way relevant though other artifacts at less than 80dB are visibleFig7 Bryston 3BST spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz at 154W into 4 ohms Fig8 Bryston 3BST spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz at 312V into simulated loudspeaker load  Note that the third harmonic is the highest in level at 70dB Figs9  10 shows the output spectrum resulting from the amplifier driving a combined 1920kHz signal at 705W into 8 ohms and 117W into 4 ohms respectively  While clearly more IM products were produced into the 4 ohm load in all cases the artifacts are very low in level—below 80dB Fig9 Bryston 3BST HF intermodulation spectrum DC22kHz 1920kHz at 705W into 8 ohms Fig10 Bryston 3BST HF intermodulation spectrum DC22kHz 1920kHz at 117W into 4 ohms The way in which the 3BSTs THDnoise varies with output power  is shown in fig11 The discrete clipping levels for the 3BST are shown in Table 1 Into 8 ohms bridged the 3BST reached clipping  at 453W  Note that the 3BSTs power supply is starting to give up into a 2 ohm load It will drive the load but at considerably reduced powerFig11 Bryston 3BST distortion  vs output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms and 2 ohmsThe Bryston 3BST produced a solid set of measurements especially notable for its low distortion noise and crosstalk I would not choose this amplifier to drive a loudspeaker which hovered around 2 ohms for most of the audible range but fortunately such loudspeakers are rare—Thomas J NortonFootnote 1 Why 312V As is noted above the impedance of the simulated load varies across the frequency range making interpretation of the result difficult if we relate the output to power I therefore measured the voltage at which the amplifier clipped at 1kHz into the simulated real load  38V in this case and took the measurement at 82 of this Why 82 Because we normally take the reading at 67 of rated power and power is proportional to the square of the voltage—082 squared is 067—Thomas J Norton
