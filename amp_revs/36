0, Moon Evolution 860A    As the amplifier is specified as having a maximum power output of 200Wpc into 8 ohms I preconditioned it before the measurements by running it at onethird that power 67W into 8 ohms for an hour Following that period the heatsinks were warm at 1102°F  The THDnoise percentage at this power level was 00126 with the amplifier cold 00115 with it fully warmThe voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was higher than the norm at 313dB with both balanced and unbalanced input signals and the 860A preserved absolute polarity  for both inputs  The unbalanced input impedance was to specification at 463k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping slightly to 34k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedances were twice these values as expected The output impedance including 6 of speaker cable was very low at 009 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 011 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the variation in response due to the interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0075dB The frequency response was perfectly flat in the audioband and down by 3dB at 120kHz into 8 ohms  As a result the Moon amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was essentially perfect with no overshoot or ringing  Channel separation  was 100dB in both directions at and below 1kHz and was still 80dB L–R and 87dB R–L at 20kHz Though some spuriae were present in the 860As output at the mains frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics  these were all at or below –130dB ref 283V into 8 ohms The wide unweighted signalnoise ratio with the input shorted to ground was 857dB  improving to 927dB with the measurement bandwidth restricted to the audioband and to 951dB when Aweighted Despite its higherthanusual gain the 860A is a quiet amplifierFig1 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms left hannel blue right red and at 100W into 8 ohms Figs 4 5 and 6 show how the percentage of THDN in the Moon Evolution 860As output varied with output power into respectively 8 4 and 2 ohms The downward slope of the traces in these graphs below 10W or so indicates that the actual distortion lies below the already low noise floor at low powers The gentle rise in THDN above 10W suggests that the circuit uses only a modest amount of negative feedback though there is a sharp knee when actual waveform clipping starts to occurFig4 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThe Moon Evolution 860A is specified as being able to deliver 200Wpc into 8 ohms or 400Wpc into 4 ohms both powers equivalent to 23dBW However figs4–6 indicate that with our usual definition of clipping as the power when the THDN reaches 1 the Simaudio delivers 180Wpc into 8 ohms  or 290W into 4 ohms  both figures taken with both channels driven or 465W into 2 ohms  one channel driven The wall AC voltage was 1226V with no signal being amplified and 1213V at the clipping point into 4 or 2 ohms so that doesnt explain the slight shortfall in maximum output power Even so the Moon Evolution 860A is still a very powerful amplifierMeasured at 1267V—equivalent to 20Wpc into 8 ohms 40Wpc into 4 ohms or 80W into 2 ohms—the THDN percentage remained very low into higher impedances and the rise of THD in the top two octaves was mild  The amplifier was clearly less comfortable driving high frequencies at this power level into 2 ohms though the THDN remains below 01 The distortion signature primarily a mix of the second and third harmonics  remains low in level even at very high powers into 4 ohms  Intermodulation distortion at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen was also low  the difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 200W peak into 4 ohms lying at –86dB Fig7 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A THDN  vs frequency at 1267V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A 1kHz waveform at 15W into 8 ohms 0005 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms Fig10 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms Other than the slight shortfall in maximum power output the Moon Evolution 860A lives up to Simaudios reputation for excellent audio engineering
