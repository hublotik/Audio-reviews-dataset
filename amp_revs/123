0, Roksan Kandy K2 BT    on an amplifier I run it for an hour with both channels operating at onethird its specified maximum power into 8 ohms Like the earlier Kandy K2 reviewed by Art Dudley in May 2010 the K2 BT got very hot after 30 minutes at which point I cut short the conditioningThe first test I usually perform with an amplifier after this preconditioning period is to examine its behavior with squarewaves The original K2s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was excellent with a very short risetime  By contrast the K2 BTs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  had long risetimes equating to a limited ultrasonic response It turned out that the Roksans frequency response depends to a larger extent than usual on its volumecontrol setting Fig2 shows the amplifiers response with the volume control set to 9 oclock  12 oclock  and 3 oclock  At the lowest setting of the control the output is down by 3dB at 95kHz but with it set to 12 oclock which is where Id measured the squarewave response the –3dB point has moved down to 24kHz Increasing the volume past that point increased the ultrasonic bandwidth and at 3 oclock the –3dB point was 35kHz while with the control set to its maximum  the –3dB output lay at 115kHz Note too that the channel matching also changes with the setting of the volume control the maximum difference between the channel gains  occurring with the volume control set to 12 oclockFig1 Roksan Kandy K2 BT smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig2 Roksan Kandy K2 BT frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with volume control set to 9 oclock  12 oclock  3 oclock  Fig3 Roksan Kandy K2 BT volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  In most respects the K2 BT measured very similarly to the K2 with an input impedance of around 23k ohms an output impedance of 01 ohm at low and middle frequencies and a maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms of 373dB 58dB of which came from the preamplifier section The K2 BT also preserved absolute polarity for all its inputs including phono Though the maximum power listed in the BTs specifications was greater at 140Wpc vs 125Wpc the measured power at clipping into 8 ohms  was 140Wpc  compared with 137Wpc for the original K2 The clipping power into 4 ohms was also very similar at just under 200Wpc  as was the distortion signature which was predominantly second harmonic  The phono inputs RIAA error  assessed at the preamplifier output jacks was identical to that of the earlier version with minimal error in the audioband but a slight rise at ultrasonic frequenciesFig4 Roksan Kandy K2 BT distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Roksan Kandy K2 BT distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6

Bluetooth input that distinguishes this version of the Kandy from the one that AD reviewed and performance of the K2 BTs Bluetooth input using both an iPad 2 which uses the default AAC codec and my 2012 MacBook Pro which has the betterperforming aptX codec  Because the Bluetooth connection uses a lossy codec measuring its performance is no straightforward task Playing files with iTunes with its volume control set to the maximum the Roksans analog output waveform assessed at the preamplifier output jacks was severely clipped I had to back off the MacBooks volume control to approximately 90 before the K2 BTs output waveform was free from clipping at that point the level was 23V So if you use the Roksans BT input keep your sources volume control down However when I sent the K2 BT dithered 16bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS there was no 1kHz content in the spectrum of the amplifiers output This was presumably because Id set the laptops volume control to 90 to avoid clipping which had dropped the tone below the 16bit quantization floor Resetting my laptops volume control to its maximum and repeating the analysis gave a spectrum with a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  However the noise floor is hashylookingFig8 Roksan Kandy K2 BT spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data sourced from MacBook Pro running aptX  The Bluetooth connection is limited to sample rates of 441 and 48kHz and a bit depth of 16 The BT inputs impulse response was that of a conventional timesymmetrical linearphase reconstruction filter  while the frequency response with 441kHz data featured a gentle rolloff in the top audio octave that reached –1dB at 20kHz  With a fullscale 1kHz tone  the aptX codecs limited bit budget results in the noise floor rising below 7kHz while with the gapped multitone test signal that I discussed in the Arcam review  the codec preserves as much resolution in the midrange and low treble where human hearing is sensitive compared with the top two octaves where hearing sensitivity decreases Tested with the 16bit JTest signal which comprises a highlevel tone at onequarter the sample rate and an LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave the rise in the noise floor in the top octaves masks both any jitter artifacts and the oddorder harmonics of the squarewave Fig9 Roksan Kandy K2 BT Bluetooth frequency response at 441kHz  Fig10 Roksan

running aptX  As I wrote in the Arcam review the aptX codec throws away absolute resolution in favor of preserving a random noise floor because this will be less annoying with music But the true test of a lossy codec is to listen to it which is what HR did of course
