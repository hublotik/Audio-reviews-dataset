0, Audionet Max monoblocks     of a power amplifier I precondition it by running it at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes with a 1kHz tone This power level results in the highest thermal stress on the output devices of an amplifier having a classB or AB output stage The Max turned itself off after 42 minutes its front panel displaying the message SEVERE ERROR OVERHEATING The Audionets top panel at that point was fairly hot at 1173°F What I found interesting about the amplifiers behavior was that its THDnoise which was extraordinarily low with the amplifier cold at 00008 stayed close to that level for almost the entire 42 minutes but then rose to around 003  If I then reduced the level of the input signal so that the output power was lower than onethird power the THDN remained around 003 If I didnt reduce the input level the amplifier turned itself off several seconds after the increase in THD I let the amplifier cool down for a couple of hours then resumed testing The Maxs protection circuits kicked in several times during the measuring when I was operating it at high powers particularly at high frequencies giving me the message SEVERE ERROR HIGH FREQUENCY Each time I let the amplifier cool down before continuing the testingFig1 Audionet Max THDN The voltage gain into 8 ohms for the balanced input was a low 234dB Unusually the gain via the unbalanced inputs was 6dB higher Both inputs preserved absolute polarity the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot The input impedances were close to the specified values at 35k ohms unbalanced and 3k ohms balanced The latter is very low if this amplifier is used with tubed preamps which typically have a high output impedance at low frequencies the bass will sound rolled offThe output impedance was very low at 0045 ohm  at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 007 ohm at 20kHz The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by just ±005dB  The Max offered a wide smallsignal bandwidth with the response into 8 ohms  down by just over 1dB at 200kHz The Audionets reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  thus featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing was visibleFig2 Audionet Max frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig3 Audionet Max smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsNot only does the Audionet Max have very low distortion—it is also very quiet Its unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground was a superb 854dB which increased to 985dB when the measurement was Aweighted Fig4 reveals that the only spuriae present in the output were at the 60Hz supply frequency and its oddorder harmonics but these are all at very low levelsFig4 Audionet Max spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Audionet Max exceeded its specified output power of 400W into 8 ohms  clipping at 450W into that load  Note that in this graph the actual distortion lies beneath the noise at powers below 30W indicated by the upward slope of the trace as the power decreases Fig6 reveals that the amplifier also exceeded its specified power of 700W into 4 ohms  clipping at 750W  The Max clipped at the specified 1100W into 2 ohms  though the AC wall voltage had dropped from 123V to 1185V at the clip pointFig5 Audionet Max distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Audionet Max distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 plots the THDnoise percentage against frequency at a level 20V that is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms and where I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise Even so the THDN percentage remains very low with only slight rises in the top octave and into the lower impedance I havent shown the THDN plotted against frequency into 2 ohms at this level  as despite repeated attempts the amplifiers protection circuit cut in and displayed the SEVERE ERROR HIGH FREQUENCY message At low frequencies and high powers into low impedances the highestlevel distortion harmonic was the third  though with a 1kHz tone at the same output voltage into 8 ohms the second harmonic was the highest in level  Intermodulation distortion was also extremely low  even at a level close to visual waveform clipping on an oscilloscope where the 1kHz difference product rose from –120dB  to –96dB

into 8 ohms Fig10 Audionet Max HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms Fig11 Audionet Max HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 300W peak into 8 ohms As I am coming to expect from expensive German amplifiers Audionets Max performed very well on the test bench offering high powers with very low levels of distortion and noise It doesnt quite have enough heatsink capacity for its poweroutput capability but I suspect that that shortcoming will not be a problem in normal use especially given its very effective protection circuitry  My only reservation concerned its very low balanced input impedance but this wont be an issue with modern solidstate preamps and digital source components
