0, Mark Levinson No5805 integrated amplifier  than the one auditioned by Jim Austin  There were some setup issues with this early sample—the firmware was version 136—but these were generally solved by rebooting  Mark Levinson No5805   and before performing any testing I ran the amplifier for an hour at onethird power into 8 ohms  At the end of this time the No5805s top panel was quite warm at 1205°F  and the internal heatsinks measured 1337°F  Commendably this amplifier has enough heatsink capacity for sustained operation at high powersLooking first at the linelevel analog inputs With the volume control at its maximum setting of 80 the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 325dB from the speaker terminals for both balanced and unbalanced input signals and 8dB from both the preamplifier and headphone outputs which is slightly but inconsequentially lower than the specified 85dB The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  from all the outputs The unbalanced input impedance was 16k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly to 135k ohms at 20kHz while the balanced input impedance was 20k ohms across the audioband The preamplifier output had a low output impedance of 52 ohms this close to the specified 55 ohms and the headphone output was a very low 28 ohms Both values were consistent from 20Hz to 20kHzThe output impedance at the speaker terminals  was a little higher than specified at 015 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 017 ohm at 20kHz The modulation of the Mark Levinsons frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±01dB  The amplifiers output is down by 02dB at 20kHz and rolls off above the audioband reaching –3dB at 60kHz A 10kHz squarewave was therefore reproduced with short risetimes  and no overshoot or ringing The excellent channel matching in fig1 taken with a balanced input and the volume control set to its maximum was preserved at lower settings of the control The ultrasonic response extended a little higher reaching –3dB at 110kHz with the volume control set to 60 which was equivalent to 19dB before full volumeFig1 Mark Levinson No5805 line input volume control at max frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Mark Levinson No5805 line input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe No5805s channel separation was excellent at 90dB in both directions below 2kHz to 20kHz and still 74dB at 20kHz With the line inputs shorted to ground the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured 605dB  Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 647dB and an Aweighting filter increased the ratio to 679dB These ratios were measured with the volume control set to its maximum which is very much a worst case Reducing the volume control to 60 increased the ratio by 14dB which suggests the noise is being picked up by the circuitry before the volume control Fig3 shows the lowfrequency spectrum of the No5805s output while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms with the volume control set to 80 The highestlevel spuriae are at the AC powerline frequency of 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics presumably due to magnetic coupling from the power transformerFig3 Mark Levinson No5805 line input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Mark Levinson specifies the No5805 as delivering a maximum power of 125Wpc into 8 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive in both channels the No5805 exceeded that spec delivering 1335Wpc into 8 ohms  With both channels driven into 4 ohms the amplifier clipped at 210Wpc  and into 2 ohms with one channel driven it clipped at 370W Fig4 Mark Levinson No5805 line input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms both channels drivenFig5 Mark Levinson No5805 line input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms both channels drivenFig6 Mark Levinson No5805 line input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms one channel drivenThe downward slope of the traces at levels below 50W or so in figs4 and 5 implies that actual distortion lies beneath the noise floor so I looked at how the No5805s THDN percentage varied with frequency at a level of 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The distortion levels were low in the bass and midrange in both channels into 8 4 and 2 ohms  and the usual rise at higher frequencies due to the circuits decreasing openloop bandwidth was smaller than usual in the left channel  and nonexistent in the right  The shape of the distortionspuriae waveform in the right channel  suggests that the third harmonic was dominant at low powers but the second harmonic was actually the highest in level around 4dB below the clipping power  Highorder intermodulation products resulting from an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms were low in level  and the secondorder difference product lay at just –77dB Fig7 Mark Levinson No5805 line input distortion  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8 Mark Levinson No5805 line input 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8

input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms Turning to the No5805s digital inputs the optical SPDIF inputs locked to datastreams with sample rates up to 96kHz the coaxial input up to 192kHz All digital inputs preserved absolute polarity Apples USB Prober utility identified the No5805 as No580x from HARMAN and confirmed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the USB port could handle 16 and 24bit integer data at all sample rates up to 384kHz With the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at 0dBFS resulted in output levels of 56V at the preamp and headphone outputs A signal at –12dBFS gave rise to 294V into 8 ohms at the speaker outputs which is equivalent to 108W into 8 ohms As is often the case with integrated amplifiers offering digital inputs these have around 10dB too much gain compared with the linelevel analog inputs I continued testing the Mark Levinsons digital inputs from the preamplifier outputs with the power amplifier stage turned off using the menuThe No5805 offers a choice between seven different reconstruction filters that can be set individually for each digital input Apodizing Fast Brickwall Fast Linear Fast Minimum Hybrid Fast Slow Linear and Slow Minimum Looking at each filters impulse response with 441kHz data indicates there are three—Apodizing Fast Brickwall and Fast Linear—that all have similar linearphase timedomain behavior  The Slow Linear filter was still linearphase in nature but with a much lower amount of symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS  The Fast Minimum filter was as its name suggests a minimumphase type with all the ringing following the single high sample  while the Slow Minimum filter had less ringing  The Hybrid Fast filter had a small amount of ringing before the high sample and more after  In this respect it appears identical to the Hybrid filter used in ProJects Pre Box S2 Digital processor  which I preferred when I auditioned that DACFig11 Mark Levinson No5805 digital input Apodizing Fast filter impulse response Fig12 Mark Levinson No5805 digital

Fig15 Mark Levinson No5805 digital input Hybrid Fast filter impulse response With 441kHzsampled white noise the Apodizing Fast Brickwall and Hybrid Fast filters all rolled off rapidly above the audioband reaching full stopband suppression at half the sample rate  With the Fast Linear and Fast Minimum filters full stopband attenuation was reached at 24kHz with the aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz suppressed by almost 110dB  The Slow Linear and Slow Minimum filters behaved similarly in the frequency domain with a slow rolloff above 20kHz with 441kHzsampled white noise  and the aliased 25kHz image  suppressed by 23dB The harmonics of this tone however were all extremely low in levelFig16 Mark Levinson No5805 digital input Hybrid Fast filter wideband spectrum of white

with data sampled at 441kHz Fig18 Mark Levinson No5805 digital input Slow Linear filter wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz The Mark Levinsons digital frequency response with the two Slow filters and with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHz follows the same basic shape at each sample rate with a sharp rolloff above 17kHz with 441kHz data  The response with 441kHz data with the Fast filters extended to 20kHz  Channel separation for the digital inputs measured at the preamplifier outputs was superb at 120dB at and below 1kHz When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor dropped by about 12dB in the top two audio octaves meaning that the No5805 offers around 18 bits worth of resolution in this region though a little less in the bass and midrange With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was symmetrical though some HF noise was present With undithered 24bit data the result was a slightly noisy sinewave Fig19 Mark Levinson No5805 digital input Slow Linear

undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit TosLink data Intermodulation distortion via the No5805s digital inputs was extraordinarily low the difference product at 1kHz with a fullscale mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones lying at –110dB  This graph was taken with the Fast Linear filter The 1kHz product was even lower in level with the Slow filters but as expected the aliased images of the primary tones were only suppressed by 20dB or so  When  digital inputs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit JTest data the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were all at the correct levels  However three spurious tones can be seen these having frequencies of 938kHz 961kHz and 989kHz I have no idea where these tones arise from and they were present with all digital inputs and with 24bit data  However as they lie around –110dB I doubt they will have audible consequencesFig23 Mark Levinson No5805 digital input Fast Linear filter HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at

±35kHz MM and MC phono inputs performance behavior I floated the signal generators outputs and ran a separate ground connection from the binding post next to the amplifiers phono input RCAs which gave the lowest level of noise For the MC input I set the appropriate DIP switch for each channel to its Ground position With the volume control at its maximum setting the MM inputs voltage gain at 1kHz measured 481dB from the preamplifier and headphone outputs and 745dB from the speaker outputs The MCs gain measured at the preamplifier outputs was a very high 778dB All three outputs preserved absolute polarity with both MM and MC phono input signals The MM input impedance was 54k ohms at 20Hz 49k ohms and 41k ohms at 20kHz these impedances appropriate for MM cartridges With the MC inputs impedance set to 1000 ohms I measured an impedance of 770 ohms With it set to 37 ohms which I understood to be Jim Austins preference it measured exactly 37 ohmsThe phonostage RIAA error was very low in the treble and midrange and precisely matched between channels but featured a 06dB plateau in the bass  With the phono inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to 80 the MM inputs wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured a good 64dB in both channels An Aweighting filter increased the ratios to an excellent 825dB The MC inputs unweighted wideband SN ratios were even better at 70dB in the left channel 675dB in the right both ref 1kHz at 5007181V These ratios increased to 828dB and 808dB respectively The No5805s phono preamplifier inputs are very quietFig27 Mark Levinson No5805 MM phono input response with RIAA correction  The MM inputs overload margins were good across the audioband at just over 17dB However and perhaps due to the MC inputs higherthanusual gain the overload margins for this input measured a low 76dB from 20Hz to 20kHz which suggests that this input is optimized for lowoutput movingcoil cartridges Both harmonic distortion  and intermodulation distortion  measured with the MM input at 12dB ref 1kHz at 5mV were very low in levelFig28 Mark Levinson No5805 MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave at 20mV input DC–10kHz Fig29
