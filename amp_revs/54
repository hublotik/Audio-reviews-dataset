0, Constellation Performance Centaur II 500    I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time the Constellations enclosure was hottest toward the rear of the top panel at 1013°F The voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 259dB for both balanced and unbalanced signals and 12dB for the Direct input All sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  The unbalanced input impedance was 10k ohms and the balanced input impedance 20k ohms both from 20Hz to 20kHz These impedances are significantly lower than the specified 100k ohms unbalanced and 200k ohms balanced but are identical to those published for the original Centaur II amplifierThe output impedance including a 6 spacedpair speaker cable was a very low 008 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 01 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the modulation of the Constellations frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was less than ±01dB  The Centaur II 500s frequency response into 8 ohms was down by just 05dB at 200kHz  as a result a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with very short risetimes  and there was no overshoot or ringing Fig1 reveals that the ultrasonic output rolls off a little earlier with lower impedances but the response into 2 ohms  is still flat within the audiobandFig1 Constellation Centaur II 500 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Constellation Centaur II 500 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was 90dB in both directions in the midrange and below and still 83dB at the top of the audioband The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the inputs shorted to ground was a high 741dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to an excellent 85dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 89dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor  indicated that the AC powersupply–related harmonics were primarily at 120Hz and its harmonics but some oddorder harmonics of the 60Hz line frequency were present in the right channel  All of these spuriae lay at or below –90dB  howeverFig3 Constellation Centaur II 500 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Centaur II 500 is specified as outputting 500Wpc into 8 ohms  1000Wpc into 4 ohms  or 1600Wpc into 2 ohms  With clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1 I measured clipping powers of 550Wpc into 8 ohms  and 880Wpc into 4 ohms  While this latter power is less than specified note that I do not hold the wall voltage constant during these tests The 06dB measured shortfall into 4 ohms will not be any kind of problem However when I tried to measure the maximum output power into 2 ohms with one channel driven that channel turned off at 700W  and wouldnt turn back on Each channel is protected by two 10A and two 30A fuses and it turned out that one of the 10A fuses had blown Replacing the fuse brought that channel back to lifeFig4 Constellation Centaur II 500 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Constellation Centaur II 500 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsTo be certain that I was measuring actual distortion I examined how the M15s percentage of THDN varied with frequency at a fairly high level 20V  The percentage of THDN was extremely low in the bass and midrange  and while there was the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in openloop voltage gain as the frequency increases this was still not to a significant amountFig6 Constellation Centaur II 500 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The THDN waveform at this level into 8 ohms  indicates that the distortion is predominantly thirdharmonic in nature at –80dB  though there was also some second harmonic present in the left channel  At the same voltage into 4 ohms  the third harmonic dropped and the second harmonic became the highest in level in both channels and was almost matched by the fifth harmonic at –94dB  Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones the Constellation produced low levels of intermodulation distortion even at high powers into low impedances  with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –86dB  and the higherorder products at or below –84dB Fig7 Constellation Centaur II 500 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00012 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Constellation Centaur II 500 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 80W into 8 ohms Fig9 Constellation Centaur II 500 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 160W into 4 ohms Fig10 Constellation Centaur II 500 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 160W peak into 4 ohms Its measured performance indicates that Constellations Centaur II 500 is a powerhouse of an amplifier
