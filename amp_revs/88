0, Pass Labs INT150 I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before doing the testing I ran the INT150 at onethird its rated power for 60 minutes which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage At the end of that period the heatsinks along the chassis sides were way too hot to touch This amplifier needs plenty of ventilationThe maximum gain at 1kHz was basically to specification at 264dB into 8 ohms for both balanced and unbalanced inputs These inputs were noninverting assessed at both the loudspeaker jacks and the preamplifier outputs and the XLR jacks appear to be wired with pin 2 hot The singleended input impedance was at 42k ohms twice the specified figure at low and midrange frequencies dropping slightly to 33k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was twice these values as expected The balanced preamplifier outputs offered a source impedance of 129 ohms over most of the audioband rising to 426 ohms at 20Hz There was a slight  insertion loss from these outputs ie a 1V input resulted in an output at the preamp jacks of 920mVThe INT150s output impedance at the speaker terminals was a fairly low 012 ohm in the bass and midrange rising slightly to 016 ohm at 20kHz As a result the frequencyresponse modification due to the interaction between this impedance and the way a speakers impedance varies with frequency was mild at ±01dB  The Passs output is flat almost down to the 10Hz LF limit of this graph at the other end of the spectrum the response is –01dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 125kHz This wide bandwidth results in an excellent 10kHz square waveform with short risetimes but no overshoot or ringing  These graphs were taken with the volume control at its maximum setting 63 commendably reducing the setting to an indicated 40 didnt change the amplifiers bandwidth The volume control operated in accurate 1dB steps The frontpanel volume control which is actually a rotary shaft encoder worked perfectly throughout my testing so I am not sure why it failed during ELs auditioningFig1 Pass Labs INT150 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Pass Labs INT150 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 2kHz and still 90dB at 20kHz The INT150 was also very quiet With the volume control at 63 but the input shorted the wideband signalnoise ratio was 798dB in the left channel and 763dB in the right ref 1W into 8 ohms Switching in an Aweighting filter increased these figures to 85 and 80dB respectivelySpecified as delivering 150Wpc into 8 ohms at 1 THD  the INT150 proved more powerful than that on my test bench giving 191W into 8 ohms  at this distortion level with both channels driven  It output 284Wpc into 4 ohms  but only 225W into 2 ohms  with one channel driven With both channels driven into 2 ohms the rearpanel 4A fuse blew after just 15 seconds of continuous running at powers greater than 100WFig3 Pass Labs INT150 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsThe shape of the traces in fig3 reveals that the THDnoise percentage is dominated by noise below 8W or so I therefore measured how the distortion changed with frequency at a level of 10V equivalent to 125W into 8 ohms  25W into 4 ohms  and 50W into 2 ohms  The right channel is not quite as linear as the left but the INT150 still offers uniformly low distortion below 1kHz into all loads The THD rises in the top octaves due to the usual reduction in openloop gain margin at high frequencies and the amplifier is starting to be stressed a little above 10kHz into 2 ohmsFig4 Pass Labs INT150 THDN  vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Into 8 ohms at moderate powers the distortion is primarily the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  but higherorder harmonics appear at higher powers and into lower impedances  The third harmonic remains the highest in level but at even higher powers some oddorder harmonics of the AC power supply can be seen  I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the test system including floating the AC cord and running a separate connection from the systems chassis ground to the grounding post on the amplifiers rear panel but there was no significant change in this behaviorFig5 Pass Labs INT150 1kHz waveform at 14W

notched out Fig7 Pass Labs INT150 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–10kHz at 55Wpc into 4 ohms The circuits lessgood linearity at high frequencies doesnt result in any significant secondorder intermodulation product with the demanding highpower mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones the 1kHz difference component lying at almost –100dB  However the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz are almost 40dB higher in level Fig8 Pass Labs INT150 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms As I have come to expect from a Nelson Pass design the INT150 offers excellent measured performance in most respects
