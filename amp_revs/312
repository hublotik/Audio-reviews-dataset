0, Topping MX3 DAC Bluetooth Headphone Amplifier and Power amplifier You even get a remote control with it Despite all that functionality it costs just USD 130 from Amazon including Prime shipping I bought mine from Massdrop 10 months ago I dont know what I paid but likely lessFrom the outside the MX3 looks quite attractiveIt has the same design language as the Topping DX3 Pro but even more attractive with that slanted logo The volume control is digital and very sensitive There is a ton of functionality here which I wont go into as there is a good review of it from Z which I will post after this review Suffice it to say it is very feature rich and well designed for such a bargain productEverything is powered by an external laptop sized switching power supplyNot only is extra expense incurred in getting a Topping branded power supply but typical of them it comes with full compliance with regulatory bodies both in US and EUFor most of my testing I used the USB input but did give the Aux analog input a try as well I did not test the subwoofer out Not did I play with BluetoothIf the MX3 performs it will be the audio miracle of modern times so lets get into measurements But first a note I had to take some shortcuts to get through all of this functionality I think it represents the missing measurementsDAC MeasurementsThere are no line outs on the MX3 so I used the headphone output set to 2 volts to get our dashboard viewOh no Distortion is fairly high putting the MX3 in bottom class of all DACs testedThis is quite a bit worse than any DAC Topping has produced and will set the limit for the rest of the measurementsHeadphone Amplifier MeasurementsLets start with our all important power versus distortionnoise at 300 ohmThe higher noise and distortion in the dashboard comes into play here putting the MX3 fair bit behind its lookalike Topping DX3 Pro At 33 milliwatt power before clipping there is not sufficient amount for a desktop amplifier Then again if you listen to the DX3 Pro in low gain there is more power here than thereUsing 33 ohm load we examine the current delivery of the headphone amplifierSimilar story here except 230 milliwatts is good amount of power for low impedance headphonesI was pleasantly surprised to see a very low output impedance in MX3This means you can use any headphone with the MX3 and not have its frequency response change because of output impedancePower Amplifier Audio MeasurementsOur dashboard for power amplifier calls for 5 watts of outputThe amplifier is quite a bit worse than the DAC showing a disappointing SINAD  of just 68 dB This is not performance you want to brag about to your friendsHere is the full power curve into 4 ohm loadUsually amplifiers keep reducing their THDN as the signal gets stronger relative to noise Not so here Distortion is high enough that at just 1 watt it starts to dominate and flattens the curve until clipping at about 30 watts More power can be had if you get it spike up a bit as shown so the unit meets its spec of I think 40 watts into 4 ohmHere is the THDN versus power versus frequencyThe issue here is rising distortion in high frequencies regardless of amount of power being output 1 kHz test tone we use in the dashboard then is almost the best case scenario By the way the above test was performed with Aux input so that I could vary the input voltage as I do with other power amplifiersHere is out signal to noise ratioSo not quite as good as CDs dynamic rangeListening TestsI only tested the headphone amplifier this way I will at some point start testing with speakersWith Sennheiser HD650 high impedance headphone there was good bit of power giving a physical sensation of bass Alas by then distortion would set it and the sound would get bright and corruptedThings changed with much lower impedance Hifiman HE400i There was plenty of volume here and I had to try really hard to get it to distort It would do so but at levels I did not want to listen to for more than a second or two Bass sensation was quite good bringing the full dynamic range out of these headphones which lesser powered headphone amplifiers cannotConclusionsThe only bright spot in the Topping MX3 performance is its headphone amplifier especially with low impedance headphones Outside of that the MX3 disappoints While nothing is broken and design clearly verified  the bar was set quite low to meet the price point Is the MX3 transparent enough Probably for most people Is it transparent enough for me to recommend it No You are much better off with discrete components You will be paying more though to get that performanceAm I being too critical We had fish chips yesterday at our favorite waterfront restaurant and it cost 57 for the three of us Two of those meals and you can have the Topping MX3 So the value is incredible Let me know what you think
