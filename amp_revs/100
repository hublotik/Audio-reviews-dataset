0, Vinnie Rossi LIO   With its modular topology offering optional phono and digitalinput stages the choice between a switchedresistor volume control and an autotransformer volume control an optional tubed line stage a headphone amplifier and a MOSFET power amplifier the LIO is actually eight products in one and presents a complex target for measurements I tested most of the configurations fully with spot checks elsewhereTo minimize strain on the amplifiers output stage  performance of the phono and DA modules at the fixedlevel outputs with the poweramplifier outputs disabled The movingmagnet input offered a gain of 349dB the two movingcoil inputs  a gain of 5775dB both lower than the respective specified gains of 40 and 60dB Both MM and MC inputs preserved absolute polarityThe MM input impedance was close to the specified 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies though it dropped to 38k ohms at the top of the audioband The review sample was fitted with the remotely adjustable input impedance for the MC inputs which can be adjusted from a maximum value of 2k ohms to 26 ohms I spotchecked the input impedance at 20Hz 1kHz and 20kHz with the impedance set to 99 ohms 499 ohms and 2k ohms However I got anomalous measurements Regardless of the setting the input impedance at 20kHz measured close to 60 ohms at 20Hz it was between 200 and 260 ohms While the MC input impedance did increase or decrease with the setting at 1kHz I measured 817 ohms at a nominal 2k ohms 543 ohms at a nominal 499 ohms and 307 ohms at a nominal 99 ohms The phono stages output impedance was 1300 ohms at 20Hz and around 42 ohms in the midrange and aboveThe MM input featured superbly accurate RIAA deemphasis with excellent matching between channels a wide ultrasonic response and a gentle lowfrequency rolloff of –1dB at 25Hz  However the MC inputs had a 5dB peak at 18kHz with a sharp rolloff above that frequency  Channel separation was excellent at 85dB over most of the audioband and the phono inputs were very quiet offering signalnoise ratios of around 63dB for both MM and MC stages measured with those inputs shorted to ground and the measurement bandwidth restricted to the audiobandFig1 Vinnie Rossi LIO Phonostage response with RIAA correction MM input  MC input  Overload margins at low and middle frequencies were good for both MM and MC inputs at 19dB  and 17dB  but the highfrequency overload margin was only okay for the MM input  and poor for the MC input  Distortion was a little higher than normal though predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  But even at the equivalent MM level of 1kHz at 5mV highfrequency intermodulation was poor with the difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at just –33dB

100k ohms Turning to the digital input module  USB input using my MacBook Pro running on battery power Apples USB Prober utility identified the module as XMOS USB 20 Audio Out and confirmed that it operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode The TosLink input accepted 24bit data with sample rates up to 96kHz the coaxial input 24 bits up to 192kHz while the USB input accepted 32bit integer data with sample rates up to 384kHzMeasured at the Fixed preamp output data representing a 1kHz tone at 0dBFS gave a level of 2205V However measured with the Resistor Volume Control  module set to its maximum a 1kHz tone at –12dBFS resulted in a level of 1082V into 8 ohms from the MOSFET amplifier modules outputs This is very close to the amplifiers clipping point  so the RVC and the Autoformer Volume Control  each needs to be set well below its maximum level in order to avoid overloading the amplifier module with digital inputsFigs 4 and 5 show the impulse responses at 441kHz of the Linear Phase and Minimum Phase reconstruction filters respectively and reveal that each filter performs exactly as advertised Performing the test first described by MBLs Jürgen Reis—in which the DAC is fed first 441kHz data representing a fullscale 191kHz tone then data representing white noise—both filters behaved identically Fig6 shows the result of this test with Filter 1 the Linear Phase filter The noise signal  reveals that the audioband response extends up to more than 20kHz with then a sharp rolloff reaching the stopband noise floor at 24kHz The ultrasonic sampling image of the 191kHz tone at 25kHz is suppressed by 110dB and all the distortion harmonics lie at or below –93dB Fig4 Vinnie Rossi LIO digital input Filter 1 impulse response at 441kHz Fig5 Vinnie Rossi LIO digital input Filter 2 impulse response at 441kHz Fig6 Vinnie Rossi LIO digital input Filter 1 wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig7 shows the frequency response of the LIOs digital module with sample rates of 441 96 192 and 384kHz With all four rates the response is flat within the audioband and with the two lower rates it extends almost to half the sample rate before dropping off very sharply With the two higher rates the response starts to roll off gently above 50kHz with the 384kHz ultrasonic response extending slightly higher than that at 192kHz Again the two filters behaved identically on this testFig7 Vinnie Rossi LIO digital input Filter 1 frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Fed first 16bit data then 24bit data each representing a dithered 1kHz tone at exactly –90dBFS the drop in the noise floor with the increase in bit depth was just over 10dB  implying resolution of almost 18 bits This test was performed with TosLink data I repeated the test with USB data and got identical results indicating that the USB input does correctly handle hirez data However I was puzzled by the appearance of very lowlevel spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics in this graph given the hefty ultracapacitor power supply which is charged with 24V DC by the outboard supplyFig8 Vinnie Rossi LIO digital input waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data The LIO correctly handled 16 and 24bit undithered data  and offered low levels of harmonic distortion with the second harmonic dominant at –80dB  Intermodulation distortion  was also very low Tested for its rejection of wordclock jitter the modules USB input performed very well as expected There are no jitterrelated sidebands present with 16bit441kHz JTest data  though there is an odd rise in the noise floor either side of the primary tone This was also present with 24bit JTest data However with 16 and 24bit TosLink data sidebands appeared at ±60 ±120 and ±180Hz  This too puzzled me—there should be no ACline–related components present at all given the LIOs massively stiff power supplyFig9 Vinnie Rossi LIO digital input waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit data Fig10 Vinnie Rossi LIO digital input spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at

LIO digital input highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit data from AP SYS2722 via Toslink  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzThe LIOs headphoneamplifier module follows whichever volumecontrol option has been fitted and is connected in parallel with the Variable preamp outputs and the input of the MOSFET amplifier module if fitted It offered a maximum gain of 13dB with the AVC and inverted signal polarity The output impedance was a suitably low 6 ohms at low and middle frequencies though this rose to 185 ohms at 20kHz Though the audioband response was flat and well matched between channels I was surprised to find a 10dB peak at 35kHz with the AVC feeding the headphone module Fig14 Vinnie Rossi LIO Headphone output Autoformer Volume Control set to 43 frequency response at 1V into 600 ohms With linelevel signals the AVC module preserved absolute polarity  Set to its maximum level of 63 the AVC had low input impedances of 48 and 75k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz respectively and a very low impedance of just 400 ohms at 20kHz This last will stress many tubed source components but fortunately the input impedance increased at lower settings With the AVC set to 43 for example the input impedance measured 92k ohms at 1kHz and 585k ohms at 10kHz The Resistor Volume Control  set to its maximum of 63 offers unity gain and an input impedance of 28k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping slightly to 213k ohms at 20kHz behavior of the Tubestage using the RVC module at the Variable preamplifier outputs It offers an insertion loss of just over 07dB ie fed 1V at 1kHz it outputs 921mV and the module preserved absolute polarity Its output impedance was a low 53 ohms at 20kHz and 1kHz though this rose to 1450 ohms at 20Hz The Tubestage was reasonably linear—with a 50Hz tone at 300mV into 100k ohms the second harmonic was the highest in level and lay at –64dB Fig15 Vinnie Rossi LIO Tubestage Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage volume control set to maximum spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 300mV into 100k ohms  MOSFET amplifier module in four setups 1 with the RVC module and the Tubestage 2 with the RVC and no Tubestage using the little bypass module in the latters place 3 with the AVC which replaces both the RVC and the Tubestage and 4 without any volumecontrol module which appears to send the selected input signal straight to the amplifier module The maximum voltage gain at the speaker terminals into 8 ohms varied with each of these conditions 334dB with the AVC and a significantly lower 258dB with and without the RVC or Tubestage Comparisons among these different volume control modules will be misleading unless the different gains are compensated forThe MOSFET amplifier modules input impedance was a reasonably high 40k ohms Its output impedance was low at 012 ohm at 20Hz 0084 ohm at 1kHz and 0086 ohm at 20kHz which gave a very small variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  Fig16 taken with the Tubestage driving the amplifier module and the RVC set to 63 shows excellent channel matching and a wide smallsignal bandwidth However when I repeated this test with the AVC also set to 63 a 13dB peak at 34kHz appeared The height of this peak didnt appear to be affected by the volumecontrol setting though the frequency increased at lower settings Fig17 for example compares the LIOs overall frequency response measured at the speaker terminals with both the RVC and AVC set to 43 The RVCs ultrasonic response  is identical to what it was in fig16 with a –3dB point at 75kHz while with the AVC the 13dB peak now lies at 80kHz The puzzle to me is that this ultrasonic peak with the AVC resulted in no overshoot or ringing with the LIOs squarewave response  I did wonder if there was some sort of interaction between the AVCs transformers and the input of the Audio Precision test set but then I remembered that this peak was also evident with the AVC feeding the LIOs headphone moduleFig16 Vinnie Rossi LIO Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig17 Vinnie Rossi LIO Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage volume control set to 43  Autoformer Volume Control set to 43  frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms Fig18 Vinnie Rossi LIO Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe amplifier modules channel separation was good at 90dB between 1 and 3kHz though it dropped to 64dB at 100Hz and 78dB at 20kHz The unweighted wideband SN ratio measured with the line input shorted and the AVC set to 63 was a good 773dB ref 283V into 8 ohms This improved to 913dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 943dB when Aweighted Again I was puzzled by the appearance of lowlevel spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics in the amplifiers output when it drove 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  The AVC was connected for this measurement and perhaps the transformers were picking up radiated magnetic interference from the computer that runs the Audio Precision software However moving the computer made no differenceFig19 Vinnie Rossi LIO Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The LIO is specified as being able to deliver 25Wpc into 8 ohms  or 45Wpc into 4 ohms  However with our standard definition of clipping being when the THDnoise reaches 1 the LIO didnt reach those powers under that condition It clipped at 17Wpc into 8 ohms  and 30Wpc into 4 ohms  The LIO did meet its specified power into both impedances at 11 THDN however Perhaps more significant is the level of THDN at lower powers which is fairly high These graphs were taken with a signal frequency of 1kHz and the RVC driving the amplifier module changing to the AVC or adding the Tubestage made no difference But when I plotted how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at a voltage level equivalent to 3Wpc into 8 ohms and 6Wpc into 4 ohms it appears that the Tubestage itself contributes distortion at high frequencies Fig22 shows the variation in THD with the AVC fig23 with the Tubestage In both cases the THD level at moderate powers is high Fortunately for the sound quality the distortion is heavily secondharmonic in nature  though plenty of higherorder harmonics are present especially at low frequencies  And given Herb Reicherts positive reaction to the LIOs sound when used as an integrated amplifier with the AVC it is perhaps not surprising that its highfrequency intermodulation performance in this configuration measured at a level close to visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope was not too bad Fig20 Vinnie Rossi LIO Resistor Volume Control set to maximum distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig21 Vinnie Rossi LIO Resistor Volume Control set

DC–1kHz at 3W into 8 ohms Fig26 Vinnie Rossi LIO Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 3W peak into 8 ohms Finally as the LIO is powered by the capacitor supply it will run only a certain length of time from one bank of capacitors before switching to the other With the LIO driving 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms and one capacitor bank newly charged the supply voltage dropped from 229 to 19V in exactly three minutes at which point the LIO automatically switched to the second bank now freshly charged with a justaudible clickI was impressed by the concept underlying the Vinnie Rossi LIO and its physical execution is stunning But other than the RVC movingmagnet Phonostage and Digital modules all of which offered good to excellent measured performance there are problems with the other modules that bothered me Of course the benefit of the approach adopted by Vinnie Rossi with the LIO is that he can introduce running improvements to individual modules without requiring the owner replace the entire chassis Footnote 1 See Art Dudleys Listening column in February 2015
