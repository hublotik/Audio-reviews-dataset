0,My review sample of the PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP  was fitted with EL34 output tubes—I made sure that the bias was correctly set for these tubes before performing any testing After allowing the DiaLogue Premium HP to warm up for an hour or so I used my  system  to examine its measured performance With 4 and 8 ohm outputtransformer taps and the choice of triode  or ultralinear  operation the DiaLogue Premium HP is four amplifiers in one I looked at all four output conditionsThe lowest maximum gain was in triode mode from the 4 ohm tap at 3355dB with the 8 ohm tap 34dB higher The maximum ultralinear gains were 357 and 371dB from the 4 and 8 ohm taps respectively The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  in all four output conditions The input impedance was 32k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz This is usefully high but still much lower than the specified 100k ohmsThe output impedance depended on frequency the transformer tap and the mode of operation The lowest impedance was from the 4 ohm tap in triode mode at 11 ohms from 20Hz to 1kHz rising to 133 ohms at 20kHz Ultralinear mode slightly increased both of these impedances by 01 ohm while the 8 ohm tap almost doubled them Even so these impedances are significantly lower than with other PrimaLuna amplifiers I have measured and the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction of its output impedance with that of the loudspeaker was relatively mild It ranged from ±08dB from the 4 ohm tap in triode mode  to ±13dB from the 8 ohm tap in ultralinear mode Note the peak between 30 and 50kHz in fig1 This peak was at its highest from both taps into 8 ohms and higher impedances but disappeared when the load impedance was well below the nominal transformertap value But with the tap matched to the load this peak was associated with a significant amount of overshoot on a 1kHz squarewave  though a 10kHz squarewave revealed that the consequent ringing was critically damped  the amplifier maintaining its stability The flat tops and bottoms of these squarewaves correlate with the amplifiers extended lowfrequency response PrimaLunas output transformers are of excellent qualityFig1 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP 4

smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP 8 ohm tap ultralinear mode smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum and the channel balance is excellent I repeated the response measurement with the volume control set to 1200 equivalent to a gain reduction from the maximum of 17dB  and the channel balance remained within 025dB and the frequency response didnt change The DiaLogue Premium obviously uses a highquality part for its volume controlChannel separation was adequate in both directions at and below 1kHz at 70dB but decreased to 44dB  and 49dB  at 20kHz The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio in ultralinear mode measured at the 8 ohm tap with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum was okay 686dB left and 696dB right Triode mode improved these ratios by 3dB and Aweighting improved them to 756dB left and 777dB right Spectral analysis of the noise floor  indicated a small level of 60Hz hum in both channels due to magnetic interference from the AC transformer but a slightly higher level of 120Hz in the left channel at around –78dB  This is actually good noise performance for a transformercoupled tube designFig4 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP 8 ohm tap triode mode spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Figs 5–8 show how the THDnoise percentage in the PrimaLunas output varied with power with both channels driven from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms and from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms with triode and ultralinear modes respectively PrimaLuna specifies the maximum output power with EL34 output tubes as 40W into 8 ohms  in triode mode and 70Wpc into 8 ohms  in ultralinear mode We define clipping as when the THDN in an amplifiers output reaches 1 and these graphs show that the DiaLogue Premium didnt reach its specified power at 1 THDN However if the clipping definition is relaxed to 3 THDN the amplifier meets its specified power when the load is matched to the nominal outputtransformer tapFig5 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP 4 ohm tap triode mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium

ohmsFig8 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP 8 ohm tap ultralinear mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsThese graphs also indicate that the PrimaLuna amplifier doesnt offer the lowest distortion though it remains between 01 and 02 at modest power levels Figs 9 and 10 taken at a level of 4V which is when the THD rises above the noise floor reveal that the lowest midfrequency distortion was obtained when the 4 ohm tap was used to drive 8 ohms and was lower in the right channel than the left However the distortion rises at the frequency extremes particularly in the top audio octave and as the load impedance drops These graphs suggest that the 4 ohm tap is best used with loudspeakers whose impedance ranges from 4 to 16 ohms as long as this tap can provide sufficient gainFig9 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP 4 ohm tap triode mode THDN  vs frequency at 4V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig10 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP 4 ohm tap ultralinear mode THDN  vs frequency at 4V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fortunately the distortion is heavily secondharmonic in nature in both modes  even at low frequencies  Peculiarly in this graph the lowfrequency noise floor is higher in the right channel than in the left Despite its reduced linearity at high frequencies the DiaLogue Premium HP performed relatively well on the demanding highfrequency intermodulation test with the 1kHz difference component at an output power of 10W into 8 ohms typically lying at around –60dB Fig11 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP 4 ohm tap triode mode 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  024 THDN

Premium HP 8 ohm tap ultralinear mode HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms Overall the PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP measures well for a design using pushpull pairs of EL34 tubes
