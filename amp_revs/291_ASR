Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 Stereo Class D power amplifier It kindly sent costs US 799 The GaN 5 comes compact enclosure plenty ventilation cost decent looksBeside sole power button blue indicator two red LEDs turn power unit go Strangely amplifier goes protection light getting unit working requires power cycle I like see protection circuits self recover extreme condition goes awayThe back panel shows binding posts close together easy fitment large banana speaker cables But I like inclusion balanced XLR inputsAs see also jumpers change gain setting although range large Most testing medium gain shippedI trouble getting amplifier function initially It would simply output anything I played grounding I seen low end amps cause AP able capture output due high level noise This didnt work first I switched inputs RCA That work either After fiddling switching back balanced input amp sudden started work Not sure much interaction Audio Precision design issue Either way exception rule 95 amplifiers I measuredAs name indicates amplifier uses new Gallium Nitride transistors advantages classic Mosfet transistors All else equal produce higher efficiency better performance expense higher costMini GaN 5 MeasurementsAs noted I started testing medium gain produced near nominal 29 dB standard amplifiers XLR input used per introductionWell disappointing Distortion fairly high causing SINAD sum distortionnoise worse number budget desktop amplifiersNoise performance good eitherI trouble getting amplifier go full power right graph It would shut 07 volt input Strangely later accepted higher levels input I think impulse nature measurement causing trouble So maybe produce higher SNR higher power still none competitiveOn hand crosstalk goodMultitone performance also reasonableWhat reasonable high dependence speaker load comes frequency responseThis proper Clearly output filter interacting loadPower measurements quite puzzlingNotice pull back due protection kicking likely power supply rather amplifier I could remotely get power rating specify using medium gain I thought maybe low gain better pull back occurred even low power Beside lack power distortion also quite high price class category We talking poor AudioVideo Receiver amplifier performanceSwitching 8 ohm tamed output bit power shortfall still significantThis second amplifier I recently tested power shortfall I started doubt instrumentation So I pulled Purifi reference design measured It tracked dashed line graph year ago 100 Someone posted website600 watts per channel Into 8 ohm This spec manualHow earth measure 600 watts spec 200 watts Strangely graph nowhere found site There talk larger amplifier shrunk version Maybe one produced higher power say mini title graphFYI amplifier green board I understand newer design Maybe older red one power Hard sayAnyway I tried run max burst powerIn Burst mode amplifier would keep going pull back I could compute anything Likewise THDN vs frequency power could run As frequencies got lower lower point amp would pull back would also shrink lower lower wattages What I could get show great transfer functionConclusionsWhile I leave door ever slightly ajar interaction Audio Precision measurements seem indicate amplifier design issues inability meet specifications The fact company took away measurement graph makes suspect maybe modified design selling something different originally intended As waste GaN technology brings nothing party high expenseI cant recommend Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 amplifier
