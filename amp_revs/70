0, Performance Centaur Monos  for an hour at onethird its specified maximum power of 500W into 8 ohms thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage The amplifier was too heavy for me to lift it onto my test bench so it sat on the carpeted floor with some clearance given by supporting it on Black Diamond cones By the end of the hour the top panel was warm at 105°F  and the sidemounted heatsinks were warmer at 1145°F  With the amplifier cold the THDN at onethird power was 00329 By the end of the hour it had dropped to 00307 on serial number 1101131901 using Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  connected to the Centaurs balanced input I repeated some of the tests using the unbalanced input but did not test the amplifier via its Direct input which is intended for use only with Constellation preamplifiersThe voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was a little lower than average at 258dB but close to the specified 26dB It was the same for both balanced and unbalanced drive and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  The Centaurs input impedance is specified as a very high 100k ohms unbalanced and 200k ohms balanced but my measurements were very much lower 96k ohms unbalanced and 19k ohms balancedThe output impedance was low for a bridged design at 007 ohm including the cable at low and middle frequencies rising slightly to just under 01 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the modification of the Centaurs frequency response by the interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker  was less than ±01dB However this graph reveals that the Centaurs ultrasonic behavior depends on the load impedance With the highest impedance I tried 16 ohms  the output rose by 08dB at 200kHz The rise was 03dB into 8 ohms  and into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  the response increasingly rolled off above the audioband Perhaps correlating with this rise at 200kHz while the Centaurs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave had very short risetimes  there was also a very small amount of overshoot visible with one damped cycle of ringing at a very high ultrasonic frequency The 1kHz squarewave reproduction  was essentially perfectFig1 Constellation Performance Centaur frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Constellation Performance Centaur smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsAlthough MF noted that the Centaur was very quiet the amplifiers wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  taken with the balanced input shorted was slightly disappointing at 721dB though it did improve to 812dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the amplifiers lowfrequency noise floor while it reproduced a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms  indicated that the residual fullwave rectified powersupply component at 120Hz lay at –83dB  with the 240Hz harmonic at –87dB The magnetically sourced component at 60Hz lay at –93dB and all the other supplyrelated components lay at or below –95dB I repeated the spectral analysis with the other sample of the Centaur SN 1101131902 The spectrum of this amplifiers noisefloor  was very similar to that of the first sample  but the odd harmonics of the 60Hz AC frequency were a little higher in levelFig3 Constellation Performance Centaur spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms samples 1101130901  and 1101131902  Fig4 which plots the percentage of THDnoise against output power into 8 ohms indicates that the Centaur slightly exceeds its specified 500W into this load clipping  at 520W  The minimum THDN is very low at 00033 the downward slope of the trace below 20W in this graph reveals that the distortion is actually below the noise floor at low powers  The picture was similar into 4 ohms  with the clipping power of 830W  slightly greater than the specified 800W The minimum THDN was higher however at 00061 between 10 and 20W The distortion was higher still into 2 ohms  with the amplifier clipping at 1210W  which is 08dB above the specified 1kW into this load However although I switched off the signal generator as soon as the Centaur clipped into 2 ohms the amplifier wouldnt pass a signal after this test Obviously I had broken something Fig4 Constellation Performance Centaur distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Constellation Performance Centaur distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Constellation Performance Centaur distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsBefore this test I plotted how the THDN varied with frequency at a level 18V where I could be sure that I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise The results are shown in fig7 The THD rises slightly at the top of the audioband but is very low into both 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  The amplifier is less comfortable with 2 ohms  however Again to be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise waveform of the THDN residue at a high level 50W into 8 ohms  The distortion at this level was 0005 and was predominantly third harmonic in nature Even at high power 200W into 4 ohms  the subjectively innocuous third harmonic remained the highest in level at –72dB  with the second harmonic at –90dB  and all other harmonics and powersupply–related components at or below –100dB Intermodulation distortion at high power into 4 ohms was also extremely low Fig7 Constellation Performance Centaur THDN  vs frequency at 18V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8 Constellation Performance Centaur 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0005 THDN  distortion and noise

DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 8 ohms Constellation Audios Performance Centaur Mono is a powerhouse of an amplifier capable of delivering very high power with very low distortion into 4 and 8 ohms While it was less comfortable with 2 ohms it will have no problem driving lowimpedance speakers with aplomb Although I broke it with sustained delivery exceeding 1kW into 2 ohms  there isnt a speaker made that would not be the first to expire at this power level Color me impressed Footnote 1 When he received the amplifier back after the review had been published Peter Madnick let me know that an internal fuse had blown that the amplifier wasnt damaged
