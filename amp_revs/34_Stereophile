I dont necessary equipment test Krell components currentmode operation Therefore I performed technical tests using conventional voltagemode drive balanced unbalanced operationWith volume control set 151 Evolution 202 preamplifier offered maximum voltage gains 118dB full balanced mode 575dB unbalanced mode Both modes preserved absolute polarity ie noninverting The volume controls unitygain setting 101 balanced operation 124 unbalanced The unbalanced input impedance usefully high 38k ohms bass midrange dropping slightly inconsequentially 33k ohms 20kHz The balanced input impedance exactly twice unbalanced expected The output impedance low 45 ohms balanced 225 ohms unbalancedThe Evolution 202 offered wide bandwidth response quarter dB 200kHz This didnt vary volumecontrol setting load impedance identical balanced unbalanced modes There small rise output infrasonic frequencies presumably function DC servo DC offset negligible Channel separation superb better 110dB 5kHz 198kHz volume control set maximum Note however slight peaks 180Hz 300Hz graph possibly due magnetic coupling power supply placed directly preamp chassis testing due short umbilical cable Even levels spuriae way low audible though reduce worstcase unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio still good 822dB Aweighting increased figure superb 957dBFig1 Krell Evolution 202 balanced frequency response 1V 100k 600 ohms Fig2 Krell Evolution 202 channel separation balanced unbalanced modes The Krell preamp could swing high output voltages even low impedances Fig3 reveals balanced output didnt clip 100k ohms 16V RMS unbalanced output clipping 8V These figures significantly higher required drive Evolution 600 power amplifier clipping More important see graph actual distortion remains noise floor 4V 2V suggests preamps gain architecture sensibly optimized I plotted balanced THD percentage frequency 4V level suggested fig3 difference preamps behavior across audioband THD remained low even punishing 600 ohm load Fig3 Krell Evolution 202 THDN vs 1kHz output voltage balanced 100k ohms 600 ohms unbalanced 100k 10k 1k 600 ohmsFig4 Krell Evolution 202 balanced THDN vs frequency 4V 100k 600 ohms And even low level distortion spectral content distortion benign second third harmonics rising residual level signal generator Intermodulation distortion also low Fig5 Krell Evolution 202 unbalanced spectrum 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz 1V 8k ohms Fig6 Krell Evolution 202 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz 1V peak 8k ohms Evolution 600 power amplifier running 200W 8 ohms hour At end period THDnoise percentage dropped 00159 00064 internally housed heatsinks hot touch The chassis around 55°C rear cooler toward front Like Evolution 202 Evolution 600 monoblock measured voltage mode Its voltage gain little lower average 2525dB meaning needs almost 4V RMS balanced unbalanced inputs driven maximum output power It preserved absolute polarity input impedance high 90k ohms unbalanced 200k ohms balancedMy measurement 600s output impedance 0124 ohm higher specified figure My measurement include 6 cable though account small fraction difference But still low enough modification amplifiers frequency response interaction impedance loudspeaker negligible ±01dB This graph also reveals power amplifier wide smallsignal bandwidth though wide Evolution 202 preamplifier The –3dB point lay 116kHz verywelldefined 10kHz squarewave result The bandwidth decrease slightly 2 ohms balanced unbalanced driveFig7 Krell Evolution 600 frequency response 283V simulated loudspeaker load 8 4 2 ohms Fig8 Krell Evolution 600 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave 8 ohmsFig9 reveals Evolution 600 powerhouse clipping continuous drive 610W 8 ohms 1190W 4 ohms 22kW 2 ohms I dont hold AC wall voltage constant tests 1258V amplifier quiescent dropped 1218V amplifier clipping 4 ohms 119V clipping 2 ohms With SN ratio 817dB improving 923dB Aweighted Evolution 600 offers superbly wide dynamic range well exceeds 16bit CD mediumFig9 Krell Evolution 600 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 8 4 2 ohmsI plotted 600s THDN percentage frequency 11V output level indicated fig9 distortion harmonics begin rise noise floor Even fig10 reveals though percentage rise decreasing load impedance remains low constant frequency audio frequencies And 202 preamplifier harmonic content 600s distortion remains low order almost entirely second thirdharmonic nature ACsupply spuriae visible even high powers Intermodulation distortion also low even almost 800W 4 ohms Fig10 Krell Evolution 600 THDN vs frequency 11V 8 4 2 ohmsFig11 Krell Evolution 600 1kHz waveform 200W 8 ohms 00065 THDN distortion noise waveform fundamental notched Fig12 Krell Evolution 600 spectrum 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz 213W 8 ohms Fig13 Krell Evolution 600 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz 790W peak 4 ohms Having test bench recent months number shall I say idiosyncratically engineered products pleasure measure wellengineered pair components Krell Evolution 202 600
