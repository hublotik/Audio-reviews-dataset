0, Lamm M12 Reference I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before testing one of the monoblocks I ran it at 13 its rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage The outputstage bias switch was set to 1–6 ohms which was how I had found the amplifier to sound best At the end of that period the chassis was hot with a temperature of 1096°F  and the heatsinks a little hotter at 1111°F  However as the Lamms output stage is richly biased into classA it behaves somewhat differently from a classAB design after an hour of running at idle the chassis and heatsinks were only a couple of degrees  cooler These temperatures are lower than with our 2004 samples however I had performed the 2004 testing with the higherimpedance bias setting and twice the powerThe voltage gain was higher than usual at 316dB with both balanced and unbalanced inputs and at both bias settings and both inputs preserved absolute polarity the balanced XLR being connected with pin 2 hot and the unbalanced input being connected to the positive RCA jack and the negative shorted to ground as suggested in the manual The unbalanced input impedance was 39k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping inconsequentially to 27k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was twice these values as expectedThe output impedance at the 1–6 ohms setting was 015 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 018 ohm at 20kHz At the 8–16 ohms setting the impedances were 017 and 02 ohm respectively These figures are a little lower than with our 2004 sample and also quite low in absolute terms meaning that the variation of the M12s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was also low at ±015dB  The Lamm has a wide smallsignal bandwidth the response into 8 ohms  not reaching –3dB until 165kHz which gives its reduction of a 10kHz squarewave short risetimes  Commendably neither this graph or the 1kHz squarewave  shows any trace of overshoot or ringingFig1 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsPerhaps due to the its higherthannormal gain the original Lamms signalnoise ratio was good rather than great at 722dB ref 1W into 8 ohms  The 2012 sample was slightly noisier at 682dB which was not affected by experimenting with the ground connections between the amplifier and the Audio Precision even when I floated the signal generators output and ran a separate ground wire to the terminal post on the M12s rear panel Switching in an Aweighting filter increased this figure to 77dB Although in my listening Id heard no noise problems unless I pressed my ear against the speaker I investigated further Fig4 shows an FFT analysis of the M12s lowfrequency noise floor while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms A series of 60Hzspaced components can be seen between –77 and –90dB these obviously stemming from the power supply and most likely due to magnetic interference from the large transformer that lies underneath the smallsignal circuitryFig4 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Biased for 1–6 ohms operation the M12 Reference clipped at 95W into 8 ohms  and 173W into 4 ohms  the latter well above its specified power of 110W into 4 ohms  The 8–16 ohms clipping powers were 180W into 8 ohms  and 295W into 4 ohms  The gentle rise in the THDnoise percentage between the point where actual distortion emerges from the noise floor  and where actual waveform clipping begins suggests that only a modest amount of loop negative feedback is used in the M12Fig5 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Lamm M12 Reference 8–16 ohms distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsI plotted how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at an output level  where I could be sure that I was examining actual distortion rather than noise Even so the THD didnt change at all with frequency and actually decreased slightly into lower impedances  which suggests that the M12 Reference has a wide openloop bandwidth In addition the distortion at low power is predominantly second harmonic in nature  something that always makes an amplifier more listenable The third harmonic begins to dominate at high powers and currents with some higherorder harmonics evident  but this should have no subjective consequences The M12s good linearity at high frequencies means that even at a level close to clipping the intermodulation products resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones remain at or below –66dB  Fig7 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms THDN  vs frequency at 895V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  004 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 127W into 4 ohms Fig10 Lamm M12 Reference 1–6 ohms HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 128W peak into 4 ohms Overall though there are some differences in detail these measurements are not substantially different from those I found with our 2004 sample of the M12 Reference which suggests both excellent consistency in manufacturing and highquality audio engineering
