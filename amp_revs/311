0, Pyle PT8000CH 8channel or 8zone distribution power amplifier It was kindly drop shipped by  costs US 269 Member purchased it for just 158 on saleYou probably cant tell from the picture but this is a massive box It weighs over 50 pounds23 kilograms and is quite deep Rack mounts are provided and needed for both front and back A review says the back holes dont align right however Back panel shows why this amplifier is also tailored for multiroom distributionBy selecting bus mode a single input is distributed to any number of channels from 1 to 8 In mono or stereo Trim pots are provided to adjust the gain for each channel although there were kind of too sensitive to set accuratelyThe side panels gave me paus until I powered the unitI feared that those fans would make huge amount of noise but to my pleasant surprise they barely move and are essentially silent They never sped up or got louder during testing This is far better solution than my pro amps I test with loud and small fans that are not even temperature sensitiveBack to the front the power switch is quite bright  and bleeds into the LED bar graphs But once the unit is on the LED bar graphs themselves light up and more or less cover that issue The power switch feels quite solidPyle as a brand is know for cheap  so my expectations were not high going into the review The overall construction though with dual toroidal transformers in front portrayed a different picture Lets see how it measuresPyle PT8000CH MeasurementsI stayed with stereo measurements for this section selecting the channels 7 and 8 that are next to the AC power input Warm up allowed the amp to improve a bitHere is our dashboardWe have a spray of harmonic distortion that sinks SINAD fairly lowZooming inWe see that the company that it keeps is not too bad SNR falls inline or perhaps a bit betterMultitone is as we would expect from the dashboardFrequency response is good although I wished for a bit more bandwidth as to get a flatter response to 20 kHzCrosstalk though was surprisingly poorLets see how much power we have into 2 channelsBenefit of large power supply comes in when just driving in stereoHere is 8 ohm performance Finally here is power vs frequencyHere is onoff noiseI hooked up the amplifier to an infinity R253 speaker and I could hear a faint pop on power up Power off seemed silent although the fan noise may have masked thatMultichannel Amplifier TestingMy analyzer is only stereo but I drove all channels with the same 8 ohm load Here is the output power in stereo and 8 channelsWe are meeting spec here which is good All the testing so far has been resistive Lets make the load reactive by 30 and 60 degrees angle and also sweep down to 2 ohm and see what happensThis is quite robust At both 4 and 8 ohms the amp doesnt care if the load is reactive or not At 2 ohm though it starts to complain dropping its output voltage by nearly half Testing at 1 ohm resulted in momentary shutdownConclusionsThe build quality of this 8channel amplifier seems quite substantial Massive power supply courtesy of dual toroidal transformers powers the 8 channels well allowing the amplifier to meet spec Distortion and noise are rather high though and rank well below our average The amplifier protection and ability to handle complex loads is excellent You are paying almost nothing for this amplifier  yet you get way above a broken design The PT8000CH wont be my main choice for a highperformance 2channel system but for surround duty and certainly multiroom amplification it seems fineI am going to recommend the Pyle PT8000CH Not because it has great measured performance as far as noise and distortion But that it delivers way way above its cost pointEdit teardown is now posted always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
