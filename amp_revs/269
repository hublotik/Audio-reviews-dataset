0, Schiit Vidar stereo amplifier The Vidar costs US 699 and nicely comes with a five  year warranty With amplifiers being one of the most susceptible audio products to failure long warranty is a real valueThe Vidar sports the usual design style of Schiit which in this form factor is attractiveDespite its narrow width the Vidar is quite heavy as it uses a linear power supply and class AB amplification topologyBack panel connectors are fine but I always miss balanced inputs in audio productsDuring power testing and such the Vidar got fairly warm but not too hot and typical of the category It only shut down once when I ran a sweep causing it to clip at 20 kHzI only tested the unit in stereo mode and not bridgedAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone delivering 5 watts into 4 ohm loadWe see the typical power supply noise spikes to the left and right of our tone SINAD  is dominated by second harmonic distortion though which rises to 80 dB or so in the worse channel As it is performance is a few notches above average of some 85 amplifiers tested to dateSignal to noise ratio and crosstalk follow the same rankingFrequency response is excellent thoughAmplifier Power MeasurementsMost important aspect of an amplifier is amount of power it can deliver cleanly Lets start with 4 ohm loadWe are getting 183 watts which is a bit shy of the 200 watt specification But that is at higher distortion If we allow that we get there as wellUnlike class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies class AB amps like Vidar have much higher peak performance for short duration as you see above rightUsing 8 ohm load we actually beat the company specFinally the difficult test of power versus distortion versus frequencyNice to see these lines without any strange curves and overlap This indicates there are no hidden dragons in the design of Vidar just a standard degradation with frequencyConclusionsSeems that Schiit set up to design a straightforward Class AB amplifier with lots of powers and no design flaws In that regard it succeeds You have an attractive amplifier with long warranty and lots of power into 4 ohm load At US 699 it is priced wellOverall I am happy to recommend the Schiit Vidar
