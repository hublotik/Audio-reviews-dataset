0, March Audio P502 class D amplifier based on Hypex  modules It was kindly send to me by a member for testing The P502 costs US 1075 from the company directThis is not a review because the March Audio is a long time member of the forum and I like to avoid conflict of interestThe unit comes in attractive aluminum packagingOn off control is a touch button which is unusual in power amplifiersHere is a shot of the backIn hard use the bottom plate gets quite warm Make sure you have plenty of ventilation from below A taller set of feet would help with thisMy heavy stress test of frequency versus power caused the unit to shut down momentarily I did not retry it as I dont want to risk damaging the unitWarm Up TestAs is my standard practice now I warm up and measure distortion and noise until the device stabilizes For amps I do this at 5 watts Here are the resultsAs you see the channel in red is having a harder time showing fair bit worse performance than the other It did improve momentarily after power up but then went back to the same state I checked all of my cabling and it was all secure So dont know if this is an assembly issue or sample to sample variationAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboardPer warm up test we see one channel with higher noise floor and differing distortion products Averaging the two channels still puts the P502 well above average amplifierFrequency response was essentially flat in audible band with a resistive dummy load or my speaker simulatorCrosstalk was good enough and predictable32tone test simulating music shows that 1 kHz is actually the point of higher distortion Below and above performance improvesSignal to noise ratio is quite goodExcept for the one channel lagging behind We are talking about 16 bits at 5 watts reaching up to nearly 20 bits at full powerAmplifier Power MeasurementsLets start with 4 ohm loadThat is a ton of power with very low distortion Letting the distortion go up to 1 gets us even moreSwitching to 8 ohm load we getConclusionsLots and lots of power in above average performance and small package If you are going to drive a sub with it at full power you may want to deploy more coolingventilation on the bottom
