0, Carver M15t vintage stereo amplifier It was kindly sent to me by a memberThe M15t came in an era where rack mounting meant serious business As a Carver  owner myself I remember all the advertising for the M15t Oddly there is no power switch anywhereI got a chuckle seeing that monster cable tagAnd found the power specs ridiculously complicated but I am sure was appreciated by the aficionadas of the ampThe front LEDs dont light up until it is putting out a lot of power I liked the top LED which was the limiting lights and nice protection circuit which kept the unit on no matter what This amp was part of Carver Magnetic Field amplification line which varied the power supply voltage to substantially reduce the size and weight of the transformer As a result the unit ran quite cool maybe a bit warmer than modern class D but still impressive for the timeThe owner has replaced the capacitors in this unit Otherwise I think it is untouchedCarver M15t MeasurementsI can see why there is no power switch as the amp did not stabilize for the 14 minutes I measured itThe level of instability is quite large going beyond 10 db variation in SINAD I am used to seeing 1 or 2 dB but nothing at this levelWhen I had the unit connected and before I fed it signal I could see constant switching noiseNot sure what that is about Here is our dashboard at 5 watts with 1 kHz toneThird harmonic dominates distortion profile and with it SINAD  Average SINAD of 55 dB for both channels is far far below that median for all amplifiers I have tested to date  On top of distortion we have massive pulse train which oddly starts at 40 Hz So definitely not very cleanSNR though was betterFrequency response was nice flat and extendedCrosstalk was OKMultitone shows more than usual increase in distortion vs frequencyFront of the unit says it has low feedback which is likely responsible for thisClaim to fame is lots of power so lets see how it doesWe see a distinct jump in distortion at around 66 watts which must be when it switches to higher power supply voltage Allowing for copious amount of distortion there is good bit of power at 273 watts Here is the same at 8 ohmNow lets test peak performanceThere definitely is a lot of headroom allowing power to almost double The 600 watt number and such must have been at higher distortion levels than what I allowTesting for frequency sensitivity we again see the higher distortion at higher frequencies20 Hz performance also dropped with rising distortion at just 20 wattsFinally here is the ultrasonic spectrumConclusionsIt is nice to test products that were iconic during my youth with state of the art measurements that didnt even exist then Using that we see that in noise and distortion the M15t is outgunned by vast number of amplifiers today However it produces copious amount of power which would have been even more impressive then The efficiency rivals class D amps today which was unheard of at the timeLooking online I see that nonupgraded but working units go for 500 or so They seem to be a decent alternative to pro class D amp if you have a soft spot in your heart for vintage amplifiers
