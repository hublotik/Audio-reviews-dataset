Carver Raven 350 tube monoblock amplifier costs US 4750The 350 bad looking amp It orange peel paint job previous Carver 275 amplifier I reviewed At 42 pounds unit pretty heavy With weight back front handle kind useless comes lifting itThere XLR input I believe convenience performs RCA DC resistance 4 8 ohm terminals realized Here I switching back forth Anyway measured DC resistance 047 ohm The 12 ohm tap lower DC resistance 03 ohmUnlike 275 amplifier fuses blow amp survived sweep tests Bias set 80 front dial case I powered unitThere gain control advised set max I testingThere flip switch front changes amount feedback amp settingsHere specsCarver 350 MeasurementsLets start highfeedback performance using XLR inputThere copious amount distortion causing SINAD dominated At 441 ranks second worst amplifier ever testedIt even performed worse Carver 275 SINAD 46 Switching lower feedback doesnt make things much worseNote gain reduced therefore volume different This makes AB testing tricky Here detailed FFT showing small difference low high feedbackNotice distortion made 2nd 3rd harmonics cant make argument 2nd harmonic goodnessAs noted RCA performance XLRPower supply 60 Hz noise cases causes severe intermodulation higher frequency No amount grounding impacted endemic tot designNoise performance decent type amp isIntermodulation distortion rears ugly head multitone testI dont know anyone could hear detail amp much music signal get lost distortion grassFrequency response flat notIt naturally load dependency due output impedanceLets see power situation serious shortfall 275 ampWe dont meet spec come closer 8 ohmBack 4 ohm 1 THD max burst powerWe seem get shortfall There momentary reservoir though allowing peak output shoot way This always consistent thoughI also tested 2 ohm capabilityYou still current limited powerChanging test frequency gives us following power curvesThere instability 20 Hz fairly significant power drop This points power supply enough capacity lower frequency taxes longer period Some drop occurs every amplifier way matter muchFinally amplifier warms quickly pretty stableTesting occurred warm upConclusionsWhat upside world audio Folks want pay much get dirtier sound You want dirty The Carver 350 gives Even 5 watts copious amount harmonic distortion Power supply mixes high level creates spread distortion A video must come amps hypnotizes thinking getting great soundI cant recommend Carver 350 monoblock amplifier
