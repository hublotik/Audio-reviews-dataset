0, The VPA was warmed up for approximately 15 minutes prior to any measurements being taken according to Nagra the amplifier should enter stable operation after this period All measurements were made in balanced mode The 8 ohm  from the 8 ohm outputs 4 and 2 ohm measurements from the 4 ohm outputs The Nagras input impedance is too high  to measure accurately on our Audio Precision test set The two voltages required to produce the measurement differed by mere thousandths of a volt  Suffice it to say that this amplifiers input impedance should cause no matching problems with any competent preamplifier Pin 2 of the balanced input is wired as positive The VPAs voltage gain into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm tap is a high 357dB The measured output impedance was quite high varying between 223 and 226 ohms depending on frequency and load impedance  This suggests some potential frequencyresponse irregularities with typical loudspeaker loads The Nagras DC offset was unmeasurable SignalNoise Ratio  measured 662dB with a bandwidth of 22Hz to 22kHz 662dB from 10Hz to 500kHz and 80dB Aweighted  Fig1 shows the VPAs frequency response The variations into our simulated real load indicate the sort of frequencyresponse variations this amplifier will produce into an actual loudspeaker though the exact variations will depend on the particular loudspeaker The 10kHz squarewave response is shown in fig2—a very good result The Nagra has a good rise time with little rounding of the waveforms leading edge The 1kHz squarewave  is nearly perfect  Fig1 Nagra VPA frequency response into  1W into 8 ohms 8 ohm tap 2W into 4 ohms 4 ohm tap and 2828V into simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohm tap   Fig2 Nagra VPA smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms 8 ohm tap The lowpower THDnoise vs frequency results shown in fig3 are not exceptional While the midband linearity is excellent the amplifier becomes increasingly nonlinear at the frequency extremes particularly below 100Hz—when you use no feedback increased distortion is the consequence you must accept The waveform of the distortion  is shown in fig4 At 1W the waveform was difficult to see in the noise but at 5W a dominant second harmonic is apparent as well as clear signs of higherorder distortion Into 2 ohms  the dominant harmonic changes from second to third  Fig3 Nagra VPA THDnoise vs frequency at  4W into 2 ohms 4 ohm tap 2W into 4 ohms 4 ohm tap 1W into 8 ohms 8 ohm tap and 283V into simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohm tap  Fig4 Nagra VPA 1kHz waveform at 5W into 4 ohms  4 ohm tap distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  Fig5 shows the Nagras output spectrum reproducing a 50Hz sinewave at 41W into 4 ohms The distortion again is fairly high—a maximum of 43dB  at 100Hz with a regularly descending series of higher harmonics Fig6 shows the intermodulation distortion resulting from a combined 1920kHz signal at 307W output into 4 ohms—a level just below visible signs of clipping with this test signal The highest artifact here at 18kHz is 439dB or about 07 There is also approximately 05 distortion at 1kHz  The results are not significantly different into 8 ohms   Fig5 Nagra VPA spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz at 41W into 4 ohms 4 ohm tap   Fig6 Nagra VPA HF intermodulation spectrum DC22kHz 1920kHz at 307W into 4 ohms 4 ohm tap  The THDnoise percentage vs output power curves for 1kHz are shown in fig7 The actual discreteclippingpoint measurements  are 599W  into an 8 ohm load 612W  into 4 ohms and 681W  into 2 ohms  Fig7 Nagra VPA distortion  vs continuous output power into  8 ohms 8 ohm tap 4 ohms and 2 ohms 4 ohm tap It wasnt possible to measure the VPAs toneburst power with the Miller Audio Research Amplifier Profiler its floating output configuration was not happy with the test systems groundreferenced input The Nagra VPAs measured performance reflects its lowfeedback design In short acceptable but little more I feel—Thomas J Norton
