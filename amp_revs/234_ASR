NAD 7050 integrated DAC amplifier streaming playback It appears product announced 2014 since discontinued I cant find sale anywhere The cost USD 999 I gatherThe unit used horizontally vertically A rotational sensor changes display orientation conveniently Here upright position I consider better sound since electrons naturally free fall speaker terminalsThe outside appears sort rubber glued It soft touch picks dirt easily impossible clean due sticky nature itThe large knobs imply great feel dont They wobble rotate The larger knob volume control odd delay updating display rotated Overall good effort made create unusual design didnt quite get feel functionalityThe back panel shows inputs speaker outputFor testing I focused USB input I suspect common interface consumers Alas USB interface class one goes 96 kHz To get advertised 192 kHz need use inputs I downloaded NAD drivers nicely gave ASIO interface testingThere app control I downloaded Android play store It simple remote control allowed change audioout full range I could use DAC testing Otherwise filtered subwoofer Despite simplicity app crashed onceThere analog input I testing USB digital interfaceAs expected brand name company NAD 7050 comes full set safety emissions regulatory certificationsThe amplification NAD 7050 apparently scaled version NAD M2 Here NAD says itMy read power DAC similar Lyngdorf TDAI3400 I reviewed recently Measurements confirm soDAC MeasurementsAs usual possible I try isolate performance subsystems case DAC Here dashboard view using USB inputLine Out I hope sitting owan 7050 use DACWhat heck going Even 0 dB unit doesnt get 2 volts yet severely clips resulting harmonic distortions Dialing 2 dBFS improved performance 83 dB By output voltage even lower making useful DAC anyway My thinking split output power amplifier opposed traditional DAC output I guess assumed subwoofer duty may OKNaturally SINAD measured falls bottom graph DACs testedAfter first bad impression 7050 almost nails rest measurements linearityAnd jitterSince USB doesnt support 192 kHz I run different multitone test 441 kHzAmplifier MeasurementsAs usual dashboard view 5 watts power 4 ohmAs power amplifier measurements go bad actually almost matches vaguely stated 90 dB spec NADPower versus distortionnoise also pretty decentThe downward part curve always dominate noise output level low Here part curve flatter I used seeing good far level noise Likewise distortion kept complete control onset sudden massive clipping 54 watts This good Stated rating 50 watts 4 ohm beating bit nice Then 50 watts much power grand scheme thingsTHDN versus frequency using default 45 kHz bandwidth shows pretty awful results Suspecting ultrasonic noise play I reran test 224 kHz blue shows effect quite conclusively One channel worse though strange Note drop Khz due bandwidth test low capture harmonics Broadband FFT shows 1 kHz tone shows us going onThis without Audio Precision highfrequency filter All tests used filterOn extreme left see 1 kHz tone spike rising 0 dB We single large spike 850 kHz That seems indicate 850 kHz may switching frequency Given high frequency power DAC running likely single bit converter would create lot quantization noise Noise shaping used push 30 kHz peak 80 kHz This drawback power DACs seen Lyngdorf SONOS Amp versus class D amplification doesnt need noise shaping You see effect high frequency noise thickened sine wave signal insetConclusionsUsually time I get end testing I good idea I like dont like device Here I quite sure Lets agree one using NAD 7050 DAC external amplification NAD suggests manual You listening heap distortion products anemic output bootThe amplifier seems good tricks sleeves lower normal noise controlled distortion hard limit My issue 50 watt rating 1000 device That enough power product categorySeeing NAD 7050 discontinued maybe doesnt need recommendation lack thereof anyway So I leave
