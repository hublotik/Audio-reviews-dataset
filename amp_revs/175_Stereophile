I used system examine Octave Jubilee Mono SEs measured performance I followed instructions manual check bias eight output tubes running amplifier 30 minutes allow operating conditions stabilize The pots allow bias tube optimized somewhat coarse action The best I could arrange bias tubes lie 1005 1025 indicated digital meter amplifiers top panelThe Octave Jubilee Mono SE preserved absolute polarity ie noninverting balanced singleended inputs The voltage gain 1kHz 29dB 8 ohms inputs inconsequentially lower specified 30dB The balanced input impedance high 51k ohms audio frequencies The singleended input impedance even higher 74k ohms 20Hz 71k ohms 1kHz 52k ohms 20kHzOctave doesnt specify output impedance Jubilee Mono SEs single output transformer tap I measured 2 ohms low middle frequencies rising 45 ohms top audioband The variation smallsignal frequency response Jubilee Mono standard simulated loudspeaker ±12dB audible The amplifiers response 16 ohms gently rose 10kHz rolling 39kHz The increase output impedance top octave meant response increasingly rolled load impedance reduced Into 2 ohms example output 4dB 20kHz A slight peak 70kHz seen response traces correlated small amount welldamped ringing Jubilee Monos reproduction 10kHz squarewave 8 ohms Fig1 Octave Jubilee Mono SE frequency response 283V simulated loudspeaker load 16 ohms 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig2 Octave Jubilee Mono SE smallsignal 10kHz squarewave 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio good measuring 732dB This ratio improved excellent 905dB measurement bandwidth restricted 22Hz–22kHz 967dB Aweighted Spectral analysis lowfrequency noisefloor Octave amplifier driving 1kHz tone 1Wpc 8 ohms revealed ACrelated spuriae low levelFig3 Octave Jubilee Mono SE spectrum 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz 1W 8 ohms The Octave Jubilee Mono SEs maximum power specified 400W 4 ohms With usual definition clipping—when THDnoise reaches 1—I measured clipping power 175W 16 ohms 295W 8 ohms 68W 4 ohms Relaxing definition clipping 3 THDN Jubilee Mono clipped 380W 4 ohms shy full rated power In Jubilee Monos manual Octave says minimum recommended load impedance 2 ohms maximum power load amplifier reached 3 THDN 88W I also examined power delivery changed I switched amplifier lowbias mode indicated bias LED top panel turning blue green However THDN much higher low distortion low powers seen figs5 6Fig4 Octave Jubilee Mono SE distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 16 ohmsFig5 Octave Jubilee Mono SE distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 8 ohmsFig6 Octave Jubilee Mono SE distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 4 ohmsFig7 Octave Jubilee Mono SE distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 2 ohmsFig8 shows percentage THDN varies frequency 16 8 4 2 ohms 5V Other usual rise top audio octave due limited openloop bandwidth THDN impressively low 16 ohms However rose halving load impedance close 1 2 ohms Fig8 Octave Jubilee Mono SE THDN vs frequency 5V 16 ohms 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms The Octaves distortion signature 8 ohms predominantly comprised second third harmonics I recently received email veteran English engineer Ben Duncan told found correlation smoothness amplifiers THDN waveform sound quality The spikier waveform less sound quality preferred listeners By criterion even though second third harmonics Jubilee Mono SEs output lie close –60dB relative absence higherorder harmonics result good sound quality Fig9 Octave Jubilee Mono SE 1kHz waveform 10W 8 ohms 0122 THDN distortion noise waveform fundamental notched Fig10 Octave Jubilee Mono SE spectrum 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz 10W 8 ohms Duncans finding depends amplifiers harmonic distortion accompanied excessive levels intermodulation distortion The Jubilee Mono SE okay I looked spectrum output drove equal mix 19 20kHz tones 10Wpc 4 ohms The 1kHz difference product lay 70dB peak signal level higherorder products 18 21kHz lay –60dB Fig11 Octave Jubilee Mono SE HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz 10W peak 4 ohms The Octave Jubilee Mono SE offers massive power albeit relatively high levels distortion likely due design decision use modest amount loop negative feedback I commend amplifier low levels distortion moderate powers higher impedances coupled benign distortion signature low levels noise I wouldnt recommend Jubilee Monos use loudspeakers whose impedance drops 4 ohms however Footnote 1 Ben Duncan contributed several technical articles Stereophile
