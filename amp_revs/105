0, LSA VT70  Although potentiometers on the top panel allow the bias currents for the output tubes to be adjusted I understand that these currents are set by the manufacturer before the amplifier leaves the factory Nevertheless before I started the testing I checked the tube bias with the frontpanel meters after a 30minute warmup with no signal and the volume control set to its minimum the bias was very close to an indicated 100 for each tubeThe LSA VT70 preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting from both of its output transformer taps from the headphone output and from the preamplifier output The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the loudspeaker outputs into 8 ohms was 374dB from the 8 ohm tap 3617dB from the 4 ohm output tap The maximum gain from the headphone output was 414dB and from the preamplifier output it was –023dB ie slightly lower than the input level The singleended input impedance is specified as a high 100k ohms I measured a stillhigh 42k ohms at 20Hz 44k ohms at 1kHz and 39k ohms at 20kHzThe preamplifier output impedance was a low 2 ohms at high and middle frequencies though it rose to 265 ohms in the low bass presumably due to the presence of a series coupling capacitor The headphone outputs source impedance was a high 470 ohms across the audioband which means this output will not be optimal for use with lowimpedance headphonesAlthough the VT70s loudspeaker output impedance is specified as 8 ohms or 4 ohms I suspect that these actually refer to the nominal values of the output transformer taps The source impedance of the 8 ohm tap was a very high 51 ohms at low and midrange frequencies rising to 74 ohms at the top of the audioband As expected the impedance was lower from the 4 ohm tap at 27 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 38 ohms at 20kHz The variation in the LSA70 amplifiers smallsignal frequency response from the 8 ohm tap with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was an audible ±24dB From the 4 ohm tap  the variation was smaller at ±175dB but this will still be audible Into resistive loads  the VTA70 started to gently roll off in the top octave with then a sharp dropoff above 45kHzFig1 LSA VT70 8 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig1 taken with the volume control set to its maximum features excellent channel matching The channel gains were less wellmatched at lower settings of the volume control with the right channel almost 1dB higher in level than the left when the control was set to –10dB This difference decreased to 03dB with the control set to –20dBThe VT70s reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  was superbly square which correlates with the extended low frequencies seen in fig1 However the ultrasonic rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  and the small peak just above 40kHz in the frequency response is associated with some ringing on the tops and bottoms of the waveformFig2 LSA VT70 8 ohm tap smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 LSA VT70 8 ohm tap smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe VT70s channel separation  was 60dB in both directions below 2kHz but decreased to 40dB R–L and 46dB L–R at 20kHz The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  was a good 767dB  This ratio improved slightly to 778dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 901dB when Aweighted The SN ratios at the 4 ohm taps were around 15dB greater Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the LSAs 8 ohm tap drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  revealed a low level of random noise and the ACrelated spuriae at 60Hz and its odd and evenorder harmonics lay at or below –80dB This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum Peculiarly with the control set to –20dB the oddorder ACrelated spuriae were all higher in levelFig4 LSA VT70 8 ohm tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum  and to –20dB  LSA specifies the VT70s maximum power as 35Wpc into 8 ohms  which is what I would expect from a pushpull pair of EL34 tubes operated in Ultralinear mode  With our usual definition of clipping—when the THDnoise reaches 1—and with both channels driven I measured a clipping power of just 7Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms  and the same from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  Relaxing the clipping definition to 3 THDN gave output powers of 253Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms  and 2845Wpc from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifier uses a limited amount of loop negative feedback With the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  1 THDN was reached at 195Wpc  and 3 THDN at 27Wpc  More significantly the THDN was lower at low powers than it had been with the load matched to the nominal transformer tapFig5 LSA VT70 8 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 LSA VT70 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 LSA VT70 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig8 shows how the percentage of THDN in both channels varied with frequency from the 4 ohm tap into 8 and 4 ohms at 49V which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms and 6W into 4 ohms The THDN was higher in the right channel  than the left  and as shown in fig7 was lower with the higher load impedance The THD rose at low frequencies due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformer The THDN percentage at the same voltage from the 8 ohm tap  was about 5 times as high as it was from the 4 ohm tapFig8 LSA VT70 4 ohm tap THDN  vs frequency at 49V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion waveform from either tap  suggests that the second harmonic was dominant However at low frequencies the third harmonic was the highest in level  which again will be due to the output transformer Note that the right channels second harmonic in this graph is almost 20dB higher than in the left channel This might have been due to the output tubes bias currents not being sufficiently closely matched in that channel except that these appeared identical when I checked the bias before testing It is more likely therefore that one of the right channels output tubes had aged out of spec  However at the same output voltage at higher frequencies  the second and third harmonics are equally high in level in both channels each close to –60dB Fig9 LSA VT70 8 ohm tap left channel 1kHz waveform at 3W into 8 ohms 018 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 LSA VT70 4 ohm tap spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms Fig11 LSA VT70 4 ohm tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms Despite the relatively high level of harmonic distortion intermodulation distortion was only moderate in level With the VT70s 8 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  the 1kHz difference product lay at –66dB  The higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were only 4dB higher in levelFig12 LSA VT70 8 ohm tap HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms The LSA VT70s measured performance is typical of a conventional tubed design using a pushpull pair of EL34s for its output stage and with only a small amount of loop negative feedback The lowest distortion will be obtained from the 4 ohm output transformer tap especially driving impedances 4 ohms with no significant reduction in maximum power
