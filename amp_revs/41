0, Luxman M10X   amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the grilles over the internal heatsinks were hot at 1206°F  though the top panel was just warm at 909°F  Operating the amplifier for another 30 minutes at onethird the specified power a level that results in the maximum heat dissipation in the output devices increased the temperatures only slightly The M10X has sufficient heatsink capacity for its rated powerThe Luxmans voltage gain is specified as 29dB presumably into 8 ohms which was confirmed by my measurements The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with the unbalanced input and the rearpanel Phase Inversion switch set to Normal However the M10X inverted polarity with the balanced input with the Normal setting of the switch which implies that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 3 positive rather than pin 2 the opposite of the AES convention The balanced input impedance was usefully high at 54k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to 26k ohms at 20kHz The lowerfrequency impedances are almost twice the specified 28k ohms which suggests that the latter refers to the impedance of each signal phase The unbalanced input impedance was 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies rising to the specified 51k ohms at the top of the audiobandThe Luxmans output impedance was a very low 006 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing slightly to 009 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was negligible at ±01dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was down by 3dB just above 100kHz and flat to 20kHz which correlates with the M10Xs superb reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  Commendably there was no overshoot or ringing in the squarewave responseFig1 Luxman M10X frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Luxman M10X smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was close to 90dB in both directions below 2kHz dropping insignificantly to 80dB at the top of the audioband Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was an excellent 83dB ref 1W into 8 ohms  This ratio improved to 938dB when the measurement was Aweighted and to 1156dB when referenced to the amplifiers specified maximum power This is very close to the specification of 117dB  Spuriae at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its harmonics were present in the Luxmans noisefloor  but were negligible at close to –100dB ref 1W into 8 ohmsFig3 Luxman M10X spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms In stereo mode—I didnt look at the amplifiers behavior in bridgedmono mode—the Luxman M10X is specified as being able to deliver 150Wpc into 8 ohms and 300W into 4 ohms  With both channels driven and using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the Luxman exceeded its specified powers clipping with a 1kHz signal at 202W into 8 ohms  and at 350W into 4 ohms  At 1W into 8 ohms the frontpanel meters indicated –25dB ref 0dB and at 50W into 8 ohms they indicated –9dBFig4 Luxman M10X distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Luxman M10X distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe shape of the traces in figs4 and 5 suggests that the measured THDN percentage below 20W is dominated by noise I therefore examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms The THDN was very low in the bass and midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  then rising at higher frequencies more so into 4 ohms  than into 8 ohms  Nevertheless the THDN only reached the specified 004 with 20kHz at 100W into 4 ohmsFig6 Luxman M10X THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The Luxmans distortion was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  with the third harmonic a little lower in level  This spectrum was taken with the amplifier driving 50Wpc into 8 ohms the second harmonic in the left channel lay at a low –103dB  With a 1kHz signal at 100Wpc into 4 ohms it rose to a still very low –90dB  When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 8 ohms  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –100dB  with higherorder intermodulation products close to the same level At the same voltage into 4 ohms these distortion products only rose slightly in levelFig7 Luxman M10X 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0002 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Luxman M10X spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at
