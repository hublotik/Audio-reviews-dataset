0, Audio Research Corporation  1002 stereo power amplifier The 1002 came out in year 1998 at a cost of US 2995 It was later raised to US 3495 If I remember correctly the owner told me this the last solid state amplifier ARC produces before going to all tube routeThe 1002 is as solid as a rockThe back panel is as you expect with the exception of  speaker binding postsIn use the 1002 cooked and cooked good I measured 45 to 47 degrees C on the heatsinks The internal temps are likely much higher I read that it uses unobtanium output MOSFET transistors so if they go you likely have a giant door stop  In use though the 1002 did not complain one bit and ran through all of my testsStrangely when you power the unit down it takes it a while to do that What it is doing I dont knowThe design of the unit is based on low feedback factor of just 6 dB Based on that alone I can tell you it is not going to perform wellAmplifier Audio MeasurementsWe have huge power supply peaks like due to poor power supply rejection ratio of low feedback design Second and third harmonic dominate the distortion profile resulting in lackluster SINAD of just 65 dB That lands the ARC 1002 near the bottom of some 72 amplifiers tested so farFrequency response is excellentResponse changes some with a simulated 2way speaker load but nothing to cry overMultitone test shows the high distortion products of the power supplyAnd rather high noise floor which we can directly measure using signal to noise ratioCrosstalk shape is odd but not an audible concernAmplifier Power MeasurementsThe sins of low feedback factor stare at you in the face with our 4 ohm loadYes distortion gradually increases but then it clips anyway So why not have clean power until clippingSame deal into 8 ohmsAt least it slightly exceeds its power specificationsStrangely burst power  doesnt generate much more powerKeeping THDN constant at 01 gives us incredibly low and strange amount of powerThere is so much distortion and noise in the output of this amp that you dont get much power if you set your goal at 01 THD  FYI I ran the above at 02 THDN  and it produced about 80 watts with a straight line Anyway who says only class D amps have trouble with this testAmplifier Thermal stabilityI powered the unit cold and let it run nearly half hour while recording distortion and noise This is what I gotThat is very high degree of improvement Again low feedback means that it is more sensitive to operating temperature Given the high heat dissipation it is a tough deal to have to also keep the unit on for a while to get the best performanceConclusionsSigh The best analogy I can think of here is if car owners said you know a car should have more square tires and manufacturers running to build cars that way Yes audio folklore says feedback is a bad thing Well I have news for you distortion is really really bad thing As is noise It surely doesnt give you blacker background if it has higher noise does itI read some place that it has less feedback so it can deliver less phase shift Do folks not know that you have reflections in your room every one of which arrives at your ears with a different delay and hence phase That they all mix up and as a result the brain discards that info If it did not we would go crazy trying to make sense of people talking to us in indoor situations Anyway we digressNeedless to say I cannot recommend the ARC 1002 Serviceability will be poor and so will the performance
