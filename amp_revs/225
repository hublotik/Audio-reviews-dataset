0, Schiit Aegir stereo Power  amplifier  a member who has been patiently waiting since August for its review The Aegir is sold direct by Schiit and costs US 799 plus shippingThe Aegir is very heavy substantial and serious looking piece of audio gear in blackWhat I dont like is the extra sharp edges of the heatsinks on each side where you naturally want to grab it But I understand extruded aluminum comes this way and having the corners marchined would be expensiveHere is the back panelAt first I was super excited to see the XLR input but became puzzled why a stereo amp only has one of them Then I realized that it is only for driving the unit in bridged mode So for most of my testing I used RCA and then used XLR for bridged power testingI cant quite tell what type of amplifier this is from technical terms Schiit uses They seem to want to say this is mostly a class A amplifier but then it isnt at higher power Anyway the Aegir runs warm but not too hot so whatever trick they are using to lower power consumption of this unit versus pure class A is workingThe Aegir is a new design which was introduced in 2018 I see Audio Precision measurements for it which means it is part of the new design philosophy to take measurements and design verification seriouslyAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard feeding a 1 kHz tone into the amp aiming for 5 watt output into 4 ohmStarting on the left side the gain of 20 dB is on the low side Then again the output power is so low  that you dont need a lot of gain to get to maximum powerSINAD  which is a positive dB version of THDN mathematically  puts the Aegir in respectable above average ranking of all power amplifiers testedWe see good bit of power supply spikes which I verified to also exist in Schiit AP measurements Levels are below 100 dB so likely not audible due to our poor sensitivity in low frequenciesFrequency response is ruler flat in audible bandSignal to noise ratio is good matching what we need for 16 bit audio playbackMultitone test tells us intermodulation between 32 tones fed to the amplifierOnce again we see that we clear the 16 bit threshold of CD musicMost important test is power versus THDN Lets see that for 8 ohmSchiit rates this amp at 20 watts into 4 ohm so we are close Likely they allow 1 distortion versus my standard of onset of clippingWhat is puzzling is 4 ohm outputWe are long ways away from 40 watts Then again the clipping tilts to the right some so I suppose if you walked up that curve far enough you get to 40 watts You would get good bit of distortion though so 40 watts is a marketing numberNote that one channel is more unhappy than the other I confirmed that exists just as well in Schiit measurements So likely power is fed is less efficiently to one amp than the other Or there are grounding component mismatch etcTo test bridged mode I fed the Aegir vial XLR balanced connection and got thisI only get 23 watts of usable power which is hardly more than 195 watts I got in stereo mode The curve tilts to the right more now so marketing department went to town there to spec the 80 watt number Measuring dynamic power which uses 1 number Schiit uses we do get much more powerSo with real music you likely have more power than my continuous tone tests indicateLets test how sensitive the Aegir is to input frequencySort of a classic output in that lower frequencies limit the amount of power available  but also have lower distortion I was asked to add multitone test to my amplifier measurements I usually use that for DACs since there it is a lossless signal To use it for amplifiers the signal has to be converted from PCM to analog which invokes the DAC in the AP That would put a limit on how good of a measurement I can make For amps like Aegir is not a limitation though so here it isWe see the general distortion floor is around 100 bits or 17 bits However there are some earlier spikes due to power supply noise Again our hearing is not very sensitive in that region so they can be ignoredConclusionsThe Schiit Aegir is a competently designed amplifier with solid build quality and no design mistakes It shows the power of proper measurements and engineering verification to remove the element of surprise in thirdparty verification job we perform hereThe main issue here is lack of power To someone like me with very large spaces rather inefficient speakers and desire for bass that you feel as much as you here the Aegir is definitely not for me Nor do I buy into Class A having any benefit If it had it would show up in measurements It does notIf have efficient speakers andor dont listen very loud the Aegir is a solid offering from a western company I am going to put the Schiit Aegir on my recommended list for its solid engineering and design Fitness for application is up to you
