0, Luxman L509X    I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time the Luxmans top panel was warm at 95°F  and the small metal grilles above the heatsinks were hotter at 1077°F Looking first at the line inputs The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum measured 434dB for both balanced and unbalanced signals The meters on the amplifiers front panel appear to be calibrated so that –20dB corresponds to just over 1W into 8 ohms With the rearpanel switch set to Normal the balanced inputs inverted absolute polarity meaning that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 3 hot which the manual confirms The polarity can be changed to pin 2 hot with the switch The unbalanced inputs preserved absolute polarity  The unbalanced input impedance was a relatively high 47k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz decreasing slightly at 20kHz to a stillhigh 36k ohms The balanced input impedance was 52k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHzThe headphone output impedance was very high at 800 ohms at all audio frequencies As the maximum gain at this output was the same as at the speaker terminals I suspect that the headphone output is implemented by placing a resistor in series with the poweramplifier stage The output impedance at the speaker terminals was a very low 0075 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 011 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the modulation of the L509Xs frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was less than ±01dB  This graph was taken with the tone controls defeated and with the volume control set to its maximum commendably there was no change in response at lower volumecontrol settings The Luxmans frequency response is down by 3dB at 100kHz as a result a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with very short risetimes  and there was no overshoot or ringing with a resistive loadFig1 Luxman L509X frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Luxman L509X smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Bass and Treble controls offered maximum cuts and boosts of 9dB but with a slight difference between the channels  It turned out that when I enabled the tone controls that also activated the Balance control which was slightly favoring the right channel With the Balance control centered channel separation was good rather than great at 75dB in both directions The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was 754dB this improving to a respectable 826dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 857dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor  indicated that all the ACsupply harmonics lay below –95dBFig3 Luxman L509X response of Bass and Treble controls set to their mid and maximum boostcut positions Fig4 Luxman L509X spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Luxman specifies the L509X as offering 120Wpc into 8 ohms  and 220Wpc into 4 ohms  and the amplifier comfortably exceeded its specified power even with both channels driven With clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1 I measured clipping powers of 154Wpc into 8 ohms  and 250Wpc into 4 ohms  The downward slope of the traces in these graphs indicates that the distortion lies beneath the noise floor below 50W or so To be certain I was measuring actual distortion I examined how the THDN percentage varied with frequency at a fairly high level 20V  Even so the THDN was extremely low in the bass and midrange and while there was the usual rise in the treble this was still not to a significant amount Fig5 Luxman L509X distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Luxman L509X distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 Luxman L509X THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The THDN waveform at this level  indicates that the distortion is predominantly secondharmonic in nature this confirmed by spectral analysis  though at high powers into 4 ohms the third harmonic became the highest in level in the left channel  Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones the Luxman produced relatively low levels of intermodulation distortion even at high powers into low impedances  with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –100dB  and the higherorder products at or below –80dB Fig8 Luxman L509X 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00038 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Luxman L509X spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz

phono input offers two modes for movingmagnet and movingcoil cartridges Both modes preserved absolute polarity The gain in MM mode was 795dB measured at the speaker terminals with the volume control set to its maximum and 356dB when measured at the Rec Out jacks In MC mode the gain was 531dB again measured at the Rec Out jacks The MM input impedance was 45k ohms at low and middle frequencies 37k ohms at 20kHz The MC mode impedance was a constant 100 ohms across the audiobandThe RIAA error was low with a slight 04dB bump in the midrange  However the left channel  has a slight boost in the top audio octaves Noise levels were low and in MM mode the unweighted wideband SN ratio was an excellent 69dB ref 1kHz at 5mV this improving to 906dB when Aweighted In MC mode the unweighted wideband SN ratio was a stillgood 65dB Phono overload margins were excellent at 25dB across the audioband in MM mode 30dB in MC mode Harmonic and intermodulation distortion levels via the phono input were also superbly low Fig12 Luxman L509X phono input MM mode RIAA error at 5mV input Fig13 Luxman L509X phono input MM mode spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 5mV input Fig14 Luxman L509X phono input MM mode HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 5mV peak input Its measured performance indicates that Luxmans L509X integrated amplifier is a conservatively engineered design with low noise and distortion and an excellent phono stage
