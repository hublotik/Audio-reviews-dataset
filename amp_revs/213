0, ATI AT522NC Stereo power amplifier The 522NC costs US 2195 but I see it on Amazon for US 1995 The AT522NC is part of a series which starts with 2 channels of class D amplification and goes up to 4 channels in the same enclosureThe industrial design of the AT522NC has some unique touches some of which work some that dontThe part that detracts is ironically the ATI logoThe power button has a very nice feel and gives one impression of qualityLooking at the back I was surprised by choice of input power connectionIt is a 20 amp IEC connection rather than the most common 15 amp variety This is partially due to use of linear power supply and massiveheavy toroidal transformer But the most common reason is that the same setup is used in higher channel count amplificationThe amplifier is on a vertically mounted hypex NC500 class D amplifiers with their own heatsinks The motherboard has the power supply components Overall it seems like a very neat and logical designThe speaker connections are of course very secure and high quality as can be expected in this price range Great to see balanced XLR inputs which is how  unitIn use there was barely a heat rise in the enclosure and the unit never shut down or complain even in the face of severe clipping  The large feet allow better convection cooling which is appreciatedAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone at 5 watt into a 4 ohm loadThe use of linear power supply has its price in the form of power supply spurious tones  The dominant distortion peak is third harmonic at a bit less than 100 dB Add some noise to it and SINAD  becomes around 98 dB This places the ATI522NC well above average of all the amplifiers we have testedIt sits just to the level of NC500 from Nord Those of you who keep track of such things  I am sure will compare and contrast how it does relative to other Hypex based implementationsSignal to noise ratio is good reaching excellence at full powerFrequency response is orderly for a class D amplifier which needs an output filter to truncate switching frequency32tone source trying to simulate music shows very low levels of intermodulation distortionBut for a peak at 60 Hz  the distortionfree range is 110 dB or about 18 bitsCrosstalk is also very goodMost important data is power into 4 and 8 ohm versus distortion and noise So lets start with 4 ohmSo not class leading but low distortion while providing 300 or so watts before sudden rise in distortion Spec is higher but one can have more data points at the limit and gradually walk up the curve and hence squeeze out a few more watts I will show this laterFor 4 ohm load here is the comparison to our stateoftheart in class D amplification in the form of Purifi reference designPurifi maintains the lead in distortion but produces a bit less powerI was able to run my tough test of THDN at 01 versus frequencies Some amplifiers have died trying to run this test Others are had to poinpoint as their distortion jumps all over the placeWe see that at 1 kHz we normally measure power is almost near max Above that we reach nearly 360 watts At 20 kHz though distortion shoots way up and we are able to only produce 22 watts before THDN of 01 is hit Fortunately there is not much music energy there so practical audible concern is lowI made a survey of a few of the tracks in my music library Peak energy seems to hover around 40 Hz For that reason I have started to measure amount of power at 40 Hz and here we have 316 watts which is goodFinishing off switching frequency is around 400 kHzThe noise doesnt scale with power though Plotting the same at max power with source frequency of 40 Hz gives us thisAnd intermodulation distortion using 1920 kHz at 5 watts output into 4 ohmConclusionsThe ATI AT522NC seems like a solidly built amplifier based on Hypex NC500 modules ATI builds amplifiers for many other companies and this competence shows up in this review Performance is of course limited by what the NC500 module can do Use of linear power supply defeats the size and weight advantages of common class D amplifiers It may provide better peak power rating  something I wanted to test but forgot Overall I can recommend the ATI AT522NC stereo amplifier As always questions comments corrections etc are welcomeWatching important news on TV as I type this so no positive energy to think of a lame joke Please donate if you can using
