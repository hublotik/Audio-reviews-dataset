0,I measured Ayre Acoustics EX8 Integrated Hub   ing I updated the firmware over my network and ran the EX8 at onethird power into 8 ohms At the end of that period its top panel was warm at 1071°F  However the bottom panel which acts as the heatsink for the output devices was hot at 1248°F  EX8 owners should make sure the amplifier is well ventilatedLooking first at the linelevel analog inputs With the volume control at its maximum setting the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 26dB from the speaker terminals for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs This is on the low side for an integrated amplifier The maximum gains from the headphone outputs were 94dB balanced and 34dB unbalanced The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  from all outputs The unbalanced input impedance was 18k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping very slightly to 17k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced value as expected These impedances are very much lower than the specified respectively 1M ohm and 2M ohms  but are still high enough not to load down source componentsThe singleended headphone output impedance was a low 37 ohms at all audio frequencies The balanced output impedance was twice this value as expected but still low in absolute terms The output impedance at the speaker terminals  was 045 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz This is relatively high for a solidstate design presumably due to the lack of openloop negative feedback around the output stage and resulted in a modulation of the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker of ±03dB  The response was flat to 20kHz into resistive loads  rolling off above the audioband to reach –3dB above 200kHz Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum the response didnt change at lower volume settings However an imbalance developed in favor of the left channel at lower settings of the volume control reaching a maximum difference of 09dB at –20dB but less at higher and lower settings The Ayres reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  was superbly square with short risetimes but with a very slight but critically damped overshoot visibleFig1 Ayre EX8 analog input

excellent at 100dB in both directions below 2kHz decreasing to 80dB at 20kHz which I assume is due to capacitive coupling between the channels With the analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured 7525dB in the left channel and 738dB in the right both results superb Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 857dB in both channels and an Aweighting filter increased it further to 885dB Levels of residual spuriae at the AC powerline frequency and its harmonics were very low Fig3 Ayre EX8 analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The EX8 is specified to deliver a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive in both channels the Ayre exceeded that spec by 02dB delivering 105Wpc into 8 ohms  With both channels driven into 4 ohms the EX8 clipped at 125W  The distortion was extremely low below 1W into either impedance but rose to 10W or so then decreased slightly before actual waveform clipping occurredFig4 Ayre EX8 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms both channels drivenFig5 Ayre EX8 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms both channels drivenMeasured against frequency at a moderate output level 895V—equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms 20W into 4 ohms and 40W into 2 ohms—the distortion levels were respectably low into the two lower impedances  but the EX8 was less happy driving 2 ohms  The shape of the distortionspuriae waveform indicated the presence of higherorder harmonic products  Spectral analysis indicated that the third harmonic was the highest in level with higher oddorder harmonics present  Secondorder intermodulation distortion at a relatively high power into 8 ohms was very low the product at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at –99dB  Highorder products were present at higher levels and these further increased when I repeated the test into 4 ohmsFig6 Ayre EX8 analog input distortion  vs frequency at 895V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Ayre EX8 analog input 1kHz

input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 20Wpc peak into 8 ohms Turning to the digital inputs the EX8s AESEBU and coaxial and optical SPDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz and preserved absolute polarity Apples USB Prober utility identified the EX8 as Ayre USB Interface from Ayre Acoustics with the serial number Streamlength  USB Prober confirmed that the EX8s USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the EX8s USB port could handle 24bit integer data at all sample rates up to 384kHz A 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in an output level of 1732V into 8 ohms with the volume control at its maximum setting which suggests that the digital inputs have too much gain—ie a digital signal at –7dBFS with the volume control up full will just drive the amplifier into clipping into 8 ohms Using the menu to turn off the speaker outputs I continued testing the digital inputs from the balanced preamplifier outputsThe Ayres impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that its reconstruction filter is a short minimumphase type with a small degree of ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS This impulse response is identical to that of the Listen filter used in the other digital products from Ayre that weve reviewed since the QB9 USB DAC in 2009 With 441kHzsampled white noise  the EX8s response rolled off slowly above the audioband not reaching full stopband suppression until almost an octave above the Nyquist frequency of 2205kHz  An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  is suppressed by only 11dB therefore The distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor the highest in level being the third at –78dB  but these are obscured by other aliasing productsFig10 Ayre EX8 digital input impulse response Fig11 Ayre EX8 digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz When EX8s digital frequency response with SPDIF data at 441 96 and 192kHz the response followed the same basic shape at each sample rate with a slow rolloff that reached –3dB at 20kHz with 441kHz data  With data sampled at 384kHz  the output rolled off in a manner similar to the 192kHz data but reached –9dB at 102kHz rather than at 90kHz The output with 384kHz data was down by 24dB at 192kHz that sample rates Nyquist frequencyFig12 Ayre EX8 digital input frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor dropped by about 15dB meaning that the EX8 offers between 18 and 19 bits worth of resolution With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical  With 24bit data the result was a wellformed sinewave Fig13

digital inputs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit JTest data the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were all at the correct levels  though sidebands at the powersupply–related frequencies of ±120 and ±240Hz can be seen and were also present with 24bit JTest data  These sidebands were accentuated with USB data Fig16 Ayre EX8 HF intermodulation spectrum

the analog and digital domains but I was somewhat concerned by its harmonic distortion signature I do wonder if using the chassis as the heatsink means that the output stage cant be biased too strongly into classA Footnote  This very high specified input impedance was a typo in the manual
