0, of Accuphase E270 Integrated Amplifier  our friends at Gig Harbor Audio It is their demo unit so I have to return it on Tuesday So if you need something else to be measured ask right away The E270 was released in 2017 I think and retails for USD 5000 This is not cheap by our normal standards but in highend audio this is a pretty reasonable priceThe industrial design of the unit seemingly has not changed from 1980s era with beautiful VU meters At 44 pounds the unit is quite heavy for its capabilities There is a massive transformer in the middle of the unit and the power amplifier modules with beefy heatsinks sit on either side During my testing I could not even get the unit to become warm let alone hot It runs so comfortably that one thinks it is never going to stress outThe front has a slick finish that is lovely to touch Volume control is implemented through resistor ladders and hence has electronic control Accuphase says it has 6500 steps which should be plenty for listening although was a bit difficult to dial in the exact value for measurementsThere are slots in the back for optional DAC and phono stage  which mine did not have All in all this is the type of construction look and feel that would justify paying good bit of premium over a budget product Given the likely reliability that comes from a highend product from Japan I say the stage is set for a good impressionNote seeing how this is a demo unit to be sold I did NOT attempt to stress the unit No long term warm up and certainly no stress test Given the overdesigned thermal design here though I am not worried about the measurements holding under thermal stressMeasurementsFor reasons that will become clear later I decided to test the power amplifier section first Accuphase makes this dead easy with a frontpanel button MAIN IN that decouples the power amp input from preamp output This allowed me to test the power amplifier separately and compare its performance to recently tested power amps So lets start with our 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohmI have added two more panels here gain and dc output Have not verified the latter but should be correct As we see there is a 04 dB gain error and variation in distortion level The loads I use are not precision types  so some of this may be instrumentation I did match levels  and distortion levels and differentials remained the same At 92 to 95 dB SINAD we are getting in territory of transparency for CD music The two distortion products are second and third harmonic at around 100 dBSignal to Noise ratio is very good at 116 dBThe E270 is rated at 120 watts and it blows way past that to the tune of 155 watts prior to clipping You can see the comparison to recently reviewed Onkyo M282 The E270 outperforms it in every category from lower noise floor and distortion to more power prior to clipping The Onkyo of course is a budget product at 300 On not so good news the Hypex based NC400 amplifier way outshines the Accuphase E270 It has far less noise distortion and much more power Whoever thinks class AB amplifiers are better than switching ones like NC400 this is the time to cry PreamplifierLets isolate the preamplifier and measure it at unity gain Wow that is quite a bit better than the power amplifier with much lower noise floor and distortion Dont get too excited though There are some really odd things going on here Lets switch inputs to XLRWhat the heck We lost 10 dB of performanceWhat is really really strange is that if I measure RCA but leave the XLR cables connected performance drops way down just the same  You can see it easily in signal to noise ratio measurementsAccuphase hints at much lower performance of XLR input in the specs for the productThis aside note as I have shown on the FFT chart above how we have lots and lots of power supply related spikes This is evident in an FFT of the spectrum Switching power supplies like used in Hypex NC400 amplifier shown in the inset in blue convert mains to DC and then convert it back to AC at hundreds much higher frequency  As a result you are free of mains related noise in good implementations  There is no denying how clean the Hypex NC400 amplifier is in the audible band The Accuphase E270 in contrast while cleaner than budget Onkyo M282 has a ton of noise spikesThe problematic area for switching amplifiers is in the high frequencies so lets look at thatThe levels of noise and spurious tones is of course quite a bit lower than switching amplifiers We once again see that XLR input has worse performance Lets now remeasure the power versus distortion using the E270s preampWe have a repeat of issues with XLR input again Notice the performance of RCA input with  and without XLR  cable connected but not used And of course we leave fair amount of performance on the table with respect to the power amplifier alone It seems that loading the preamp with the power amp reduces its performance substantially I traced this to preamp getting severely distorted when the power amp is under stress There is lack of isolationindependent power supply for the preampStory is the same with intermodulation distortion versus levelInterestingly enough the level sensitivity for XLR is the same as RCA I should be able to swing that to 4 volts for the same output with RCA at 2 voltsFrequency response falls in the category of very good newsI left the levels different for each input so that the graphs dont fall on top of each other The power amplifier  has the flattest response but by just a bit There is really no issue in the audible band to 20 kHzConclusionsOn fit and finish the Accuphase E270 integrated Amplifier delivers for a product in low thousands of dollars It has the nostalgic look of 1980s product which is popular now and certainly different than common mass market products Its power amplifier has respectable and conservative specifications Measurements show it to produce far more power than stated with massive thermal capacity which should spell long service lifeUnfortunately I think there are some serious engineering issues in the preamplifier The XLR input not only generates much worse performance on its own but also serves to pollute the performance of RCA input There is not sufficient powerisolation for the preamp causing its performance to sag when the unit is asked to produce a lot of power These are faults that I dont tolerate in mass market products let alone higher end onesI would say if you want to get an Accuphase product get a power amplifier The integrated unit as tested just doesnt do that job so sadly I cannot recommend itEDIT update the price to the correct one
