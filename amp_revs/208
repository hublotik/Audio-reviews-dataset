0, VTV Purifi classD amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2BA Opamp    costs US 2090 I just reviewed the same amp but with SIL 994EnHTicha Pro buffer so you can compare them As with the other variation I am a fan of the more slim rack mount case Back panel as expectedVTV Purifi classD amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2BA Opamp MeasurementsLets start with our dashboard and see if the power supply noise we had with the SIL buffer also exists here thereby telling us if the problem was that or something elseSadly the issue remains with the noise in the FFT spectrum So something else is at play I tried to mess with grounding to see if it impacts it and it would get much worse At one point one channel got unstable producing variable output Maybe that was instrumentation error but I did not walk away with a good feeling on this Nevertheless overall ranking remains quite high due to stellar performance of Purifi amplifier module itselfI am just going to post the rest of the measurements without text as they are similar as the other reviewWhen I ran the dashboard and saw the same problems with the other VTV amplifier I wanted to rule out instrumentation error So I dug up my Purifi reference design and it produced superbly clean output as it did in my original review While I was at it I also ran this test  and it produced similar output to this VTV amplifier So the choice of buffer doesnt have much impact hereConclusionsWhen I bought my latest car it came with a fine scratch on the instrumentation cluster cover Too lazy to take it back to be repaired To this day it bothers me when I see it even though it doesnt impact anything on the operation of the car Such is the case with this VTV Purifi amplifiers In absolute terms they land way on top of the class But looking carefully we see that something in the assembly and layout has caused performance to degrade objectively It wont impact you in any way listening to it but just like my car it shouldnt be there Smaller companies building these boxes dont do any measurements and hence cant spot problems like this So it is partly understandable but as consumers we get to be ruthless in our demand in best in class execution So I hope the company looks to resolve these problems as their prices are very attractive otherwiseI cant recommend the VTV Purifi amplifiers based on these two versions I have tested
