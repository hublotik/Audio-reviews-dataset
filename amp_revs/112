0, Krell K300i   I usually precondition amplifiers by running them at one third power into 8 ohms for an hour The Krell almost made it turning itself off after 55 minutes with the frontpanel display showing the message Over temperature left channel The top panel over the heatsinks was hot at 1428°F  but cooler over the transformer at 1131°F  This is a tough test for an amplifier with a classAB output stage as onethird power results in the maximum dissipation in the output devices The Krell has just sufficient heatsinking for its power rating but should be given plenty of space for ventilationAfter the K300i had cooled down I was able to continue with the testing Looking first at the linelevel analog inputs the Krells voltage gain into 8 ohms is specified as 25dB referenced to 2V RMS in balanced and full power output  However with the volume control set to its maximum of 100 I measured a gain of 435dB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs into 8 ohms While higher than the specification this gain is typical for an integrated amplifier The gain measured at the unbalanced preamplifier outputs was 2125dB which is on the high sideThe amplifier preserved absolute polarity  for both XLR and RCA inputs at both the loudspeaker and preamplifier outputs The singleended input impedance is specified as 8k ohms the balanced impedance as 16k ohms However my measurements indicated 127k ohms for the unbalanced input impedance but a low 44k ohms ie 2200 ohms per phase for the balanced impedanceThe output impedance is specified as a very low 0035 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz By contrast I measured 0131 ohms at 20Hz 0133 ohms at 1kHz and 0159 ohms at 20kHz these figures including the series impedance of 6 of loudspeaker cable Even so the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by less than ±01dB Fig1 Krell K300i frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  and simulated loudspeaker  The audioband response into impedances of 8 and 4 ohms  is flat up to 20kHz and the two channels match very closely The output into 2 ohms  was down by just 0125dB at 20kHz This graph was taken with the volume control set to 100 Commendably the ultrasonic rolloff didnt vary at lower volumecontrol settings or from the preamplifier outputs The K300i amplifier has a wide smallsignal bandwidth and its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringingFig2 Krell K300i smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 90dB in both directions at 1kHz though it reduced to 67dB R–L and 75dB L–R at 20kHz The wideband unweighted SN ratio ref 283V and measured with the volume control at 100 and the unbalanced input shorted to ground was 63dB  which improved to 765dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 788dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the Krells noise floor  revealed that the random noise level varied with the setting of the volume control suggesting that this was related to the higherthanusual preamplifier gain The spuriae related to the powerline frequency were all very low in level howeverFig3 Krell K300i spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to 80  and 100  The Krells maximum power is specified as 150W into 8 ohms and 300W into 4 ohms both equivalent to 218dBW With clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 I found that the K300i exceeded its specified power clipping at 190W into 8 ohms  and 320W into 4 ohms  Fig7 shows how the Krells THDN percentage varied with frequency at a moderate output level 8975V into 8 4 and 2 ohms Commendably the distortion in the top audio octave is only slightly higher than it is at low frequencies The distortion is predominantly third harmonic in character  though the second harmonic is only slightly lower in level  Highorder intermodulation products with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 40W into 4 ohms were relatively low in level  and the secondorder difference product lay at –86dB Fig4 Krell K300i distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Krell K300i distortion  vs 1kHz

Turning to the digital inputs Apples USB Prober utility identified the Krell amplifier as Krell K300i from KRELL and indicated that the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that via USB the K300i accepted 32bit integer data sampled at all rates from 441 to 384kHz All the digital inputs preserved absolute polarity With the Krells volume control set to its maximum and the level trim set to 0dB a 1kHz digital signal at –30dBFS resulted in a level of 7791mV at the preamplifier outputs but 2023V into 8 ohms from the speaker outputs The latter is equivalent to 51W which is just 47dB below the specified maximum power As often appears to be the case with integrated amplifiers the K300is digital inputs have too much gain I wanted to continue the testing from the preamplifier outputs using the menu to set the output mode set to Fixed Peculiarly however the volume control was still active in this mode To avoid blowing up the Krells output stage with highlevel digital test signals therefore I continued the testing with the volume control set to 53 which gave a level of 20V at the loudspeaker terminalsThe K300is impulse response with 441kHz data was a fairly long minimumphase type with all the ringing following the single high sample  With 441kHzsampled white noise  the Krells response reached full stop band attenuation at 24kHz suppressing the aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  by almost 110dB The harmonics of the 191kHz tone can be seen in this graph with the third the highest in level at –74dB  The K300is frequency responses with data at 441 96 and 192kHz followed the same basic shape but with a sharp rolloff above half of each sample rate Fig10 Krell K300i digital inputs impulse response Fig11 Krell K300i digital inputs wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz Fig12 Krell K300i digital inputs frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the random noise floor dropped by 18dB meaning that the Krells digital inputs offer 19 bits worth of resolution However a lot of lowlevel AC supply–related spuriae can be seen in this graph With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical  With undithered 24bit data the result was a superbly clean sinewave Fig13

–9031dBFS 16bit data Fig15 Krell K300i digital inputs waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit data Intermodulation distortion via the digital inputs was even lower than it was via the analog inputs  with the secondorder difference product produced by equallevel tones at 19 and 20kHz with the combined waveform peaking at 0dBFS lying at –93dB  Finally tested for its rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit USB data all the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency square wave were at the correct levels  However a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz to the sides of the peak that represents the highlevel tone at onequarter the sample rate can be seen these power supplyrelated Repeating the jitter test with TosLink data gave the same result as did using 24bit JTest data Fig16

Krell K300i offers excellent measured performance The only shortfall was the digital inputs very high gain which probably led to the introduction of lowlevel supplyrelated spuriae
