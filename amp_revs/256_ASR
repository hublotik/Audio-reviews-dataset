Living Sound Audio Electronics Voyager GAN 350 stereo amplifier costs US 3000 companyI really like highend look amplifier caseStrange though power indicator switch The latter back onlyI really dislike hard read type back Other connectors seem good qualityAs name indicates amplifier uses GaN transistors ostensibly lower distortion increase efficiency amplification In use bottom modules mounted barely god warm efficiency goodLSA Voyager GAN350 MeasurementsI started testing XLR inputs showed really odd resultsAs see gain nearly 10 dB different channels I looked configuration switches couldnt find anything After wasting half hour I switched RCA input problem vanishedIf I guess I would say XLR input miswired one channel Bad execution expensive amplifier For rest test I stuck RCA inputSignal noise ratio OK state artI like see full 16 bit96 dB dynamic range 5 watts We fall short hereFrequency response sad seeClass D amplifiers low pass filter interact load designed well The impact falls clearly audible band This would OK budget amplifier 100 range class Depending speaker hook amplifier highs may exaggerated filteredCrosstalk hand exceptional due dual mono design crosstalk power supplyMultitone performance also good indicating low intermodulation distortionPower healthy 4 ohm albeit unexceptional distortion noise levelsThere still plenty power available even 8 ohmInteresting distortion keeps rising clipping rather soft As state indicates low amount negative feedbackTransfer function frequency dependent distortion rising quite bit higher frequencies Spectrum switching frequency shows good attenuation high frequencyIf opted higher speed GaN transistors allow impact output filter would lower The amplifier doesnt need warm stable power onConclusionsOther lot power good efficiency much else happy Clearly companies using GaN buzzword without fully taking advantage provide Lots money left table many areas frequency response load dependency high amount distortion At end day expensive high power amplifier average performanceI cant recommend LSA Voyager GAN 350 Performance quality controlEdit teardown posted always questions comments recommendations etc welcomeAny
