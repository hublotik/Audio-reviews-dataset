NAD C 320BEE power amplifier It kind loan The C 320BEE vintage product dating back 2003 I think The BEE designation apparently reference Bjorn Erik Edvardsen one designers Cant tell designed version based work years earlier Either way I told classic I dont keep things I sure set straight isnt From I tell original cost US 399 So quite budget piece midtier brand like NADThe C 320BEE typical NAD design language maintained dayThere set tone controls balance I appreciate day age removed gearI seek manual remain unsure thing powers You hit power button nothing happens press one input buttonsHere back panelIt old school layout nonremovable power cord jumper set pre power map And set RCA jacks lined upThe unit appears run cool large holes bottom amplifier heatsink touch heatsink gets quite hotIn testing without undue stress unit went protection would reset I cooled fan left minutes Most amps survive testing without going protection mode since I push max power secondsAlso process changing setup 4 8 ohm unit went oscillation producing 107 watts signal So instability design This happened I changed load impedance 8 ohm perhaps wont see dont mess speaker output unit onTo safe side last tests I put fan top keep cool got run reliably Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLets start usual 5 watt dashboard 4 ohmThe highest distortion product 100 dB Since SINAD 90 dB means 10 dB noise degrading All else equal noise less audible problem distortion good Take value C 320BEE clocks much better many amplifiers measured regardDrilling 1 kHz tone spectrum see nice clean output classic AB amplifierThose hate classD spectra ultrasonics rejoice Signal noise ratio good power dependentI think spec dBs better I sure mess levels volume control position get Either way plenty clean CD16bit playbackCrosstalk unremarkable compared stateoftheartFortunately audible issue plenty separation channels Frequency response broad quite flat audible bandEven 100 kHz response 1 dB So highresolution music sing without amplifier truncating bandwidthLets look intermodulation distortion versus power outputThis wellbehaved amplifier gets limit clips hard amplifiers tend Of note soft clip light I see come testsWe run test two high frequency tones 19 20 kHzForgetting ultrasonic ones around 38 kHz distortion sidebands remain 100 dB nice You play 16 bit content without worrying distortion noise floorMost important test power versus distortion Lets start 4 ohm loadThis modest level power strangeness response We run test compare modern streaming amplifiers todayWe clean power compared less power compared either SONOS Amazon Link Amp The NAD outperform NuForce STA200 though every respect Switching 8 ohm gets us thisI puzzled power output remains identical cases Something must controlling thatThe graph distortion versus frequency power levels quite messy typically isPutting aside light pink near clipping amp well behaved modest rise distortion power levels increaseTo keep things exciting I added new measurement test It dynamic power according CEA2006490A designed keep car audio amplifier companies honest peak powerThese burst power measurements Let know like I run future reviews I think merit measuring way music continuous sine waveConclusionsNice go back time test amplifiers simple understand simple measure The NAD C 320BEE seems competently designed modest power delivery budget price In regard completely succeeds missionPersonally I think 67 watts enough home listening Todays speakers become smaller size shrunk efficiency needing fair bit power get produce proper dynamics If disagree otherwise sensitive speakers NAD C 320BEE seems good unit buy It certainly away anxiety may using classD amplification
