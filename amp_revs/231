0, NAD C 320BEE power  amplifier It is on kind loan The C 320BEE is a vintage product dating back to 2003 I think The BEE designation is apparently a reference to Bjorn Erik Edvardsen who was one of their designers Cant tell if he designed this version or this is based on work he did years earlier Either way I am told it is a classic I dont keep up with such things but I am sure some of you will set me straight if that is or isnt so From what I can tell the original cost was US 399 So quite a budget piece for a midtier brand like NADThe C 320BEE is typical of NAD design language which is maintained to this dayThere are set of tone controls and balance which I appreciate in this day and age when it is removed from most gearI did not seek out the manual and remain unsure how this thing powers on You hit the power button but nothing happens until you press one of the input buttonsHere is the back panelIt is an old school layout with nonremovable power cord jumper set for pre to power map And a set of RCA jacks lined upThe unit appears to run cool but there are large holes on the bottom where the amplifier heatsink is and if you touch that heatsink it gets quite hotIn testing without undue stress the unit went into protection and would not reset until I cooled it off with a fan and left it off for a few minutes Most amps survive my testing without going into protection mode since I only push them to max power for secondsAlso in the process of changing my setup for 4 to 8 ohm the unit went into oscillation producing 107 watts on its own with no signal So there is some instability in the design This happened when I changed my load impedance to 8 ohm so perhaps you wont see it if you dont mess with speaker output while the unit is onTo be on the safe side for the last few tests I put a fan on top to keep it cool and that got it to run very reliably Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLets start with our usual 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohmThe highest distortion product is at 100 dB Since out SINAD  is only 90 dB it means there is 10 dB of noise that is degrading that All else being equal noise is less of an audible problem than distortion so that is good Take at its value the C 320BEE clocks much better than many other amplifiers we have measured in this regardDrilling into the 1 kHz tone spectrum we see the nice clean output of classic AB amplifierThose of you who hate classD spectra in ultrasonics can rejoice now Signal to noise ratio is good but is power dependentI think the spec is a few dBs better than this but I am sure you can mess with levels and volume control position to get there Either way this is plenty clean for CD16bit playbackCrosstalk is unremarkable compared to stateoftheartFortunately this should not be an audible issue as there is plenty of separation between channels here Frequency response is broad and quite flat in audible bandEven at 100 kHz the response is only down 1 dB So your highresolution music can sing without the amplifier truncating their bandwidthLets look at intermodulation distortion  versus power outputThis is a wellbehaved amplifier until it gets to its limit and then clips hard as amplifiers tend to do Of note there is a soft clip light but I did not see it come on in any of my testsWe can run the same test but with two high frequency tones of 19 and 20 kHzForgetting about the ultrasonic ones around 38 kHz the distortion sidebands remain at 100 dB which is very nice You can play your 16 bit content without worrying about any distortion above its noise floorMost important test is power versus distortion Lets start with 4 ohm loadThis is very modest level of power but no strangeness in its response We can run the test again but compare to modern streaming amplifiers of todayWe have very clean power compared to them but less power as compared to either SONOS or Amazon Link Amp The NAD does outperform the NuForce STA200 though in every respect Switching to 8 ohm gets us thisI am puzzled that power output remains identical in both cases Something must be controlling thatThe graph of distortion versus frequency at power levels is quite messy as it typically isPutting aside the light pink which is at or near clipping the amp if well behaved with only a modest rise in distortion as power levels increaseTo keep things exciting  I added a new measurement to this test It is the dynamic power according to CEA2006490A designed to keep car audio amplifier companies honest with peak powerThese are burst power measurements Let me know if you like them and I will run them in future reviews I think there is some merit to measuring this way as music is not continuous sine waveConclusionsNice to go back in time and test amplifiers which were simple to understand and simple to measure The NAD C 320BEE seems to have been competently designed for modest power delivery at a budget price In that regard it completely succeeds in its missionPersonally I think 67 watts is not enough for home listening Todays speakers have become smaller in size and shrunk in efficiency needing fair bit of power to get them to produce proper dynamics If you disagree otherwise or have sensitive speakers the NAD C 320BEE seems to be a good unit to buy It certainly does away with any anxiety you may have with using classD amplification
