0, Karan POWERa Mono amplifiers that JVS auditioned serial number 005 Because the amplifier was too wide to fit through the door from my listening room to the corridor that leads to the test lab I performed the measurements in my listening room To ensure that this very powerful amplifier wasnt starved of wall current I ran two long heavyduty extension cords to the Karan from the 20A circuit in the test lab  amplifier  plugged into one of the extension cords Following distributor Wynn Wongs recommendation I performed the measurements with the DC filter on the amplifiers rear panel switched on however I didnt measure any differences with this filter on or off  Other than voltage gain polarity and input impedance all the measurements were performed using the balanced input When testing the singleended input I followed the manuals recommendation of shorting pins 1 and 3 of the XLR jackOut of its crate the amplifier was icecold from its air trip from Washington State so I ran the Karan at a few watts into 8 ohms for two hours before examining its measured performance I then followed the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power of 21kW  into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the ventilation holes on the top panel over the internal heatsinks were very hot at 1244°F  The side panels were even hotter at 1446°F  However when I repeated some of the tests the next day without the preconditioning I noted that amplifier ran very cool to the touch even after driving 1W into 8 ohms for an hourThe POWERa Monos voltage gain was 347dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs which is higher than usual The Karan preserved absolute polarity  with both input types  The specified input impedance is 30k ohms for both input types I measured 296k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz for the balanced input half that value for the unbalanced inputFig1 Karan POWERa Mono frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Karan POWERa Mono smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Karans output impedance was 05 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing to 067 ohm at 20kHz  These impedances are higher than I expected from a solid state design presumably because the output comprises two amplifier stages in series a topology used to obtain the POWERas very high specified power The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was ±025dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was down by 3dB at 81kHz a lower frequency than the specified –3dB at 300kHz The increased output impedance at 20kHz means that the –3dB frequency was somewhat lower into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  However the POWERa Monos reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  was superb with no overshoot or ringingFig3 Karan POWERa Mono spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Measured with either the unbalanced input or the balanced input shorted to ground the Karan amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was a very good 718dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to 79dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 813dB when Aweighted While evenorder harmonics of the 60Hz powersupply frequency were present in the Karans noisefloor  these were very low in level at –94dB and below ref 1W into 8 ohmsFig4 Karan POWERa Mono distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Karan POWERa Mono distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsWhen  POWERa Monos maximum power into 8 ohms the THDnoise reached 1  at 185kW into 8 ohms  While this is lower than the specified 21kW into this load  the AC wall voltage had dropped from 1206V with the amplifier idling to 1145V with the amplifier clipping The Karans maximum power into 4 ohms is specified as 36kW  I measured 25kW into 4 ohms at 1 THDN  Again the wall voltage had dropped by several volts at the clipping power  I didnt test the maximum power into 2 ohms because this would have tripped the wall supplys circuit breakerFig6 Karan POWERa Mono THDN  vs frequency at 1267V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Figs4  5 indicate that actual distortion lies beneath the noisefloor below 1W rising to a maximum around 20W then dropping again reaching a minimum value just before actual waveform clipping I therefore examined how the percentage of THDN changed with frequency at 1267V which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms 40W into 4 ohms and 80W into 2 ohms  The distortion remained below 01 into all three impedances and was lowest in level at low frequencies into 2 ohms  Commendably the distortion doesnt rise at high frequenciesFig7 Karan POWERa Mono 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms 0051 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Karan POWERa Mono spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms I was having some issues with my digital oscilloscope at very high sample rates so fig7 shows my analog oscilloscopes screen with the POWERa Mono driving 1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms This photo reveals that the distortion at high powers occurs at the waveforms zerocrossing points This will be due to the output stage lacking sufficient bias at this power perhaps as a result of the sliding bias mechanism While the third harmonic is the highest in level at –66dB  the crossover distortion is as always accompanied by higher oddorder harmonicsFig9 Karan POWERa Mono HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms When the POWERa Mono drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 100W into 8 ohms  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –106dB  though higherorder intermodulation products are higher in level These products dropped by around 3dB at the same peak voltage level into 4 ohmsThe Karan POWERa Mono amplifiers measured behavior reveals that it copes well with low impedance and offers extremely high power though the level of distortion at moderately high powers was not as low as I was expecting Footnote 1 Observant folks will notice that even though its below the amplifiers specified maximum power 25kW is more power than a single 120V 20A service should be able to supply But the Audio Precisions procedure raises the input voltage quickly before terminating the input signal the moment the distortion reaches a preestablished target in this case 3 It takes a while for a circuit breaker to trip so presumably the current from the wall exceeded 20A momentarily—too briefly to trip the breaker—Jim Austin
