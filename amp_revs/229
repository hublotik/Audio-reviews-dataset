0, Yamaha RN803 Receiver amplifier and streamer It was purchased by a member  and drop shipped to me The RN803 costs US 750 from amazon including Prime shippingThe RN803 has AVstyle features such as Room EQ but with only two channels of amplification It has a retro look which is quite a bit nicer than an AVR thoughAlas beauty is only skin deep Those nice vertical controls are loose and have nowhere near the great feel of the 1970s gear with their solid mechanical selectors The back panel shows how the video features have been stripped awayAs a package it is much more appealing than the monster size of typical AVR So not a bad effortInternally there are decent size heat sinks one for each channel This is a huge step up from a shared flimsy heat sinks we see in modern AVRs with many channels This resulted in high robustness as in my testing nothing caused the RN803 to shut down or go into protection mode With AVRs it is common for them to do these things even though I still drive them with just two channelsReceiver Amplifier TestingI exclusively used the CD input for my testing There is a button for Pure Direct as there is on AVRs so lets engage that and see what we getI set the volume control to 3 db to get the nominal 29 dB of gain Measurements were not that different at 0 dB I had to play fair bit to get rid of some ground loops  Once there I was rewarded with pretty good SINAD which is a combined measure of distortion and noiseAs you see the ranking is way above average of just 77 dB SINADSwitching off pure direct mode however causes severe performance dropNoise floor as moved massively up and distortion has increased Now we are back in the poor category of AVRs Sadly to use Room EQ you need to operate in this mode so you have a tough decision of whether you want to have low noisedistortion or room EQDynamic range in pure mode is goodAs is crosstalkFrequency response is excellent in pure mode as wellTurning off pure  causes a sharp drop near 50 kHz which seems to indicate the input is digitized using 96 kHz sampling It is nice that this rate is a lot higher than many AVRs use Not so nice is the nonflat response even though I set all the controls to the middleThere is plenty of power into 4 ohm load at lower distortion and noise than a number of AVRsSwitching to 8 ohm load and measuring pure and nonpure modes shows the poor performance of the latterI had a slight issue with this test Just minor wiggling of the speaker terminals caused one channel to get distorted much earlier Not sure what is going on with thatBack to 4 ohm load we see that we have plenty of headroom for momentary peaks in musicAnd here is our power test with different frequenciesAt low frequencies approaching 20 Hz distortion rises above 60 watts or so  Otherwise this is a predictable performance with high frequencies being a bit more distorted than low And this is a good thing compared to nasty curves with get in some switching amplifiersConclusionsAs a pure analog integrated amplifier the Yamaha RN803 does well It produces ample amount of power into 4 ohm with pretty low distortion and noise The visuals are also quite attractive Digital mode to use such things as AutoEQfilters is rather poor due to similar issues in many AVRs Sad that Yamaha did not go the extra mile and produce a better subsystem hereI personally dont like to use an AVR as a stereo setup due to their large size and not so pretty face plate So in that regard I appreciate the Yamaha RN803Given the good pure analog mode performance and nice looks I am going to put the Yamaha RN803 on my recommended list
