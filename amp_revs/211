0, NAD M27 7channel surround audio amplifier Seems like the M27 came out back in 2014 and costs US 4400The M27 has the same design language as the excellent M17 Home Theater Processor The enclosure especially the top surfaces oozes quality and luxury in the way that many highend audio companies fail at And the looks are actually functional with ample ventilation holes for proper cooling I will do a teardown later to show this in more detailOne strange bit of functionality is that the NAD logo lights up orange but goes off when the amplifier is turned on using the touch button on top This is backwards but fits the functionality for home theater use in darkened roomThe rear panel takes the high quality look of the front and top to the backEverything from XLR connectors to speaker terminals is stout and feels solidIn use the amplifier when driven in two channel mode never came remotely close to complaining shutting down etc which I frequently see in AVRsHeat dissipation at first is very modest but after half hour of use the idle power consumption of the rest of the unused channels served to warm up the top No worries though as it was not remotely hot This is due to use of switching power supply  and class D amplifiers based on design from Hypex nCore series The actual implementation is custom which I will show in teardownFor my testing I focused on XLR input only I hope if you buy an amplifier of this class that is the connection you usePower Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard driving two channels into 4 ohm at 5 wattsAh what a relief it is to see excellent SINAD  in home theater space after testing so many subpar amplifiers in AVRs Distortion products are around 110 dB Ironically this is far better than the processor and AVR DACs we have tested In 2channel world our desktop class are usually way ahead of amplifiers but not in home theater So far anywayThe very nice showing in noise and distortion puts the M27 amplifier near top of the classSpectrum of 1 kHz FFT shows the typical switching frequency in 400 kHzHere is the frequency responseThere is a kink in there around 50 kHz but seeing how it is way out there as far as audiblity it should be OK May differ though with a real speaker loadCrosstalk is very goodDynamic range at around rated power is excellent Even at rated power you have 105 dB or 175 bitsMost important test is THDN  relative to power level as we increase input Here it is at 4 ohmWow this is one powerful beast in stereo mode Courtesy of a power supply that is designed to feed 7 channels it is not a bottleneck in 2channel mode allowing these class d modules to sing And sing loud8 Ohm output is also quite goodOf course in neither case we are able to match the stateoftheart 2channel amplifiers from likes of Benchmark or Purifi But what is there at 90 dB or better should be quite excellentPeak power as you can imagine is even higherHere is a refined version of a recent test I sweep for power using different frequencies from 20 kHz on down to just 20 Hz Test bandwidth is 45 kHz so that it allows enough harmonics to be included in the test but not too much that it just shows ultrasonic noiseshaping and suchAs expected at low frequencies we have lowest distortion  but we clip due to much larger power demand of these slow wavesConclusionsThe NAD M27 surround power amplifier has exceptional looks and build quality It is beautiful to look at That beauty runs way deep into its veins producing lots of power in a classleading way Efficiency of classd power amplifier and switching power supplies serve to keep the unit quite cool for its power rating and number of channels Great attention has gone into heat management and signal flow  something I dont normally see in DIY hypex ncore buildsYes at US 4400 it is not cheap but you are getting 7 channels of amplifications That is roughly 630channel which is actually quite competitiveI am happy to give the NAD M27 one of my highest recommendationsIf you have a home theater and want a gorgeous powerful and performant multichannel amplifier your search is over Get the M27 and worry about money for food later
