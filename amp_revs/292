0, upgraded TPA3221 chip based AIYIMA A05 integrated amplifier   costs US 80 from Amazon including Prime shippingFor a budget amplifier the controls feel niceAs you see tone controls are provided Alas there is no detent or switch for flat response If you center them you actually get too much bass I had to adjust them using iterative measurements to settings you see in the picture above for flat response A giant external power supply providing 32 volts is included which dwarfs the size of the unit itselfI dislike these little speaker terminals but they are very common in this price class They are too close to each other to connect beefy locking banana connectors I use for testingBluetooth is provided which I did not testIn use the unit never even got warm so efficiency must be quite high Or else the heat is not transmitted to the caseAIYIMA A05 MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboardSINAD is dominated by distortion and ranks below average of all the amplifiers tested to dateStill for this price and category I think this is pretty goodSignal to noise ratio becomes good at full powerCrosstalk is decent as wellHere is our frequency response with my adjustments of the tone controlAs you see we get a typical peaking of the response when I change impedance to 8 ohm This is due to the filter in the class D amplifier interacting with the load Fortunately you have tone controls here so you can compensate for itMultitone shows best performance in mid frequencies which is a good thing compared to the alternativeLets see how much power the A05 can produce into 4 ohm loadThis is much more than I expected We get decent amount of power even with 8 ohmAbove is with 1 kHz Lets see how it does when we vary thatNot pretty at either high frequencies or very low As noted mid frequencies do well which is good as that is where we are most sensitive ConclusionsGetting decent amount of power and low distortion and noise is hard in ultra low price category but the AIYIMA A05 gets there So I decided to grade it on a curve and give it my recommendation
