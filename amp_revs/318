0, Fosi Audio BT10A Bluetooth Class D stereo amplifier The B10A seems to have just been updated with tone controls and sells for US 50 from Amazon with free prime shippingThis is a very small amplifierYou cant see the depth but it is quite shallow Other amps like this I have tested have complicated interface to change builtin digital tone controls There are none here so it was easy to useThe back connectors is identical to what you see on myriad of such ampsWhile the external laptop replacement power supply is large compared to the size of the unit it is not as huge as some others Note that it comes with a threeprong figure8 AC socket so you have less options to replace the cordI did not bother testing the Bluetooth I am assuming it autoselects it if in range as the priority input as there is no switch to select itSpeaker terminals are tiny of course but I managed to plug in my heavy and large banana jacks into itAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain Second harmonic dominates to the tune of 65 dB which sets the SINAD to the same value This says that noise is not a contributor to SINAD and as such any gain setting would have produced similar SINAD The 65 dB SINAD value doesnt put a smile on anyones face but it is a couple of steps above 30 units Noise figures are barely adequate32tone test signal shows more or less uniform distortion at all frequencies1920 kHz tones shows 55 dB of distortionfree rangeTheir full  amplitude shows higher distortions than multitone test doesFrequency response shows truncated low and high frequenciesAbove with a resistor load Subjective the amp to my new complex speaker model of a 2way speaker generatesThe speaker model has a its impedance shooting up in high frequencies causing similar issue here There is a question of whether the model is similar to mass of 2way speakers so dont run with this yet What you can conclude is that the speaker choice does impact the speaker response In audible band though the impact is minimal and in some way is correcting the dip toward 20 kHz A good amp would have no speaker load dependencyLets see how much power the BT10A can produce into 4 ohm loadAt 33 watts with both channels driven this is good bit of power Similar story with 8 ohm loadLack of power is by far the 1 issue in these amplifiers You may not be able to hear their noise and distortions but you absolutely will hear them complain when they clip At these power levels you should have a reasonable experience unlike some other budget amps that stop at 10 watts or soAllowing for more distortion  and testing with a shortterm sinewave and long term produces identical numbersThe input power supply is regulated so there is no reservoir to provide shortterm juice Thermal StabilityPerformance gradually improved by a 2 dB or so after 30 minutes of playing at 5 wattsAbove tests were performed after this warmup periodConclusionsThe Fosi Audio BT10A doesnt seem half bad I am not going to provide a verdict one way or the other You can decide for yourself if the performance is good enough for your application
