0, Rogue Audio Sphinx using my topoftheline  system   the Sphinx for an hour at onethird its specified maximum power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms Thermally this is the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage but its irrelevant with an efficient classD amplifier like the Rogue which uses the wellregarded Hypex modules By the end of that period the Sphinxs chassis was only mildly warm but at least I could be confident that the circuits were all nicely toasted for testingLooking first at the line inputs the maximum gain into 8 ohms was 3116dB with excellent matching of the two channels The Sphinx preserved absolute polarity  and its input impedance was usefully high at well above 100k ohms at almost all audio frequencies and still 103k ohms at 20kHz The output impedance was very low for a classD design at around 002 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz  rising slightly to 011 ohm at 20kHz As a result the variation in frequency response with the Sphinx driving our standard simulated loudspeaker  was negligible Unusually for a classD design the Rogues ultrasonic rolloff was identical into loads ranging from 2 to 8 ohms There is usually a passive lowpass filter between the classD output stage and the speaker terminals to reduce the level of ultrasonic switching noise and this filter will misbehave into loads other than the one it was optimized for The Sphinx offered no such misbehaviorFig1 Rogue Sphinx volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Present in the Rogues output however was around 225mV of ultrasonic noise with a center frequency of 4155kHz in the left channel and 4185kHz in the right This can be graphically seen in the waveform of a 10kHz squarewave  For all the measurements other than this one I used a precision passive lowpass filter from Audio Precision to eliminate noise above 200kHz that would otherwise contaminate the analyzers reading Repeating the squarewave measurement with this filter gave the waveform shown in fig3—the risetimes are slowed by the amount you would expect from the response in fig1 and though there is a small degree of overshoot on the waveforms leading edges this is critically damped with no ringingFig2 Rogue Sphinx smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Rogue Sphinx smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision lowpass filterChannel separation  was good rather than great at 60dB in both directions below 1kHz and around 40dB at the top of the audioband The unweighted signalnoise ratio in the audioband taken with the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum was moderately good at 672dB left and 633dB right This was primarily due to fullwave–rectified supplyrelated spuriae which were a little higher in the right channel  I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the analyzer this was the spectrum I took with the optimal arrangementFig4 Rogue Sphinx spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with Audio Precision lowpass filter The Sphinx precisely met its specification of maximum power into 8 ohms 100Wpc or 20dBW at 1 THDnoise  with very low distortion between 1 and 20W Into 4 ohms the amplifier clipped at 155Wpc or 189dBW  but with a little higher distortion at lower powers Plotting the THDN percentage at 87V into 8 and 4 ohms  a voltage where I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise indicated that the left channel  was a little more linear than the right  Neither channel changed its behavior with frequency other than above 10kHz where I assume the limited ultrasonic bandwidth is affecting the resultFig5 Rogue Sphinx distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms with Audio Precision lowpass filterFig6 Rogue Sphinx distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms with Audio Precision lowpass filterFig7 Rogue Sphinx THDN  vs frequency with Audio Precision lowpass filter at 89V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion result is heavily secondharmonic in nature though there must be higherorder products present into lower impedances giving rise to lowlevel peaks that are slightly displaced in time from the waveforms zero crossings  This can also be seen in fig9 which shows the spectrum of the Sphinxs output with a 50Hz tone driven at 40 power into 4 ohms However intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at the same power into 4 ohms is respectably low  The secondorder product at 1kHz lies at –64dB Fig8 Rogue Sphinx 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms with Audio Precision lowpass

I could keep the output stage quiescent These outputs operate at unity gain for linelevel inputs for the phono input I measured a voltage gain of 377dB which is appropriate for movingmagnet cartridges and highoutput movingcoils The input preserved absolute polarity and the input impedance was 41k ohms at 20Hz and 20kHz rising slightly to 46k ohms at 1kHz Again these figures are appropriate for MMs and highoutput MCsThe RIAA correction was superbly accurate for what must be a relatively inexpensive circuit with very little error and the two channels matching to within 01dB  The bass rolls off early conforming to the IEC modification of the RIAA specification and reaching –3dB at 11Hz Channel separation via the phono input was excellent at 80dB in both directions at 1kHz The phono inputs noise performance was also excellent with unweighted audioband signalnoise ratios  of 773dB left and 798dB right The ratios improved by 6dB when AweightedFig11 Rogue Sphinx phono input response with RIAA correction  With its relatively low gain the Sphinxs phono input offered superb overload margins ranging from 306dB at 20Hz to 287dB at 1kHz and still 217dB at 20kHz Distortion at typical recorded levels was very low at 0005 at all frequencies and all that can be seen in the spectrum of a 1kHz signal at 5mV input are some lowlevel supplyrelated spuriae  Intermodulation distortion via the phono input  was also superbly low the 1kHz difference component lying at –86dB Fig12 Rogue Sphinx phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 384mV  into 100k ohms Fig13 Rogue Sphinx phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 2V peak into 100k ohms Even without taking into account its affordable price Rogue Audios Sphinx offers excellent measured performance with little sign of the usual compromises made in classD designs It also has an excellent movingmagnet–compatible phono stage
