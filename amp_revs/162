0, Parasound Halo Integrated   As usual  amplifier before measuring it by running both channels at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that period the top panel was hot reaching 1374°F  by the vents over the internal heatsinksI began by looking at the Halos phonostage performance taking the amplifiers output from the fixedlevel Rec Out jacks with the volume control at its minimum setting so that the highlevel tests wouldnt overload the poweramplifier stage With the phono input set to moving magnet the voltage gain was 342dB set to moving coil it was 538dB Each value is appropriate for that type of phono cartridge Measured at the speaker outputs with the volume control at its maximum setting these phonostage gains were 64 and 94dB respectively Both settings inverted absolute polarity Set to 47k ohms the input impedance was 47k ohms at 20Hz 445k ohms at 1kHz and 38k ohms at 20kHz with this setting at 100 ohms the input impedance measured 100 ohms at all audio frequenciesThe RIAA response error was respectably low  especially in the left channel  but both channels can be seen to apply the socalled Neumann fourth pole resulting in an output that is up 9dB at 100kHz While some justify this modification to the RIAA curve on theoretical grounds I dont like to see it because it boosts the ultrasonic content of unequalized signals such as record ticks and clicks Channel separation was high at 70dB above 1kHz and the signalnoise ratio measured with the inputs shorted and a 22Hz–22kHz bandwidth was good at 698dB  and 54dB  Aweighting respectively increased these ratios to 699 and 61dBFig1 Parasound Halo Integrated phono input response with RIAA correction  The Halos phono stage was extremely linear Even with a 1kHz signal at 20mV the MM setting produced just a tiny amount of secondharmonic distortion  and with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at the same equivalent level there was a negligible amount of intermodulation distortion  Correlating with this excellent linearity the phonostage overload margin was also excellent at around 25dB across the audioband at both MM and MC settingsFig2 Parasound Halo Integrated phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 1V into 100k ohms Fig3 Parasound Halo Integrated phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 1V peak into 100k ohms Turning to the digital inputs again I assessed their performance at the fixed output jacks Using my MacBook Pro on battery power to look at the USB input this operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode and the Halo was identified as PARASOUND—Digital Audio with the manufacturer string VIA Technologies Inc The USB input accepted sample rates up to 384kHz plus unusually 7056kHz and integer bit depths up to 32 The TosLink input accepted data with a 192kHz sample rate which is commendable All digital inputs preserved absolute polarity A fullscale tone at 1kHz resulted in an analog output of 192V at the fixed output Because a tone at –20dBFS with the volume control at its maximum setting produced 187V at the speaker outputs measured into 8 ohms the digital inputs shouldnt be used with the volume control above 300 or so The reconstruction filters impulse response is shown in fig3 the filter is a conventional finiteimpulseresponse type with a response that rolls off rapidly above 21kHz with 441kHzsampled data  With a fullscale tone at 191kHz  the third harmonic lies at –86dB  suggesting that the digital circuitry offers low levels of harmonic distortion This was confirmed by other tests  Fig7 shows the Halos digitalinput frequency response with sample rates of 441 96 and 192kHz via the TosLink input and 384kHz via the USB input The ultrasonic output conforms to the same gentle rolloff but rolls off sharply just below each Nyquist frequency  at the three lower rates At the 384kHz rate the smooth rolloff continues reaching –185dB at 190kHzFig4 Parasound Halo Integrated digital input

192kHz  384kHz  Channel separation via the digital inputs was good at 95dB in both directions below 7kHz Feeding the Halo data representing a 1kHz tone with first 16bit data  then 24bit data  showed that the increase in bit depth dropped the noise floor by almost 20dB which suggests that the Halo has better than 19bit resolution Repeating these measurements with USB data gave the same result indicating that the Halos USB input correctly handles 24bit data While many very lowlevel powersupply–related spuriae can be seen in fig8 these didnt affect the Halos accurate reproduction of undithered 16bit and 24bit tones at exactly –9031dBFS Fig8 Parasound Halo Integrated digital input spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Fig9

toggled at 229Hz 24bit data from SYS2722 via TosLink  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzTurning to the Halos behavior via its line inputs and measured at the speaker outputs the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was 396dB into 8 ohms via the balanced jacks and 397dB via the unbalanced jacks The balanced input impedance was 40k ohms across the audioband and the unbalanced impedance was 24k ohms again across the audioband While the balanced input preserved absolute polarity the unbalanced inputs were invertingThe output impedance was very low at 009 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz  rising slightly to 011 ohm at 20kHz The modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction between this output impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore very small  This graph indicates that the Halo has a wide bandwidth the response into 8 ohms reaching –3dB at 100kHz As a result the Parasounds reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was excellent  with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing The traces in fig13 were taken with the volume control at its maximum setting Repeating the measurements at lower settings preserved both the close channel matching and the wide bandwidthFig13 Parasound Halo Integrated volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig14 Parasound Halo Integrated smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThere was an audible 036dB insertion loss at 1kHz when the tone controls set to their central detented positions were switched into circuit Fig15 shows the effect of the treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum settings these are very similar in behavior to the controls of Parasounds Halo P 5 preamplifier which Art Dudley reviewed in April 2014 The behavior of the Halo Integrateds subwoofer and crossover controls also look very similar to the P 5sFig15 Parasound Halo Integrated frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with tone controls set to flat  and maximum and minimum positions Channel separation at 1kHz was good rather than great at 70dB decreasing to 50dB at the top of the audioband The wideband unweighted SN ratio measured with the inputs shorted but the volume control at its maximum setting was good at 73dB ref 283V into 8 ohms This improved to 78dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 825dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis revealed that AC supply components were at a low level Fig16 Parasound Halo Integrated spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 1V into 100k ohms Figs 17 and 18 plot the percentage of THDnoise in the Halos output as it drove 8 and 4 ohms respectively These graphs show that the Parasound met its specified power of 160Wpc into 8 ohms  and 270Wpc into 4 ohms  at 1 THDN Fig19 plots the THDN percentage against frequency at a fairly high level 20V equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms Fig19 also shows that the amplifier offers low levels of distortion into the two higher impedances but begins to stress out into 2 ohms  The distortion signature is strongly thirdharmonic in nature  and intermodulation is also very low even at high powers Fig17 Parasound Halo Integrated distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig18 Parasound Halo Integrated distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4
