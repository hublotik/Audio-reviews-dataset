0, First Watt J2     J2 by running it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour  At the end of the hour the heatsinks were hot at 1256°F  though the top panel was a little cooler at 1133°F The First Watts voltage gain into 8 ohms measured a lowerthanaverage 195dB from both its balanced and unbalanced inputs and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  The unbalanced input impedance measured the specified 100k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to a still high 65k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was a consistent 208k ohms across the audiobandThe output impedance was relatively high for a solidstate design at 05 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz As a result the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±035dB  This graph taken with a balanced input  shows that the audioband response is flat into 8 ohms  with the ultrasonic rolloff reaching –15dB at 100kHz The response rolled off a little earlier with lower impedances but even into 2 ohms the response was down by just 025dB at 20kHz  The J2 reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing Fig1 First Watt J2 balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 First Watt J2 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 3kHz and still 80dB at 20kHz The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio ref 283V and measured with the input shorted to ground was a respectable 841dB  which improved to 883dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 9975dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the J2s noise floor  revealed spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics which will be due to a nonzero impedance to ground and at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics which will be due to magnetic interference from the AC power transformer All of these spuriae are very low in level however and will not be audibleFig3 First Watt J2 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms With clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 fig4 reveals that the J2 clipped at 25Wpc into 8 ohms  with a gentle rise in THDN below that power Unusually but as specified the J2 delivers less power into 4 ohms  clipping at 125Wpc  In general while the First Watt offers low levels of distortion into 8 ohms it is less comfortable into lower impedance This is shown graphically in fig6 which plots the percentage of THDN into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms Fig4 First Watt J2 both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 First Watt J2 both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 First Watt J2 THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fortunately and as specified by the J2s designer Nelson Pass its distortion into higher impedances is primarily the sonically benign second harmonic  though the third harmonic becomes stronger into 4 ohms and is accompanied in the left channel by some higher oddorder harmonics  Intermodulation distortion into higher impedances was also low  with the secondorder difference component at 1kHz lying at –74dB  Into 4 ohms this component rose by 10dB to 006 —but again the left channel  appears less linear than the right  into this lower impedance with higher levels of higherorder intermodulation productsFig7 First Watt J2 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms 0035 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 First Watt J2 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Fig9 First Watt J2 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 2W into 4 ohms Fig10 First Watt J2 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms Fig11 First Watt J2 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 2W peak into 4 ohms Other than the slightly worse linearity of the left channel into lower impedances the First Watt J2 measured well But its measured performance does suggest that owners not use it with speakers that drop below 4 ohms But as HR found with higherimpedance speakers the J2 will sing
