0,Because the Gryphon Apex Stereo is big and heavy I drove to Michael Fremers place in deepest darkest New Jersey  digital and analog oscilloscopes and test loads  amplifier by operating it at 18 the specified power into 8 ohms for 20 minutes At the end of that time the temperature of the heatsinks was 1136°F454°C and that of the top panel 1053°F408°C The bias was set at High for all testingThe Gryphon Apex Stereo has only balanced inputs The voltage gain at 1kHz was 3085dB into 8 ohms very close to the specified gain of 31dB The amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting The input impedance is specified as 20k ohms I measured 199k ohms at low and middle frequencies decreasing inconsequentially to 195k ohms at the top of the audiobandGryphon specifies the Apexs output impedance as 0015 ohms My measurement was slightly higher in the right channel at close to 005 ohms  and significantly higher in the left channel at 017 ohms I checked the wiring and connections and found nothing amiss I am at a loss therefore to explain this discrepancy The variation in the smallsignal frequency response of the Apexs right channel into our standard simulated loudspeaker  was inconsequential Into resistive loads  the amplifier gently rolled off well above the audioband with the –3dB frequency dependent on the load and channel The left channels response into 2 ohms  was down by 3dB at 130kHz The Apexs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringingFig1 Gryphon Apex frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 Gryphon Apex smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsAs expected from its dualmono construction the Apexs channel separation  was superb at 100dB in both directions below 2kHz and still 80dB at the top of the audioband The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  was very good measuring 734dB  This ratio improved to an excellent 85dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 906dB left and 941dB right when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the Gryphon Apex Stereo drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  revealed that although some ACrelated spuriae were present these all lay at or below –100dB in the left channel  and –110dB in the right channel  The Apex has individual AC power cords for its two channels To avoid a ground loop I plugged my test equipment into the same wall outlet as the left channel However I dont believe this was the reason for the higher level of noise and spuriae in the left channel as the spectrum was the same whether I grounded the XLR inputs pin 1 or left it floating In any case though higher than in the left channel the level is still very lowFig3 Gryphon Apex spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Gryphon Apex Stereos maximum continuous power with both channels driven is specified as 210Wpc into 8 ohms  420Wpc into 4 ohms  and 800Wpc into 2 ohms  The Gryphon amplifier exceeded its specified powers into the higher impedances With our usual definition of clipping as being when the THDnoise reaches 1 I measured a clipping power with both channels driven of 240Wpc into 8 ohms  and 450Wpc into 4 ohms  With one channel driven the Apex clipped at 750W into 2 ohms  even though the wall voltage had only dropped slightly at that power from 1201V to 1195VFig4 Gryphon Apex left channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Gryphon Apex left channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Gryphon Apex left channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsFigs4 5 and 6 were taken from the left channels output Fig7 shows how the percentage of THDnoise varies with frequency into 8 4 and 2 ohms at 20V  The THDN was significantly lower in the right channel  than the left  though still low into the higher impedancesFig7 Gryphon Apex THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The left channels distortion signature into 8 ohms predominantly comprised the second and third harmonics  Spectral analysis at the same power  revealed that while the third harmonic lay at similar levels in both channels the second harmonic was 16dB higher in the left channel  than the right  lying at –73dB compared with –89dB Even with the left channels higher level of harmonic distortion than the right the Apex still did well driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  The 1kHz difference product lay 83dB  and 87dB  below the peak signal level and while the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were a little higher in both channels they still lay at or below –72dBFig8 Gryphon Apex left channel 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00278 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Gryphon Apex spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50Wpc into 8 ohms Fig10 Gryphon Apex HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms Presumably the left channels higher levels of distortion and noise and its higher output impedance than the right channels are samplespecific But even so the Gryphon Apex Stereo offers high power coupled with a wide bandwidth and primarily low levels of loworder distortion I wish I could have stayed longer at Mikeys to listen to it driving his Wilson Chronosonic XVX speakers but I had to beat the rushhour traffic back to Brooklyn
