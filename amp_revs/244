0, Niles SI2150 Class D amplifier He purchased it refurbished and I see it for sale at 367 Original cost seems to be US 850By using efficient Hypex UcD250LP class D amplifier modules the SI2150 manages to fit in a small 1U rack chassisNiles is targeting this amp as Custom Integration  channel so has good control as far as trigger and suchIn use the unit stayed cool and calm When pushed into clipping it will go into protection Sadly it stays in that mode until it is power cycled rather than recovering on its ownNice set of gain controls are provided which lets you get precise channel matching  something that is rarely the case in many amplifiers I set them to 29 dB for my testingAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone dashboard into 4 ohm loadSINAD which is the ratio of distortion and noise versus signal is better than average at 85 dBSignal to noise ratio ranks in the same regionFrequency response is flat enough in audible bandPower into 4 ohm shows good noise and distortionLots of power is available if we allow the distortion to rise to 1Response into 8 ohm load is rather oddUsually we have a declining graph with hard clipping in solid state amplifiers not this gradual rise in distortion As such it was not easy to determine the clipping point as I normally doTypical of class D amps the relationship with frequency and power is complexRemoving my ultrasonic filter allows us to see the switching spectrum of the amplifierConclusionsI am not sure at the regular list price but at refurbished cost this is a steal of an amplifier Lots of power in a cool small enclosure with above average distortion and noiseI am going to put the Niles SI2150 on my recommended list
