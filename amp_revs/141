0, Naim Uniti Nova   and before I did so I installed the Naim app on my iPad mini and used it to reset the Naim to the factory default settings  Usually before I test an amplifier I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour However the Naim turned itself off after 15 minutes displaying the message Over temperature please wait for the product to cool down The top panel above the sidemounted heatsinks was indeed very hot at 1181°F  After the Uniti Nova had cooled down a bit it turned itself back on and I continued the testingLooking first at the analog inputs the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 3535dB The gain at the preamplifier outputs was 67dB These inputs preserved absolute polarity  at all three sets of outputs The input impedance was a usefully high 50k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping inconsequentially to 42k ohms at 20kHzThe headphone output impedance was extremely low at 05 ohms at all audio frequencies The output impedance at the speaker terminals was 03 ohm at all audio frequencies as a result the modulation of the Naims frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±02dB  The response is down by 2dB at 20kHz and peculiarly it drops off very rapidly above 20kHz When I looked at the Uniti Novas reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave  I understood what was happening The overshoot and ringing indicate that the Naim converts its analog inputs to digital apparently with a sampling rate of 48kHz This means of course that a 10kHz squarewave will be reproduced as a sinewave  all the oddorder harmonics that contribute to the square shape being stripped off by the antialiasing filter The volume control operated in steps of approximately 04dB with the unitygain setting at 43 of a possible 100 However as set the analog inputs overloaded at 265V which means that source components with a maximum output level higher than this should be avoidedFig1 Naim Uniti Nova analog input frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Naim Uniti Nova analog input smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Naim Uniti Nova analog input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation via the analog inputs was good rather than great at 71dB R–L and 84dB L–R at 2kHz decreasing by 20dB at the top of the audioband  Spectral analysis of the Naims lowfrequency noise floor  revealed a somewhat high level of random noise as well as AC supply components at 120 and 240Hz  The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the input shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum the worst case was just 639dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This improved slightly to 666dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 693dB when AweightedFig4 Naim Uniti Nova analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Figs 5 and 6 plot the percentage of THDnoise in the Naims output against power into 8 and 4 ohms Specified as delivering 80Wpc into 8 ohms  and 155Wpc into 4 ohms  the Uniti Nova delivered 103Wpc into 8 ohms at clipping  with both channels driven  and 160Wpc into 4 ohms  The wall voltage was a little high  when I performed this test with the Naim clipping which goes some way toward explaining why it delivered more than its specified power I measured how the THDN varied with frequency at a level 20V where I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise  While there was a rise in THD in the top two octaves this was relatively small The distortion itself comprised the relatively innocuous second and third harmonics  and intermodulation distortion was respectably low in level Fig5

DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms Turning to the Uniti Novas behavior with digital data I tested it using the Audio Precisions TosLink and coaxial SPDIF inputs and repeated the tests with WAV AIFF and DSD files stored on an SDcard that I plugged into the rearpanel port The Naim successfully played PCM data sampled up to 384kHz as well as both DSD64 and DSD128 files With the volume control set to 100 a 1kHz tone at –20dBFS gave rise to an output of 558mV at the preamplifier outputs 158mV from the headphone jack and 1523V from the speaker outputs the latter equivalent to 29W into 8 ohms As the amplifier clips at 287V this suggests that the volume control not be set above 65 with digital sources With all but the lowlevel tests  Uniti Novas digital performance at the preamplifier outputs but with the volume control set to avoid clipping at the speaker terminalsThe Naims impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a minimumphase type with all the ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the Uniti Novas response didnt start to roll off until just below half the sample rate  An alias at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  is therefore visible Distortion harmonics of this tone are also visible the second harmonic being the highest in level at –66dB Fig10 Naim Uniti Nova digital input impulse response Fig11 Naim Uniti Nova digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz When Naims digital frequency response with SPDIF data I got what appeared to be anomalous results  With 441kHz data  the output stopped just above 20kHz but with data sampled at 96kHz  and 192kHz  the ultrasonic response was down by 9dB at 29kHz These responses were measured at the preamplifier outputs repeating them at the speaker terminals gave the same result other than the rolloff above 20kHz being slightly faster As a check  responses again using WAV files stored on an SD card but found no differences from SPDIF data The Uniti Novas BurrBrown DAC chip does function at sample rates up to 192kHz I suspect that the Uniti Nova downsamples highresolution data so that its DSP can be applied to those dataFig12 Naim Uniti Nova digital input frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  When the Uniti decoded dithered 16 and 24bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with the volume control set to 100 to minimize the effect of its selfnoise the increase in bit depth dropped the noise floor by around 20dB  which implies resolution of greater than 19 bits With an undithered 16bit tone at exactly–9031dBFS  the waveform was symmetrical but the three DC voltage levels described by the data are somewhat obscured by highfrequency noise With undithered 24bit data  the result was a somewhat noisy sinewaveFig13 Naim Uniti Nova digital input spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered

of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit TosLink data As suggested by fig11 the digital inputs distortion signature was primarily the subjectively benign second harmonic  and while actual intermodulation distortion was low in level  the noise floor didnt look random With 16bit JTest data the resultant spectra  were identical whether I fed the Naim optical or coaxial SPDIF data or played the same data stored on the SDcard A slight widening of the spectral spike that represents the highlevel tone at onequarter the sample rate can be seen but all the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave are reproduced at the correct levels  However a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz can be seen in the left channels output these obviously related to the power supply These sidebands are also evident with 24bit JTest data  though the spectrum is otherwise superbly cleanFig16 Naim Uniti Nova digital input spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 0dBFS Fig17 Naim Uniti Nova

Uniti Novas measured performance reveals it to be well sorted as they say in the UK
