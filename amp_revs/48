0, Pass Labs XA305s measured behavior with Stereophiles loaner sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain s on an amplifier I run it for 60 minutes at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage Superficially the XA305 appears to be a 30Wpc classA design But this is not the maximum output power The specifications list the amplifiers maximum output voltage as ±35V which assuming this is the RMS voltage is equivalent to 153W into 8 ohms The XA305 thus transitions into classB for the top 6dB of its dynamicrange capability I therefore preconditioned the Pass amplifier by running it at 40Wpc into 8 ohms for an hour The heatsinks were just over 60°C  at the end of that period the distortion had dropped slightly from 00192 to 00176The XA305s voltage gain into 8 ohms was 2665dB from both balanced and unbalanced inputs and both sets of inputs reserved absolute polarity ie were noninverting  The input impedance of the balanced XLR jacks was 29k ohms close to the specified 30k ohms the input impedance of the singleended RCA jacks was higher than specified at 20k ohms Both figures were constant across the audiobandThe output impedance was low at 008 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising inconsequentially to 01 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the usual Ohms Law interaction between its source impedance and the modulus of the loudspeakers impedance remained within ±001dB limits  This graph also reveals excellent channel matching as well as a wide smallsignal bandwidth—the –3dB point lies at around 125kHz The XA305s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was consequently superbly square  with short risetimes and no hint of overshoot or ringing The 1kHz squarewave  was similarly well formedFig1 Pass Labs XA305 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Pass Labs XA305 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Pass Labs XA305 smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was superb at better than 110dB below 5kHz and still 98dB  and 104dB  at 20kHz The audioband unweighted signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms was an excellent 836dB increasing to 872dB when AweightedFig4 shows how the THDnoise percentage in the amplifiers output varies with output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms While the XA305 may give 30Wpc into 8 ohms in classA  the distortion at this power level is low at 0015 The amplifier doesnt actually clip  until a much higher power level 130Wpc into 8 ohms  Even higher powers were available into lower impedances before clipping 195Wpc into 4 ohms with both channels driven  and 332W into 2 ohms with one channel driven  The shapes of the traces in fig4 indicate that the distortion starts to rise out of the noise floor at output powers above a few watts with then a gentle increase until the waveform starts to square off I therefore examined how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at a level of 105V equivalent to 138W into 8 ohms The results are shown in fig5 While the distortion is very low in the low and middle frequencies it does start to rise with increasing frequency above 500Hz and is worse into 2 ohms  than into higher impedancesFig4 Pass Labs XA305 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsFig5 Pass Labs XA305 THDN  vs frequency at 105V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms What matters more than the absolute level of an amplifiers distortion is its spectral composition Fig6 reveals that the XA305s THD is almost pure third harmonic even at a level where the amplifiers output stage is no longer running in pure classA And as youd expect from the rich bias level there is no hint of crossover distortion FFT analysis indicates that while there is some second harmonic present as well as the third it lies about 100dB down from the fundamental level  and all higherorder harmonics are very low in level The presence of sidebands at ±120Hz around the fundamental and third harmonic however suggests that the amplifier is working hard Still all powersupply–related spectral components are at or below –108dB which is negligibleFig6 Pass Labs XA305 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms  0023 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig7 Pass Labs XA305 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 37W into 8 ohms Finally the XA305s decreasing linearity in the top octaves led to a somewhat disappointing result on the highpower highfrequency intermodulation test particularly with the right channel   While the secondorder difference component from the 1920kHz test signal was respectably low at –103dB left channel  and –94dB right  higherorder products also made an appearance with the 18 and 21kHz tones reaching –60dB  This is very much a worstcase test howeverFig8 Pass Labs XA305 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 75W peak into 8 ohms Pass Labs XA305 is a JekyllandHyde amplifier Ostensibly a 30Wpc classA design its measured performance reveals that it can actually deliver clippingfree peaks 6dB higher in power while the fact that its distortion under those conditions is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic is commendable
