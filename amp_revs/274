0, Outlaw Model 5000 five channel home theater amplifier It was kindly purchased by  drop shipped to me Despite the number of channels and power of each the Model 5000 costs only US 649 though shipping adds fair bit to itThe shipping is expensive because this is thing is super heavy It is at the limit of what I can reasonably carry upstairs to my lab My back nearly got killed just rotating the darn thing in my photo boothSadly as you see there are no balanced XLR inputs You are given heavy binding posts though which is niceLeft and right channels are far apart which is the right away to do it as they and the center channel get beat the most And is most logical layout in my bookIn use the Model 5000 never complained shut down or anything of the sort The heatsinks are below the top cover so you cant exactly feel their temps I would imagine it would shut down though if it got too hotNot much else to talk about so lets get into the measurementsAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz at 5 watts into 4 ohm loadNice to see the gain at 29 dB which is the only recommended standard in the wild There is fair amount of mains hum and power supply noise I improved them a bit with messing with grounding but this is the nature of the beast when a linear power supply is usedDistortion is dominated by second harmonic which combined with noise and hum gives us a middle or the road SINADSpeaking of noise there is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and near full powerI like to see 96 dB or better at 5 watts to clear the dynamic range of the CD but we dont get there At full power though we meet that target and a bit more in the good channelFrequency response is basically flat in the audible bandTesting with my simulated speaker model did not change the response hardly at allCrosstalk was good as it should be in modular amplifiers like this with independent ampsAmplifier Power MeasurementsMost important deal with any amplifier is its power versus distortion and noise so lets start with 8 ohm loadNice to see the Outlaw 5000 completely outclass our NAD AVR both in much lower noise distortion and available power The picture is almost the same with 4 ohm load although distortion risesThese are two channel tests Adding two more 4 ohm loads power drops a bit naturallyThat is over 800 watts delivered into the load which is greatBack to two channel power here is what we get with short bust  and more steady state  both at 1 THDNThe toughest test I run is power versus frequency while trying to achieve 01 THDN The amp has to deliver its output while being stressed the entire 3 to 4 minutes the test runs Many AVRs quit Not so with Outlaw 5000As you see it not only passed the 2 channel test but also 4 channel A quick statistical analysis of my highres music library shows highest peaks at 40 Hz and that is where the cursor is We are getting 252 watts at that frequency with two channels and 207 watts with four channels Yes it is lower than 1 kHz peak I use in other graphs but still a lot of powerConclusionsDespite its bargain price the Outlaw Model 5000 is solidly built and delivers tons of power without complaining It provides a clear setup over the builtin amplifiers in home theater AVRs No it doesnt deliver state of the art distortion and noise For that you will have to pay a lot more money For what it is it is very good and I am happy to recommend the Outlaw Model 5000
