0, McIntosh MC275 I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain The MC275 has four output terminals for each channel one labeled Common the others 4 8 and 16 I performed a complete set of measurements from each output transformer tap using the balanced inputs and repeated some of the tests using the unbalanced input jacksWith balanced drive the voltage gain into 8 ohms was on the low side at 172dB from the 4 ohm tap 205dB from the 8 ohm tap and 227dB from the 16 ohm tap The unbalanced gains unusually were all exactly 6dB higher than the balanced presumably because of the extra tube stage in this mode Both balanced and unbalanced inputs preserved absolute polarity  from all three output taps  The input impedance at the RCA jacks was a high 86k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 62k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedances were all twice these figures as specifiedThe McIntoshs output impedances were on the low side for a transformercoupled tube design at 033 ohm from the 4 ohm tap 057 ohm from the 8 ohm tap and 087 ohm from the 16 ohm tap These figures applied at low and midrange frequencies the impedance at 20kHz was a little higher at 038 ohm  07 ohm  and 11 ohms  Even so the modification of the McIntoshs frequency response due to the interaction between this source impedance and the impedance modulus of the loudspeaker was relatively mild The gray trace in fig1 for example shows the response with the MC275s 8 ohm tap driving our standard simulated loudspeaker The variations remain within ±05dB limits The limits were ±025dB from the 4 ohm tap  and ±07dB from the 16 ohm tap  Note the slight 012dB channel imbalance in this graph which persisted from all taps into all loads The McIntosh has wide bandwidth its highfrequency response into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm tap not reaching –3dB until 91kHz Its reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave therefore was superbly square  the flat tops of the waveform confirming the excellent lowfrequency extension The 10kHz squarewave was also superb well shaped  with no ringing or overshoot visible Those big output transformers are obviously of high qualityFig1 McIntosh MC275 8 ohm output tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms

separation  was better than 90dB below 1kHz R–L and better than 112dB in the other direction which is excellent The MC275 was also very quiet with unweighted wideband signalnoise ratios  of 89dB left and 88dB right which are superb if partly the result of the lowish gain in balanced mode Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these respective ratios to 965 and 935dB while Aweighting the measurements gave 1002 and 101dB Its hard to believe that this amplifier was designed in 1961Figs6 7 and 8 plot the THDnoise percentage against output power from the 4 8 and 16 ohm outputtransformer taps respectively With each taps nominal value matched to the load the McIntosh amplifier more than meets its specified output power of 75Wpc  with 90Wpc available from the 4 ohm tap at clipping into 4 ohms  85Wpc available from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms  and 92Wpc from the 16 ohm tap into 16 ohms   These graphs show that the distortion remains well below 01 as long as the nominal tap value is equal to or less than the load impedance  But when the load impedance is significantly below the tap value the distortion quickly rises above 01 even at low powers So even though the 16 ohm tap offers the highest gain there will be very few loudspeakers that this tap will drive in a completely linear mannerFig6 McIntosh MC275 4 ohm output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  16 8 4 2 ohmsFig7 McIntosh MC275 8 ohm output tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  16 8 4 2 ohmsFig8 McIntosh MC275 16 ohm output tap distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  16 8 4 ohmsThe traces in these last three graphs were taken at 1kHz However the MC275 is actually at its most linear in the lower midrange as revealed by figs9 and 10 the plots of the THDN percentage against frequency at 283V from the 4 and 8 ohm taps respectively With the 4 ohm tap driving 16 ohms for example the THDN is a superbly low 0004 at 280Hz The distortion does rise a little at lower frequencies presumably due to the output transformers core starting to saturate and at high frequencies due to the circuits decreasing gainbandwidth product—but this is still a very linear design as long as the load is equal to or greater than the nominal tap valueFig9 McIntosh MC275 4 ohm output tap THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig10 McIntosh MC275 8 ohm output tap THDN vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms In the midrange the predominant distortion present in the amplifiers output is the second harmonic  which is subjectively benign even at much higher levels than offered by the MC275 At low frequencies and higher powers the third harmonic is equal to the second in strength in the right channel  and a regular series of higher harmonics can be seen Finally the MC275s reduced topoctave linearity seen in figs9 and 10 results in a regular series of intermodulation products appearing when the amplifier is asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a moderately high power level  Even so the secondorder or difference product at 1kHz the highestlevel spurious tone lay at –64dB  which is still fairly low in absolute termsFig11 McIntosh MC275 8 ohm output tap 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  005 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig12 McIntosh MC275 8 ohm output tap spectrum

measured performance that the McIntosh MC275 was designed almost half a century ago  Good audio engineering is timeless Footnote 1 I have had the privilege of meeting Mr Corderman a few times most recently at the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show where he was lured out of retirement for the launch of Ken Kesslers book McIntosh    for the love of music
