0, M28    As the Bricasti amplifier is specified as having a maximum output power of 200W into 8 ohms I preconditioned it before the measurements by running it at onethird that power 67W into 8 ohms for an hour following which the top panel was warm at 993°F  and the side panel covering the internal heatsink was only slightly hotter at 1067°F  The THDnoise percentage at this power level was 00017 with the amplifier cold 0002 with it fully warmThe voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 269dB with a balanced input signal 2665dB with an unbalanced signal and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  for both inputs The rearpanel leveltrim control applied three attenuation steps each of 61dB The unbalanced input impedance was a usefully high 88k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping slightly to 36k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedances were twice these values as expected The output impedance including 6 of speaker cable was very low at 005 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 006 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the variation in response due to the interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker  was just ±005dB  The response was perfectly flat in the audioband and down by 3dB at 180kHz into 8 ohms  As a result the M28s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was essentially perfect with no overshoot or ringing  Fig1 was taken with balanced drive with unbalanced drive  the response had a small 018dB plateau in the treble and the ultrasonic output rolled off a little earlier than with a balanced input signalFig1 Bricasti M28 balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Bricasti M28 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Bricasti M28 unbalanced frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms The Bricasti M28 is a very quiet amplifier Its unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted was 805dB improving to 847dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband and to 857dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the amplifiers lowfrequency noise floor while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms  revealed that the powersupply–related spuriae were 60Hz and its odd harmonics—generally due to magnetic interference from the power transformer—but even the highest in level lay at just –110dB Fig4 Bricasti M28 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Figs 5 and 6 plot the percentage of THDnoise against output power into 8 and 4 ohms respectively With clipping defined as the point at which the THDN reaches 1 the M28 exceeded its specified power of 200W into 8 ohms  clipping at 250W  Into 4 ohms the Bricasti amplifier clipped at 490W  When  clipping behavior into 2 ohms the M28s protection circuit operated at 128W into that load  Turning the amplifier off and on again restored normal operationFig5 Bricasti M28 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Bricasti M28 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 Bricasti M28 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThe downward slope of the traces below 10W or so in figs 5 and 6 suggests that even with the low noise the M28s actual distortion lies below that noise floor Therefore to be sure I was measuring actual distortion I examined how the amplifiers THDN percentage varied with frequency at 9V which is equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms 20W into 4 ohms and 40W into 2 ohms The results are shown in fig8 the THD is superbly low at or below 1kHz even into 2 ohms  but rises slightly in the treble presumably due to the circuits decreasing amount of gainbandwidth margin reducing the amount of corrective negative feedback available But even at 20kHz into 2 ohms the THDN is still just 004Fig8 Bricasti M28 THDN  vs frequency at 9V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The distortion signature was predominantly thirdharmonic in nature  though fig10 reveals that even at 40 power into 4 ohms this lay at –90dB  Even with the slight rise in THD in the top octave intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level a few dB below visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope into 4 ohms was very low  The difference component at 1kHz lay at just –112dB below the peak signal level  and the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were at –97dB Fig9 Bricasti M28 1kHz waveform at 75W into 8 ohms 00019 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Bricasti M28 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms Fig11 Bricasti M28 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms Its measured performance reveals Bricastis M28 to be a worthy stablemate to the companys superbmeasuring and equally superbsounding M1 DA processor
