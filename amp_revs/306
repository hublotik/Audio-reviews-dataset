0, Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 integrated amplifier with tube buffer   costs US 1599The front panel of the Sphinx portrays a highend look with its thick metalAlas that thin metal surrounding it takes that impression away I liked the very wide apart inputs and output terminals which should bode well for crosstalk measurementsThere is good bit of weight to the unit courtesy of power transformer I like the inclusion of the balance control As you see in the first picture I had to use it to get same gain out of both channels Protection circuit was well done with automatic recovery and worked great no matter how hard I pushed itInternal amplification is provided by a pair of Hypex UCD 180 OEM class D amplifiers A buffer state made out of tubes completes the pictureThe amplifier has won many accolades as indicated by their mention on the product pageLets see if objectively they are rightRogue Audio Sphinx V3 MeasurementsAs usual I set the gain to 29 dB and feed the amp a 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm at 5 watts and see what we getWhat we get is not very nice Broad set of harmonics to the tune of 80 dB do away with any notion of tube sound Add fair bit of noise and SINAD which is a measure of distortionnoise sinks quite lowThats 10 dB worse than the media across 140 amplifiers tested so far Not good As a reference Hypex specifications shows a SINAD of 84 dB so 15 dB was lost in the addition of the buffer stage in this amplifierAnother thing that is not good is signal to noise ratioSo even at full power your 2 bits short of CDs dynamic range The shocker was the normally innocent crosstalk test which just about every amplifier does well inThen comes Sphinx losing to our 20 throwaway amplifier Clearly zero attention was paid to isolation of the two channelsFrequency response also shows sloppy attention to producing the audible band properlyLets measure our power vs distortionDefinitely much less happy driving 4 ohm load Here is our peak and max powerSo moderately powerful although without much headroomConclusionsRogue Audio takes a perfectly serviceable Hypex UcD 180 amplifiers and adds copious amount of noise and distortion with its frontend Mind you despite use of the tube it doesnt give that 2nd harmonic dominant result It just raises the noise and distortion robbing you of transparency But hey folks buy audio products by how many myths are included in their design and Rogue audio gets there with that tube stage Perfect marketing poor engineering Story of highend audioNeedless to say I can NOT recommend the Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 You can get plenty of better amplifiers for this level of money
