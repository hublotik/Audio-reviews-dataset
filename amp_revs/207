0, Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amplifier With the options as tested the cost is US 4212 As the name indicates the amp is based on Hypex NC1200 class D amplifiers plus some value add in the form of Sonic Imagery 990Enh buffers very fancy speaker terminals and even directional fuse from Synergistic ResearchThe enclosure is the same elegant design I have tested before with Purifi modulesAnd here is the back panel connectivityThe massive speaker terminals had no trouble handling my heavy speaker wiresThe trigger input is unusual in that it is supposed to fully shut of the unit consuming no power  The amps are mounted to the bottom of the case as is typically down So the top got slightly warm in testing The bottom though was rather toasty after stress testing I will post a teardown laterIn use the NC1200DM never complained shut down or go into protection Even during my intensive power versus frequency that causes weaker designs to bail out the NC1200DM cruised right onAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard at 5 watts into 4 OhmsChannel matching is quite goodHighest distortion is third harmonic at around 108 dB which mostly responsible for 105 dB of SINAD  This puts the NC1200DM near the top of our rankingsSignal to noise ratio was quite good especially near max power32tone signal resembling music shows exceptionally low intermodulation distortion in audible bandMost meaningful test is power versus distortion and noise so lets get into that with 4 ohm loadWe clock nearly 500 watts before the clipping onset Hypex rates the module at 700 watts which is likely at higher distortion levels  Distortion rises fairly early relative to our referenceI was surprised to once again see how quiet the NC1200DM was when testing at 8 ohms and comparing to Purifi 1ET400A reference designPower output leaves 1ET400A behind at 270 watts The cost is higher distortionKeeping THDN at 01 and sweeping the frequency we getNow we peak at 600 watts Drop at low frequencies where we need power is slight  The sudden drop at 20 kHz is usually due to ultrasonic noise shaping and wide bandwidth of this test  In real use we dont need much power at 20 kHz and at any rate a lot more would be produced than this chart indicatesHere is the intermodulation distortion for 1920 kHz tones for those of you who love this graph Remember that the threshold of hearing is quite high at 19 and 20 khz even for people with healthy response up to these levels And at any rate music never has full amplitude signals at these levelsCrosstalk performance was very good stopping just short of our referenceConclusionsThe Nord One NC1200M Signature Edition produces tons and tons of clean power with very low noise floor While other amps have tested with lower distortion none come to its power output Audiophiles routinely underestimate how much power they need As such it is great to see an amplifier produce so much power while keeping distortion and noise at bay I see no performance flaws anywhereYes the signature components are of dubious value but they are not hurting things eitherThe enclosure is attractive And the whole package light and efficient My kind of design I am happy to give a strong recommendation to the Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amp As always questions comments corrections etc are welcomeThe panther without the head took my car for a joy ride The police caught him before he had an accident Never mind that he has no way of seeing where he was going He doesnt have a drivers license So they impounded my car until I pay his huge fines Just what I needed on top of all the holiday shoppingexpenses Please donate some money so I dont get too depressed over this incident using
