Because Boulder 2150s bulk weight—319 lbs shipping crate—I wouldnt able get stairs test lab much less back stairs So I packed system PC I use control along analog digital oscilloscopes test loads cables I would need drove Michael Fremers lair deepest darkest New JerseyThere I couple problems Usually testing power amplifier I precondition running onethird power 8 ohms hour However onethird Boulders specified maximum power 1000W 333W I dont test load could handle power level hour without overheating Therefore I wasnt able precondition 2150 testing itMy second problem related 2150s power The practical place perform measurements Mikeys garage adjoins house However electrical outlets within reach long extension cords Id brought 15A circuit While allowed test amplifiers distortion clipping power 8 4 ohms circuit breaker tripped powers 800W 2 ohms well specified maximum power 4000W loadThe Boulder 2150s voltage gain 8 ohms 259dB little norm conforming specified 26dB The amplifier preserved absolute polarity pin 2 XLR jack wired hot The input impedance 20Hz 1kHz 194k ohms close specified 200k ohms 20kHz dropped inconsequentially 130k ohms The output impedance including 6 speaker cable extremely low 002 ohm low middle frequencies rose slightly 0026 ohm top audioband As result variation frequency response standard simulated loudspeaker virtually nonexistent The frequency response resistive loads flat audioband 3dB 200kHz The Boulders reproduction 10kHz squarewave featured short risetimes free overshoot ringing Fig1 Boulder 2150 frequency response 283V simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig2 Boulder 2150 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave 8 ohmsThe 2150 extremely quiet—its unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio input shorted ground measured 785dB ref 283V 8 ohms This improved 943dB measurement bandwidth restricted audioband 97dB Aweighted Spectral analysis Boulders noise floor reproduced 1kHz tone 8 ohms indicated powersupply–related spuriae low level primarily comprised 60Hz AC frequency third fifth harmonics close –110dB This spectrum affected I experimented grounding Boulder test systemFig3 Boulder 2150 spectrum 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz 1W 8 ohms Not Boulder 2150 quiet offered low distortion high power Fig4 plots percentage THDnoise output power 8 ohms The downward slope trace 200W indicates whatever distortion present lies noise The 2150 clips sharply reaching 1 THDN 960W This 02dB lower specified 1000W likely due fact I didnt hold wall voltage constant test Fig5 similar graph 4 ohms The 2150 clips 1450W load note I didnt hold wall voltage constantFig4 Boulder 2150 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 8 ohmsFig5 Boulder 2150 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 4 ohmsNot Boulders distortion low 8 ohms hardly changed frequency even 40V There rise higher frequencies level 4 ohms higher 0004 And 1kHz 40V 4 ohms distortion waveform mainly noise faintest hint third harmonic Spectral analysis indicates third harmonic level lies –119dB level third harmonic AC supply frequency Intermodulation distortion also extraordinarily low Fig6 Boulder 2150 THDN vs frequency 40V 8 ohms 4 ohms Fig7 Boulder 2150 1kHz waveform 400W 4 ohms 000036 THDN distortion noise waveform fundamental notched Fig8 Boulder 2150 spectrum 1kHz sinewave DC–20kHz 400W 4 ohms Fig9 Boulder 2150 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz 200W peak 8 ohms Boulders 2150 extraordinary amplifier It measured well taxed capabilities Footnote 1 The SYS2722 superseded higherperformance APx555 going I afford buy one
