0, Niles SI275 stereo power amplifier The SI275 is discontinued But since it is sold to the custom integration channel they come up used and in working orders  I am told it can be picked up as low as US 100 to 150 I see one on Amazon for US 230 But there is a used one on ebay for 100The look is fineI like the tall feet on amplifiers to allow for more air flow A massive heatsink goes the full width of the unit with beefy transistors Love the fact that it has two trim resistors to balance the gain in both channels So annoying that these days balance controls are impossible to find yet amplifiers routinely have gain that is different in each channel Back panel is simplicity in itselfIn use the SI275 was solid as a rock Never shut down Never complained even when fully clipped The top of the unit barely got warm despite using traditional class AB amplification That large and heavy heatsink does a great job of spreading the heat load Nothing remotely like flimsy heatsinks in mass market stereo amplifiers or audiovideo receiversAmplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our dashboardNotice the perfectly matched channels SINAD is middling but is actually better because distortion is near 100 dB It is pulled down by power supply noise which due to being low frequency is not very audible Using what we have performance is slightly above averageNoise performance follows the same standardFrequency response is dead flat in audible band and extends way upThe wider the bandwidth the more challenging the design  Power into 4 ohm is healthyAllowing for 1 THDN we get even more8 Ohm power isResponse with bot loads is very controlled with no oddities Amplifier was stable as soon as powered on and performance did not change much after running for a few minutes ConclusionsThe Niles SI275 is made for abuses of custom integration channel which routinely stuffs amplifiers in places they dont belong  Its construction is well beyond todays mass market product Measured performance is just above average Combine these with prices as low as just 100 and you have a great dealI am happy to recommend used Niles SI275 Bargain shoppers rejoice
