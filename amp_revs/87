0, Masters Series M22   As the M22 has a classD output stage for almost all measurements I used an Audio Precision AUX0025 passive lowpass filter ahead of the analyzer which eliminates noise above 200kHzThe M22s voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 289dB from both its balanced and unbalanced inputs and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  The unbalanced input impedance measured 23k ohms at 20Hz dropping to 18k ohms at 1kHz and 10k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was a consistent 75k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping inconsequentially to 70k ohms at the top of the audiobandThe output impedance was very low for an amplifier with a classD output stage 005 ohm at 20Hz 003 ohm at 1kHz and 007 ohm at 20kHz  As a result the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±005dB  and the audioband response didnt change as a pure resistive load dropped from 8 ohms  to 2 ohms  This graph was taken without the AP lowpass filter a sharply defined peak is visible at 60kHz and is most developed into 8 ohms This ultrasonic peak results in a small degree of critically damped overshoot on the leading edges of a 10kHz squarewave Fig1 NAD M22 balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 NAD M22 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was superb at 100dB in both directions below 2kHz and still 88dB at 20kHz Without the AP lowpass filter and no audio signal around 330mV of RF noise was present at the M22s output with a center frequency of 446kHz  The unweighted signalnoise ratio ref283V into 8 ohms and measured with the NADs unbalanced input shorted to ground was 729dB left and 700dB right these figures improving respectively to 996 and 991dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 1024 and 1019dB when Aweighted This is superb performance but the slightly lower ratios in the right channel are due to a very small amount of powersupply contamination  As all these spuriae are 120dB below the level of a 1W signal they are inconsequentialFig3 NAD M22 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Fig4 plots how the percentage of total harmonic distortion plus noise in the M22s output changed with power into 8 ohms with both channels driven NAD usually specifies maximum power in terms of shortterm delivery but for the M22 quotes a power of 300Wpc into 8 ohms  at 01 THDN with both channels driven Fig4 indicates that the THDN reaches 1  at 340Wpc into 8 ohms  Fig5 shows that the M22 clips at 400Wpc into 4 ohms with both channels continuously driven  while with just one channel driven  the amplifier clips at 570W  Even into 2 ohms the NAD M22 managed to output 700W  with just one channel drivenFig4 NAD M22 both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 NAD M22 both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 NAD M22 one channel driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsWith the M22s very low level of noise I had to test how its THDN percentage changed with frequency at a very high level 283V  to be sure I was looking at true distortion Even so the distortion remained very low and uniform with frequency with a small rise in the top octave  That the distortion waveform at this power level was primarily the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  was confirmed by spectral analysis  Testing the M22 at very high power with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones  showed that the secondorder intermodulation product at 1kHz lay close to –110dB  with the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz higher in the left channel  than in the right  Even so at –82dB  these are of no concernFig7 NAD M22 THDN  vs frequency at 28V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8 NAD M22 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms 00039 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 NAD M22 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms Fig10 NAD M22 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms NADs Masters Series M22 amplifier measures extraordinarily well It is the very model of a modern classD amplifier Footnote 1 Unlike the Spec RPAW7EX RealSound which is also reviewed this month and also uses a classD output stage the M22 didnt interfere with FM radio reception in my test lab
