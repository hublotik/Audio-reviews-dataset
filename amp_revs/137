0, BMC Amplifier C1 I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before testing the BMC I ran both channels at 13 the rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage At the end of that time the C1s chassis was too hot to touch at 145°F  but the amplifier was otherwise operating correctlyThe volume control operated in 66 accurate 1dB steps with the unity gain setting an indicated 39 for balanced inputs 33 for unbalanced The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms using the balanced XLR inputs was lower than usual for an integrated amplifier at 2716dB Unusually the gain using the unbalanced RCA jacks was 6dB higher Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  the input XLR jacks wired with pin 2 hot The unbalanced input impedance was 30k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to 28k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was more than twice this value at 89k ohmsThe output impedance including 6 of speaker cables was low at 01 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 013 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modulation of the Amp C1s frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between this output impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±01dB  This graph shows that the amplifiers response was flat from 10Hz up to 20kHz into 4 and 8 ohms but started to roll off above the audioband into 2 ohms  reaching –025dB at 20kHz The C1s wide bandwidth into higher impedances results in a welldefined 10kHz squarewave  Figs1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to unity gain As Carlos Candeias admitted to Mikey there is some restriction of the amplifiers bandwidth when the volume control was set at or close to its maximum The red and blue traces in fig3 were taken with the control at 66—the response is down by 18dB at 10Hz and 36dB at 20kHz Reducing the setting to 60 brought up the level at 20kHz by 25dB  but the response wasnt flat within the audioband until the volume was reduced another 6dB to 54  But as Carlos Candeias said this will not be an issue with practical sources such as CD players which will require lower settings of the volume controlFig1 BMC Amplifier C1 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 BMC Amplifier C1 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 BMC Amplifier C1 frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with volume control set to 66  60  54  The BMCs channel separation was superb at 110dB in both directions below 2kHz and a stillexcellent 90dB at 20kHz The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio taken with the input shortcircuited and the volume control set to its maximum—very much a worstcase situation—was good rather than great at 721dB in the left channel and 741dB in the right both referenced to 1W into 8 ohms Aweighting improved these ratios to 767 and 787dB respectively And as can be seen in fig4 there are also some lowlevel hum components at the oddorder harmonics of the AC supply in addition to the usual random noise These components are presumably due to magnetic interference from the massive toroidal transformer that dominates the amplifiers interiorFig4 BMC Amplifier C1 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20W into 8 ohms The Amp C1s frontpanel power meters appeared to be correctly calibrated into 4 ohms Fig5 plots the THDnoise percentage in the C1s output against power into 8 ohms Actual distortion starts to rise out of the noise floor above 4W or so when the THDN is just 0011 With actual waveform clipping defined as the point where the THDN reaches 1 the C1 slightly exceeds at 180Wpc  its power specification of 175Wpc Into 4 ohms however it falls short of the specified 330Wpc by just under 1dB outputting 275Wpc into 4 ohms  The Amp C1 did reach 330Wpc at 3 THDN however and its fair to note that I dont hold the AC wall voltage constant for these tests Fig7 shows how the THDN varied with output power into 2 ohms the C1 was less comfortable with this load clipping at just 240W Fig5 BMC Amplifier C1 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 BMC Amplifier C1 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 BMC Amplifier C1 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThis unhappiness with very low impedances can also be seen in fig8 which plots the THDN percentage against frequency at a level 1265V equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms where I could be sure that the reading wasnt being dominated by noise The Amp C1 offers low THD into 8 ohms at this level with the left channel  being slightly more linear than the right  This is reversed into 4 ohms with a somewhat higher level of THD  But with just the left channel driving 2 ohms  the C1 offers more than 10 times the THD that it does into 8 ohmsFig8 BMC Amplifier C1 THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms At low powers into high impedances the distortion is strongly thirdharmonic in nature  which will be subjectively benign But as the output current increases some sharply defined discontinuities appear in the waveform of the spuriae  which indicates the presence of the more subjectively disturbing highorder harmonics  Although fig8 indicates that the BMCs linearity at high frequencies is not significantly worse than at lower frequencies driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz into 8 ohms at a level a couple of dB below visible waveform clipping into 8 ohms gave rise to many highorder products  even though the difference tone at 1kHz lies at a respectably low 86dB  However dropping the power by 5dB significantly reduced the amount of intermodulation distortion Fig9 BMC Amplifier C1 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms  0021 THDN

price but it really shouldnt be used with speakers that drop below 4 ohms it is most comfortable with 8 ohm designs
