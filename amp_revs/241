0, Teac AX501 integrated power  amplifier The AX501 is part of the reference series from Teac so doesnt come cheap as desktop products go I see the price at USD 999 on Amazon plus 35 shipping There is a discount for silver a USD 899 but Amazon doesnt sell it for some reasonWhen I reviewed the Teac HA501 Headphone Amplifier I heaped praise over its modern retro look The AX501 takes that to an entirely different level with addition of a couple of super cute yellow background VU metersWhat is that I should have took the shot with the VU meters working and the light turned on Well the owner played a cruel joke on me by not supplying me with the remote and leaving the setting to off for the VU meter The controls are almost as nice of the HA501 with the exception of the volume control which feels a bit stiff and has some slack in it Otherwise there is nothing to fault it as far as I am concernedHere is the back panelXLR inputs should be mandatory in this price range and I am glad to see then included here  The AX501 uses a classD amplifier and runs as cool as you could get in my testing I dont think it ever got even warm Class D also means light weight and that is NOT the case here The AX501 is a very hefty unit for its size This means it stays put no matter how heavy your cables areNotice the lawyers getting their hands on the unit as to indicate the class of speaker wiring you are supposed to use But hey it is good to know the unit has been through corporate filter of certification and regulationEven though Teac is a Japanese company the AX501 is made in ChinaPower Amplifier MeasurementsLets start with our usual 5 watt dashboard view using XLR inputsEven though Teac specs the AX501 at 1 watt we see the same performance at 5 watts which is nice Distortion and noise as stated in SINAD dB puts the AX501 above average It loses to SONOS Amp using its digital input and ever so slightly outperforms the Amazon Link AmpSignal to noise ratio matches company specFrequency response shows identical output for both channels which is a relief as poorly made classD amps differ in this regardRoll off is early for my taste I like to see flat response to 40 kHz That said early filtering seems to help bring stability to performance of the low cost class D amps and I saw that here as I measured power outputThere is a broad operating range where performance is good between 1 and 30 watts We then run out of juice and clipping occurs at 88 watts Rated output is 100 watts although higher resolution measurement may have gotten us closerThe Amazon Link Amp has more power and SONOS even more You are guaranteed to hear distortion when an amp reaches its max power rating so on this all important metric the Teac AX501 loses to its cheaper rivals And of course we are worlds away compared to reference amps like those based on Hypex NC400I have added a new test to my power amplifier suite and that is intermodulation distortion relative to measured power I ran it against the recently reviewed Klipsch PowerGate Amplifier We see more evidence of the stability and clean performance of Teac AX501 as switchedclass D amplifiers go The IMD graph is also more revealing of distortion set it around 7 to 8 watts and climbing before final clippingHeadphone Amplifier MeasurementsI ran a sampling of my headphone tests starting with power versus distortion using 300 ohm loadWow this is impressive amount of output power at such a high impedance I wonder if we are just looking at the output of the power amplifier reduced with an inline resistor Here is the results with 33 ohm loadOh this is not nearly as good The reason is thisSadly we have a high value resistor in series with the output to the tune of 58 ohm I dont like to see a value much more than 10 ohm and ideally down to 1 to 2 ohmBest use would be high impedance headphone with relatively flat impedance graph versus frequency Otherwise some color will be imparted on the sound ConclusionsPersonally I think Teac has nailed the look and feel of such a desktop product The AX501 is in an entirely different class rivalling Nagra when it comes to switchgear and meters In that regard it is a bargainThe power amplifier seems competent without hairy corner cases It is above average in performance but not rising up to the levels I like to see for 1000 As I noted in the review power is everything and there are much better choices in that regard such as SONOS Amp At nearly half the price it delivers more than twice the power plus a bunch of other features such as included streamingDAC It doesnt look nearly as nice as Teac AX501 thoughThe headphone output is a checklist item although it should sound very good with high impedance headphones The AX501 runs cool and should be quite reliable and safe giving its pedigree Overall I like the Teac AX501 but cant recommend it on performance or value We should be able to do better for 1000 so the search continues
