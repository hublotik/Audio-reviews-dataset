0,Art Dudley is a rapscallion When I hoisted the Simaudio Moon Evolution i7 onto my test bench plugged it in and switched it out of standby its display lit up with the message HELLO JOHN Switching it from Input 1 to Input 2 brought forth the command to BITE ME while Input 3 exclaimed OUCH Stuck up there in the wilds of upstate New York with time weighing heavily on his hands Artie obviously had time to discover a new use for the amplifiers programmable input namesI selected HELLO JOHN with the chunky metal remote and began my test routine With an amplifier this always starts with my preconditioning it by running both channels for 60 minutes at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms which is the worst case for an amplifier with a classB output stage At the end of that hour the Moon i7s sidemounted heatsinks were just too hot to touch while the chassis was warm At the start of the hour the THDnoise measured 0019 after 60 minutes it had dropped inconsequentially to 0018The maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same for both the unbalanced and balanced inputs at a moderate 363dB and all the inputs preserved absolute polarity ie were noninverting The gain at the preamp output jacks was 55dB and these had a source impedance of 50 ohms across the band as specified The balanced input is wired according to the AES convention with pin 2 hot and pin 3 cold At low and midrange frequencies the input impedance with the volume control at its maximum was a reasonably high 19k ohms unbalanced and 32k ohms balanced but dropped at 20kHz to 5k ohms and 14k ohms respectively  Sources with tubed output stages might sound a little rolledoff due to the Ohms Law interaction between the high source impedance and the change in the Moons input impedanceThe i7s output impedance was a very low 005 ohm in the bass and midrange rising to a still low 007 ohm at 20kHz  As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response with changing load impedances was minimal  With the volume control at its maximum setting  the Moons ultrasonic bandwidth extended to –3dB at 91kHz Reducing the gain to unity  raised the 3dBdown frequency very slightly to 95kHz but the audioband response was just as flat With its wide bandwidth the i7 reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with short risetimes but no hint of overshoot or ringing  The 1kHz squarewave  was essentially perfectFig1 Simaudio Moon i7 frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 16 8 4 2 ohms Fig2 Simaudio Moon i7 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was superb in the midrange and below at better than 100dB but it did decrease to a still good 64dB at 20kHz due to the usual capacitive coupling Assessed under the worstcase situation with the input shorted but with the volume control set to its maximum the i7s signalnoise ratio was a good 652dB  and improved to 748dB when AweightedThe Moon amplifier easily exceeded its specified 150Wpc output power reaching the 1 THD clipping point at 200W into 8 ohms  and 326W into 4 ohms  The manner in which the THDN percentage changes with output power into these two loads is shown in fig3 Note that the 4ohm trace stops at 326W this is because the 8A rearpanel fuse blew at that point Replacing it brought the amplifier back into operation but the incident suggested that it would be unwise for me to try sustained highpower testing into loads lower than 4 ohmsFig3 Simaudio Moon i7 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  4 8 ohmsThe shape of the traces in fig3 suggests that the actual distortion rises out of the amplifiers noise floor at around 20W so I plotted how the THDN percentage changes with frequency at 13V equivalent to 21W into 8 ohms The results are graphed in fig4 other than the high treble where there is a slight rise there is very little change as the load impedance halves Adding to that good result the distortion content is heavily thirdharmonic  with some second harmonic becoming apparent at high powers  Both of these harmonics are subjectively innocuous provided the underlying nonlinearity doesnt give rise to excessive intermodulation distortion—and as is shown by fig7 even at a very high output into 4 ohms the distortion products associated with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones are very low in levelFig4 Simaudio Moon i7 THDN vs frequency at 13V into  2 4 8 16 ohms Fig5 Simaudio Moon i7 1kHz waveform at 21W into 8 ohms  00136 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 Simaudio Moon i7 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms Fig7 Simaudio Moon i7 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms Simaudios Moon Evolution i7 amplifier offers excellent measured performance as I have come to expect from this Montrealbased company
