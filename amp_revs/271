0, Class D Audio  CDA250C Power  Amplifier The CDA250C costs USD 495 from the company direct which barely sneaks it into affordable classThere is not a whole lot to look at on the face of the unitAs you see the unit is made in USA I suspect the case is generic Chinese though given the DIY look and feel it hasThe power button is oddly in the right side of the unitThe back panel sports very large speaker jacks which is niceUnfortunately there are no balanced inputs even though the holes seem to be made for themAnother miss is lack of any safety or regulatory certificationIn testing the CDA250C ran completely cool I could not feel slightest rise in temperature of the case whether I touched the top left or right which is really goodMeasurementsLets start with our usual dashboard at 5 watts of outputI was pleased to see the unit working well enough to allow me to measure it down to DC and hence the DC offset Many recent switching amplifiers make my analyzer go crazy if I DC couple of itSINAD  is rather low and seems to be driven by high noise floor than distortion products Signal to noise ratio is disappointingWe cant even clear the CDs 96 dB at either 5 watt We barely get there with 200 watts of output The news gets pretty ugly when I measured THDN versus frequency at six different power levelsWe have multiple problems here At both low and high end of the frequency spectrum we have rising noise and or distortion The higher the power the worse they getAt low power outputs  low frequency noise seems to escalate which may be due to power supply noiseTo top it all two channel are wildly different than each other One seems to be a lot more susceptible to noise than the otherLets look at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone with wide bandwidth and see if we can figure this outI should have run this without my external filter but lets run with it anyway We see our usual spikes in hundreds of kilohertz due to switching frequencies But we also see a rise in noise around 50 kHz or so The previous test uses 90 kHz bandwidth so this peak will impact the measurements Note again the channel mismatchLets rerun the previous test this time by limiting the bandwidth to 224 kHz Note that this means that we cant capture anything past second harmonic for the high frequencies The graph becomes somewhat cleaner especially at low output level  But otherwise the signature issues with distortionnoise remainLets run our typical power versus distortion test Note that 1 kHz tone is used for this test so doesnt incorporate the issues we see aboveWe have good bit of power reaching 178 watts into 4 ohm before clipping sets in FYI I have refined this test to give us more resolution near max power so it is a bit unfair to previous products I tested Still this is quite a bit more power than the two reference amps in the graphWhen I get a chance later I will test the output impedance versus frequency And a frequency response test which I just realized I forgot to run too ConclusionsGetting nearly 200 wattschannel into 4 ohm for a US made power amplifier for 500 is not bad Outside of that you have to close your eyes to many flaws These noise and distortion issues way dwarf anything upstream As such I dont see the Class D Audio CDA250C in any kind of high fidelity system Our search will continue for something with Hypex NC400 performance but at half the priceNeedless to say I cant recommend the CDA250C but you can judge it for yourself and your application based on above data and decide
