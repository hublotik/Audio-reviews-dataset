Class D Audio CDA250C Power Amplifier The CDA250C costs USD 495 company direct barely sneaks affordable classThere whole lot look face unitAs see unit made USA I suspect case generic Chinese though given DIY look feel hasThe power button oddly right side unitThe back panel sports large speaker jacks niceUnfortunately balanced inputs even though holes seem made themAnother miss lack safety regulatory certificationIn testing CDA250C ran completely cool I could feel slightest rise temperature case whether I touched top left right really goodMeasurementsLets start usual dashboard 5 watts outputI pleased see unit working well enough allow measure DC hence DC offset Many recent switching amplifiers make analyzer go crazy I DC couple itSINAD rather low seems driven high noise floor distortion products Signal noise ratio disappointingWe cant even clear CDs 96 dB either 5 watt We barely get 200 watts output The news gets pretty ugly I measured THDN versus frequency six different power levelsWe multiple problems At low high end frequency spectrum rising noise distortion The higher power worse getAt low power outputs low frequency noise seems escalate may due power supply noiseTo top two channel wildly different One seems lot susceptible noise otherLets look spectrum 1 kHz tone wide bandwidth see figure outI run without external filter lets run anyway We see usual spikes hundreds kilohertz due switching frequencies But also see rise noise around 50 kHz The previous test uses 90 kHz bandwidth peak impact measurements Note channel mismatchLets rerun previous test time limiting bandwidth 224 kHz Note means cant capture anything past second harmonic high frequencies The graph becomes somewhat cleaner especially low output level But otherwise signature issues distortionnoise remainLets run typical power versus distortion test Note 1 kHz tone used test doesnt incorporate issues see aboveWe good bit power reaching 178 watts 4 ohm clipping sets FYI I refined test give us resolution near max power bit unfair previous products I tested Still quite bit power two reference amps graphWhen I get chance later I test output impedance versus frequency And frequency response test I realized I forgot run ConclusionsGetting nearly 200 wattschannel 4 ohm US made power amplifier 500 bad Outside close eyes many flaws These noise distortion issues way dwarf anything upstream As I dont see Class D Audio CDA250C kind high fidelity system Our search continue something Hypex NC400 performance half priceNeedless say I cant recommend CDA250C judge application based data decide
