0, Crown XLS2502 DriveCore  2channel amplifier The XLS 2502 cost US 645 including free shipping from Amazon It has DSP functionality which I did not test And is specified to drive 2 ohm loadFrom the outside the XLS2502 is built like a tankIt is very light of course due to switching topology for the amplifier and power supply But also very sturdy with plenty of steel to keep its shapeThe two gain controls are notched which gives them a nice feeling but the gain is not matched and is hard to get there using those notchesHere is the back connectivityThere is a fan as you see but in normal testing it never came up During stress testing it did come on but was pretty quiet compared to what I expected Mind you I dont think you want it close to you if it is going to be runningAlas the fan was insufficient to keep the unit cool under full power The red thermal indicators came up even though the fan was running The amp seemed to be functioning still but to be on the safe side I terminated my testing there In typical home use even for subwoofer duty I doubt that this is a concern as you will see later as far as what wattage we are talking aboutOverall the impression of the amplifier is positive making you think you have something made to be run over by a car and still function reliablyAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 wattsI set the gain to 29 dB for consistency I also tested it at 19 dB gain and it only made 1 to 2 dB improvement The reason is that SINAD  is dominated by harmonic distortion Here those harmonics are very high order which perceptually is not very good as they are not masked as easily Anyway with a SINAD of 71 dB we have below average performanceThe XLS1502 did a bit better in this regard garnering a SINAD of 77 dBFrequency response shows the same sharp cut offI dont know if this can be changed using DSP programming or notAbove is with resistive load Switching to a simulation of a 2way speaker gets us little differenceSo there is some speaker dependency but I would not lose sleep over itCrosstalk is OK but could be betterThe red line is a 30 amplifier by the way32tone test signal simulating music gives a more hopeful picture of distortionThe spray of harmonics is high in frequency where our hearing threshold is higherSignal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts but gets better at full powerLower gain settings may improve this a few dBsAmplifier Power MeasurementsYou dont buy this amplifier to listen at 5 watts so lets see what it can do when its wings are given enough room to flyWow Nearly 500 watts of power is delivered into both channels simultaneously The good news doesnt end there Check out these ratings when distortion is relaxed to 11600 watts of peak power is delivered out of standard 120 volt outlet These thing is a powerful beastNoise level is decent but I wanted to make sure the high gain was not impacting it So I reduced gain to 19 dB which required some 6 volts of input to drive to clippingThere is no difference at allFor the rest of these tests I stayed at 19 dB gain Here is the power output with 8 ohmOver 300 watts at what should be inaudible distortion for most peopleFinally we get to my stress test I played with the settings because the high frequency noise shaping would not let me perform the sweep So I decided to change this test and set the limit to 224 kHz  and limit the sweep to 6 kHz That way the third harmonic of 6 kHz  is still included in the computation No music has full power at high frequencies anyway so I dont think we need to keep measuring to 20 kHz with respect to power Here is the outputAs noted the red warning lights came on as the sweep was going from right to left so I terminated the test Delivered output was about 520 watts which is still plenty but is naturally lower than 1 kHz which was in high 600sConclusionsThese pro amps have mastered the technique of delivering tons of power with distortion and noise kept under control Lack of power is the 1 reason an amplifier can sound bad Dont care how good the SINAD is at 5 watt If you run out of power you will hear distortion lack of dynamics etc So if you need the power it is best to get it than to have less of it And on that front the Crown XLS 2502 delivers tons of it breaking all previous records for any amplifier I have tested The price is ridiculously low for the amount of power you get as wellIdeally you would use more finessed amplifiers above bass frequencies and use the XLS 2502 to drive the subs But if not the XLS2502 can deliver good performanceOverall I am going to recommend the XLS 2502
