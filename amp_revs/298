Crown XLS2502 DriveCore 2channel amplifier The XLS 2502 cost US 645 including free shipping Amazon It DSP functionality I test And specified drive 2 ohm loadFrom outside XLS2502 built like tankIt light course due switching topology amplifier power supply But also sturdy plenty steel keep shapeThe two gain controls notched gives nice feeling gain matched hard get using notchesHere back connectivityThere fan see normal testing never came During stress testing come pretty quiet compared I expected Mind I dont think want close going runningAlas fan insufficient keep unit cool full power The red thermal indicators came even though fan running The amp seemed functioning still safe side I terminated testing In typical home use even subwoofer duty I doubt concern see later far wattage talking aboutOverall impression amplifier positive making think something made run car still function reliablyAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual start dashboard 1 kHz tone 4 ohm load 5 wattsI set gain 29 dB consistency I also tested 19 dB gain made 1 2 dB improvement The reason SINAD dominated harmonic distortion Here harmonics high order perceptually good masked easily Anyway SINAD 71 dB average performanceThe XLS1502 bit better regard garnering SINAD 77 dBFrequency response shows sharp cut offI dont know changed using DSP programming notAbove resistive load Switching simulation 2way speaker gets us little differenceSo speaker dependency I would lose sleep itCrosstalk OK could betterThe red line 30 amplifier way32tone test signal simulating music gives hopeful picture distortionThe spray harmonics high frequency hearing threshold higherSignal noise ratio poor 5 watts gets better full powerLower gain settings may improve dBsAmplifier Power MeasurementsYou dont buy amplifier listen 5 watts lets see wings given enough room flyWow Nearly 500 watts power delivered channels simultaneously The good news doesnt end Check ratings distortion relaxed 11600 watts peak power delivered standard 120 volt outlet These thing powerful beastNoise level decent I wanted make sure high gain impacting So I reduced gain 19 dB required 6 volts input drive clippingThere difference allFor rest tests I stayed 19 dB gain Here power output 8 ohmOver 300 watts inaudible distortion peopleFinally get stress test I played settings high frequency noise shaping would let perform sweep So I decided change test set limit 224 kHz limit sweep 6 kHz That way third harmonic 6 kHz still included computation No music full power high frequencies anyway I dont think need keep measuring 20 kHz respect power Here outputAs noted red warning lights came sweep going right left I terminated test Delivered output 520 watts still plenty naturally lower 1 kHz high 600sConclusionsThese pro amps mastered technique delivering tons power distortion noise kept control Lack power 1 reason amplifier sound bad Dont care good SINAD 5 watt If run power hear distortion lack dynamics etc So need power best get less And front Crown XLS 2502 delivers tons breaking previous records amplifier I tested The price ridiculously low amount power get wellIdeally would use finessed amplifiers bass frequencies use XLS 2502 drive subs But XLS2502 deliver good performanceOverall I going recommend XLS 2502
