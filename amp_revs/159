0, Dan DAgostino Momentum amplifier I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system   my usual procedure is to run it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour With a conventional amplifier using a classAB output stage this level results in the maximum heat dissipation in the output devices Unfortunately after running at this level for 50 minutes serial no0265 turned itself off with its heatsinks way too hot to keep my hand on Those dropdeadgorgeous lacqueredcopper heatsinks may not therefore be as efficient at dissipating heat as more conventional finned heatsinks I let the amplifier cool down but it wouldnt power up again although neither the 75A fuse on the rear panel nor the fuse under the bottompanel access plate had blown I therefore subjected the second sample serial no0266 to a shorter preconditioning time 30 minutes Even so at the end of that time my infrared thermometer indicated that the heatsinks were 1196°F  and the chassis a warm 1052°F  All measurements refer to this second sampleThe Momentums voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 262dB and the balanced input preserved absolute polarity indicating that the XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance was usefully high at 200k ohms in the midrange dropping to 160k ohms at the frequency extremes The output impedance was moderately high for a solidstate design at 021 ohm at 20Hz and 2kHz rising very slightly to 023 ohm at 20kHz  The variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was a moderate ±02dB  Fig1 indicates that the Momentum has a wide smallsignal bandwidth the ultrasonic rolloff into 8 ohms  not reaching –3dB until 110kHz—though this is not quite as wide a bandwidth as the specified –1dB at 200kHz Nevertheless the Momentum reproduced a 10kHz squarewave  with very short risetimes and no hint of overshoot or ringing The 1kHz squarewave was essentially perfect Fig1 Dan DAgostino Momentum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Dan DAgostino Momentum smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Dan DAgostino Momentum smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 283V into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted was a good 772dB this improving to 781dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband Switching an Aweighting filter into circuit improved the SN ratio to 8165dB With the amplifier driving a 1kHz tone into 8 ohms at 100W the Momentums noise floor was disturbed by spuriae at the AC line frequency and its oddorder harmonics  these spuriae most likely due to magnetic interference from the power transformer Nevertheless the spuriae all lie close to or below –100dB  and thus can be considered negligibleFig4 Dan DAgostino Momentum spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Specified as having a maximum power of 300W  the Momentum comfortably exceeded that rating clipping at 405W into 8 ohms  with clipping defined as the point when the percentage of THDnoise in its output reaches 1  Fig6 reveals that the amplifier clips at 640W into 4 ohms  while into 2 ohms  the amplifier puts out 1115W  As with Dan DAgostinos earlier amplifier designs for Krell the Momentum is a powerhouseFig5 Dan DAgostino Momentum distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Dan DAgostino Momentum distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 Dan DAgostino Momentum distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsFigs5 6 and 7 also indicate that the Momentum offers very low distortion at lower powers but that the THD plateaus at 006–008 at moderate powers I therefore measured how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at a level 20V where I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise The result is shown in fig8 THDN remains constant with frequency below the top octave though it does increase as the load impedance drops However there is very little rise in THD above 10kHz suggesting that the Momentum has a commendably wide openloop bandwidthFig8 Dan DAgostino Momentum THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig9 indicates that the distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic though there is a suspiciouslooking spike in the residual waveform almost coincident with each zerocrossing point This spike is the result of a picket fence of higherorder harmonics  though its fair to note that these are all relatively low in level I was a little puzzled given the excellent highfrequency linearity seen in fig8 that the 1kHz difference tone resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 100W into 4 ohms  was moderately high in level at –69dB  with the spuriae at 18 and 21kHz at –74dB  However all other intermodulation products lay at or below –90dB Fig9 Dan DAgostino Momentum 1kHz waveform at 100W into 4 ohms 0084 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Dan DAgostino Momentum spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–10kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Fig11 Dan DAgostino Momentum HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms There are no surprises in the Dan DAgostino Momentums measured performance This is an amplifier that is as wellengineered as it is beautiful to look at
