0, of the Threshold T200 was made in the amplifiers unbalanced mode with selected measurements made in the balanced mode Unless otherwise noted the results presented are for the unbalanced configuration The sample tested  was different from the sample auditioned by RD Threshold submitted a second sample for measurement to expedite the completion of the review by minimizing shipping and customs delays between Santa Fe and RDs abode in the Great White North of Toronto CanadaFollowing the 13power onehour preconditioning test the T200s heatsinks were very warm but could be touched comfortably for an indefinite period The T200 is noninverting in the unbalanced mode in its balanced configuration pin 2 is configured as the positive leg pin 3 the negativeThe T200s input impedance measured 492k ohms unbalanced 926 ohms balanced The latter figure is not a typographical error—the balanced input impedance was under 1k ohms This probably reveals an attempt to maximize power transfer by closely matching the output impedance of the preamp with the input impedance of the power amp The only other manufacturer I know of who does this is the Jeff Rowland Design Group and they provide a switch that allows the user to select a higher balanced input impedanceI have serious reservations about this design philosophy suffice it to say that the input of a power amplifier responds to voltage not power In any event only a preamplifier capable of performing properly with this low a load impedance —or alternately one with a very low output impedance —should be used with the balanced inputs of the T200 For general use the T200s unbalanced inputs would be the safer betThe output impedance of the T200 was 002 ohms at either 1kHz or 20Hz increasing to 0026 ohms at 20kHz Voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 28dB unbalanced 269dB balanced DC offset was moderate at 7mV in the left channel 195mV in the right Signalnoise  measured 892dBFig1 shows the frequency response of the T200 The results shown are for 1W output into 8 ohms  Theres little difference between the balanced and unbalanced modes here The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave is shown in fig2 Theres only a virtually imperceptible degree of rounding at the leading edge and a fast risetime The 1kHz squarewave response was close to perfect and is not shownFig1 Threshold T200 frequency response into 8 ohms in unbalanced mode  and in balanced mode  Fig2 Threshold T200 10kHz squarewaveThe crosstalk shown in fig3 indicates nearly identical performance between channels The increased crosstalk at high frequencies is typical of many twochannel products and is simply the result of capacitive coupling between the channelsFig3 Threshold T200 crosstalk L–R  R–L The T200s THDnoise vs frequency curves are plotted in fig4 with the balanced result at the top the unbalanced result at the bottom Both are extremely low—in fact the result here is primarily noise Theres a slight rise at the highest frequencies into a 2 ohm load  but its relatively insignificant The distortion waveform at a level of 50W into 2 ohms is shown in fig5—at the levels we normally use to obtain this result the distortion was impossible to pick out of the noise The distortion is heavily secondharmonic with some higherlevel harmonics plus noise evident There was a similar result into higher load impedances Fig4 Threshold T200 THDnoise  vs frequency at  1W into 8 ohms 2W into 4 ohms 4W into 2 ohms unbalanced 1W into 8 ohms 2W into 4 ohms 4W into 2 ohms balancedFig5 Threshold T200 1kHz waveform at 50W into 2 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out The spectrum of the T200s output driving 50Hz into 4 ohms at a level of 133W  is shown in fig6 All of the artifacts are under –90dB —a superb result and one of the best Ive ever seen with this test Surprisingly the secondharmonic component seen in fig5 is absent Fig7 shows the spectrum of the T200s output reproducing a combined 1920kHz signal—the intermodulation products resulting from an input signal consisting of an equal combination of these two frequencies—at 111W RMS into 4 ohms  The largest artifacts here are at 18kHz and 21kHz  Of the remainder only the one at 17kHz is marginally higher than –80dB  The 1920kHz spectral response at 61W into 8 ohms indicates even lower intermodulation levels Fig6 Threshold T200 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 133W into 4 ohms Fig7 Threshold T200 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–22kHz 1920kHz at 111W into 4 ohms The 1kHz THDN vs output power curves are shown in fig8 The power increases substantially as the load impedance decreases though doesnt quite double with each halving of impedance down to 2 ohms   The T200s discreteclipping levels  are shown in Table 1Fig8 Threshold T200 distortion  vs output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms and 2 ohmsFinally the THDN vs output for the T200 in bridged mode are shown for both 8 ohm and 4 ohm loads in fig9 As expected the T200 puts out considerably more power in the bridged mode though this mode of operation was not auditionedFig9 Threshold T200 in bridged mode distortion  vs output power into  8 ohms and 4 ohmsThese testbench results show the Threshold T200 to be a firstrate amplifier input impedance use of the balanced input with the T200 will require the user to carefully choose his or her preamp if problems are to be avoided—Thomas J Norton
