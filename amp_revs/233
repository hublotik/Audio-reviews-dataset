0, PS Audio Stellar S300 Stereo Power Amplifier The S300 costs US 1499 from the companyFitting the design language of the rest of the PS Audio and using similar enclosure the S300 is quite hefty considering that it uses classD amplificationThere is just a power switch and light that indicates whether the unit is on or has shut down due to protection circuit kicking inThe back panel shows very high quality and beefy connectorsAs you see there are redundant pairs of speaker sockets which I assume is an invitation to use biwiring Or feed the subwoofer using them as Paul McGowan advocates although a warning tells you to be careful as these are floating signals not ground referencedXLR inputs are nicely provided which I used for all of my testingThe internal amplification is provided by ICEpower 300AS1 modules These are integrated power supply and single channel amplifier modules  PS Audio uses its own input buffer on these which they call Analog Cell This got the owner worried that it would measure poorly as did the PS Audio Stellar Gain Cell Preamplifier and DAC I must say it got me worried reading the description of it tooSeeing how the classd module uses ample feedback to linearize its response it is puzzling that he thinks the input stage should be without one Either feedback is good ro bad Cant have it both waysAnyway back to the operation of the unit it ran cool and never got upset in my testing Overall my subjective impression of the unit is positiveAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs always we start with 5 watt output into 4 ohm and see where we standAh that is respectable FFT spectrum just shows two distortion products with the second one at or below 100 dB There is however noise though which pushes the combination of those distortions and noise to 88 dB resulting in SINAD of same amount only positive This puts the S300 amplifier above our median for all power amplifiers tested so farOur frequency response is a bit variable at the high endI looked up the 300AS1 response as shown in the inset and is consistent with that While most of us wont hear that rise in response it does show load dependency which means each speaker will interact with it differentlyAll my tests use an AES17 filter which has a flat response to 40 kHz and beyond But for the purposes of finding the actual highbandwidth spectrum of the unit I take it out for this test of 1 kHz tone at 5 wattSwitching frequency is around 450 kHz which is fine Typical of many of these classd modules the level is high at just 15 dB below signal DonH56 recently asked me if the level of switching noise tracks the signal itself so I decided to test for that by upping the power by a good bit to 180 watts and see what happensAs you see in blue there is good news and bad news Good news is that the level doesnt scale with output power much Bad news is that its spectrum becomes quite wide so total energy may have increased that much Certainly scary to the eye but likely not to the ear Anyway back to our regular programming here is our signal to noise ratioNot that good at 5 watt as we could have predicted from the SINAD in the dashboard At full power the situation improves but still not very competitive with top of the class switching amplifiers which can clock as high as 125 dB So be careful with sensitive speakersMost important graph for amplifiers is power versus distortionnoise Here it is into 4 ohmWe have tons of good power to the tune of 256 watts Distortion starts to rise early though at just 10 wattsHere is the response into 8 ohmPerhaps more revealing is what happens if we perform the same sweep but at different frequencies starting at 20 kHz and working our way down to 20 Hz An ideal amplifier would have all the graphs landing on top of each other But this is what we get hereAt frequencies up to 1 kHz the graphs indeed nicely land on top of each other  But at 5 kHz and higher we get very odd responses indicating multiple nonlinearities taking turn to dominate I thought this was an issue with PS Audio implementation but the same response is shown by ICEPower in their data sheetPeak power shows disappointing level of headroom available for short durations as would be typical in musicThe switching power supplies in classd amplifiers are tightly regulated which means the power you get in steadystate is what you get in peak Standard class AB amplifiers tend to have variable supply rails which if you dont tax much will maintain higher voltage and produce more power in short bursts For this reason you may want to get a more powerful class D amplifier to replace a class AB ampConclusionsIt is a sigh of relief that PS Audio had not managed to reduce the performance of the ICEPower modules Response and sonic abilities are completely determined by those modules unlike what PS Audio marketing says The ICEPower module used here has a distinctly lower performance than Hypex modules we have tested in the past So you are not going to get stateoftheart performance For that you need to go to amplifiers higher in the SINAD graphStill this is a competent wellbuilt and wellsupported amplifier based on proven amplification modules within Build quality is much higher than DIY or garage shop amplifiers using Hypex modules 1500 is not a ton of money given these attributes For these reasons and good looks of the unit I am going to put the PS Audio Stellar S300 amplifier on my recommended list
