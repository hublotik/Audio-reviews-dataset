PS Audio Stellar S300 Stereo Power Amplifier The S300 costs US 1499 companyFitting design language rest PS Audio using similar enclosure S300 quite hefty considering uses classD amplificationThere power switch light indicates whether unit shut due protection circuit kicking inThe back panel shows high quality beefy connectorsAs see redundant pairs speaker sockets I assume invitation use biwiring Or feed subwoofer using Paul McGowan advocates although warning tells careful floating signals ground referencedXLR inputs nicely provided I used testingThe internal amplification provided ICEpower 300AS1 modules These integrated power supply single channel amplifier modules PS Audio uses input buffer call Analog Cell This got owner worried would measure poorly PS Audio Stellar Gain Cell Preamplifier DAC I must say got worried reading description tooSeeing classd module uses ample feedback linearize response puzzling thinks input stage without one Either feedback good ro bad Cant waysAnyway back operation unit ran cool never got upset testing Overall subjective impression unit positiveAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs always start 5 watt output 4 ohm see standAh respectable FFT spectrum shows two distortion products second one 100 dB There however noise though pushes combination distortions noise 88 dB resulting SINAD amount positive This puts S300 amplifier median power amplifiers tested farOur frequency response bit variable high endI looked 300AS1 response shown inset consistent While us wont hear rise response show load dependency means speaker interact differentlyAll tests use AES17 filter flat response 40 kHz beyond But purposes finding actual highbandwidth spectrum unit I take test 1 kHz tone 5 wattSwitching frequency around 450 kHz fine Typical many classd modules level high 15 dB signal DonH56 recently asked level switching noise tracks signal I decided test upping power good bit 180 watts see happensAs see blue good news bad news Good news level doesnt scale output power much Bad news spectrum becomes quite wide total energy may increased much Certainly scary eye likely ear Anyway back regular programming signal noise ratioNot good 5 watt could predicted SINAD dashboard At full power situation improves still competitive top class switching amplifiers clock high 125 dB So careful sensitive speakersMost important graph amplifiers power versus distortionnoise Here 4 ohmWe tons good power tune 256 watts Distortion starts rise early though 10 wattsHere response 8 ohmPerhaps revealing happens perform sweep different frequencies starting 20 kHz working way 20 Hz An ideal amplifier would graphs landing top But get hereAt frequencies 1 kHz graphs indeed nicely land top But 5 kHz higher get odd responses indicating multiple nonlinearities taking turn dominate I thought issue PS Audio implementation response shown ICEPower data sheetPeak power shows disappointing level headroom available short durations would typical musicThe switching power supplies classd amplifiers tightly regulated means power get steadystate get peak Standard class AB amplifiers tend variable supply rails dont tax much maintain higher voltage produce power short bursts For reason may want get powerful class D amplifier replace class AB ampConclusionsIt sigh relief PS Audio managed reduce performance ICEPower modules Response sonic abilities completely determined modules unlike PS Audio marketing says The ICEPower module used distinctly lower performance Hypex modules tested past So going get stateoftheart performance For need go amplifiers higher SINAD graphStill competent wellbuilt wellsupported amplifier based proven amplification modules within Build quality much higher DIY garage shop amplifiers using Hypex modules 1500 ton money given attributes For reasons good looks unit I going put PS Audio Stellar S300 amplifier recommended list
