0, Buckeye Hypex NC502MP based 6channel amplifier It was kindly purchased and drop shipped to me by our dear moderator AdamG247 I dont know what it costsNot sure what there is to say about the caseOr the back panelOther than the fact that it has trigger switch and that the XLR connectors are upside down You need to use two hands to unlock and then pull out the cable And heaven help you if you dont know there is a locking tab underneath and you keep trying to yank out the cable anyway In use the amplifier is very robust going into and out of protection with no shut downs  Note however that once it starts to clip there is a high pitch whine from the power supply inductorsAmplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started my testing with the amplifier module all the way to the left in the picture above  Here is our warm up graphWas glad to see the unit stabilize in a couple of minutes so I did not have to wait forever Once there here is our dashboardI dont know what is going on with the channel in blue producing a lot more power supply noise  Grounding made no difference As a result one channel is 3 dB better than the other Averaging the two still lands the amp into our upper tier of all amplifiers tested to dateDespite the power supply issue above signal to noise ratio is excellent and superb if driven to max powerFrequency response shows no sign of load dependency which can be common in class D amplifiersMultitone test gets polluted by the aforementioned power supply interferenceCrosstalk was not as good as I expected although in grand scheme of things it is not badLets see how much power this thing can pump out starting with 4 ohm loadWe have more distortion than I like but that comes with a ton more power than our more accurate but less powerful amplifiers Allow 1 distortion and we get even moreVery impressive considering that you have 6 channels in this lightweight enclosureAs noted power did not increase when I split the measurement between two independent modules at each end of the case This indicates we are amplifier limited not power supply Switch to 8 ohm we get better noise and distortion although the main issue is still thereMultichannel PerformanceI thought I was all set for measuring more than 2 channels only to find out the balanced cables I had bought had the wrong gender  So all I could do was drive 3 channels at onceWhat you see is the same stereo pair measured with and without the extra channel also being driven  There is no impact at all which makes sense as these are independent modules and nothing but the power cord is shared between themLooking for consistency between the modules I measured each one separatelyConclusionsWhile still way ahead of countless amplifier designs the Hypex NC502MP modules are built more for power than ultra low distortion Not a bad compromise considering the fact that running out of power is quite audible and rise in distortion probably not Beauty of class D amplification is showcased by Buckeye in producing six times 600 watts of amplification in a light and compact case I will do a teardown later but so far I am happy with what is there sans the upside down XLR connectorsEDIT Teardown posted always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
