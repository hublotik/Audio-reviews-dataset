0, Masters Series M32 DirectDigital   Usually before I test an amplifier I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour This thermally stresses an amplifier with a conventional classAB output stage but as the NAD is a classD design this wasnt appropriate Even so before doing any testing I ran it for an hour at a moderate power level to ensure that it was fully warmed up Because classD amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slewrate limiting all  with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHzLooking first at the analog inputs With the NADs volume control set to its recommended maximum of 00dB the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 261dB from the speaker terminals an input of 140mV producing an output of 1W into 8 ohms The headphone output offered an insertion loss of 02dB 1kHz at 1V was reproduced as 975mV Increasing the volume setting to 10dB increased the gain by exactly 10dB The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  and the input impedance was 10k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly to 94k ohms at 20kHzThe headphone output impedance was a very low 1 ohm With the M32s output optimized for 4 ohm loads the output impedance at the speaker terminals was 017 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz but was slightly negative at 20kHz presumably due to the behavior of the necessary lowpass filter The action of this filter can be seen in fig1 where a peak that develops at the top of the audioband increases into higher load impedances The output is flat into 4 ohms  and starts to droop into 2 ohms  The peak is highest with our standard simulated loudspeaker  Optimizing the M32 for other impedances—as well as 4 ohms the other settings are 2 8 and 8 ohms—flattened the topoctave response for the selected load but increased the height of the peak when the actual load impedance was higher than the nominal setting Fig1 NAD M32 analog input 4 ohms setting frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 NAD M32 analog input frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with 2 ohms setting  4 ohms setting  8 ohms setting  8 ohms setting  I was puzzled by the overall shape of the traces in fig1 which cut off sharply above 20kHz But when I looked at the M32s reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave  I remembered that the amplifier digitizes its analog inputs and that Id set the converters sample rate to its lowest setting 48kHz The analog line inputs can also be digitized at 96 or 192kHz Fig4 shows the M32s frequency response into 8 ohms with the amplifier optimized for 4 ohms and with all three sample rates you can see that the output filters peak reaches its maximum between 30 and 40kHz with sharp rolloffs just below half of each of the two lowerfrequency ratesFig3 NAD M32 analog input smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig4 NAD M32 analog input 4 ohms setting frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with ADC sample rate set to 192kHz  96kHz  48kHz  Fig5 shows the effect of the M32s bass and treble controls set to their 10dB and –10dB positions and with the converter sample rate set to 96kHz The bass control offers a range of ±10dB below 40Hz the treble control 10–9dB at 20kHz Channel separation was good rather than great at 70dB in both directions below 2kHz but decreasing to 50dB at 20kHz Without the AP lowpass filter and with no signal present about 260mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the speaker outputs With the filter the analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to 00dB the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured a disappointing 37dB due to 415mV of residual ultrasonic noise Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to a respectable 735dB and an Aweighting filter increased it further to 866dB  Levels of any residuals at the AC powerline frequency and its harmonics were negligible Fig5 NAD M32 analog input 4 ohms setting frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with Bass and Treble controls set to 0dB 10dB and –10dB  Fig6 NAD M32 analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The M32 is specified as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 150Wpc into 8 ohms  or 4 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive the M32 delivered 190Wpc into 8 ohms  and 180Wpc into 4 ohms  Distortion levels at moderate powers were very low and although the shape of the spuriae waveform at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  is obscured by highfrequency noise the distortion signature appears to be primarily secondharmonic in nature This was the case even at high powers into 4 ohms  Though higherorder harmonics are visible in this graph they all lie at or below –100dB  Intermodulation distortion at high powers was relatively low even into 4 ohms  However the noise floor begins to rise above 10kHz and there is some peculiar spectral content present around 5kHz though this is extremely low in levelFig7 NAD M32 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig8 NAD M32 analog input

analog input spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100Wpc into 4 ohms Fig11 NAD M32 analog input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms The phono input preserves absolute polarity and appears to be digitized at a fixed rate of 48kHz It offers a maximum gain of 6175dB at the speaker outputs which is appropriate for movingmagnet cartridges The input impedance was also appropriate for MM cartridges at 45k ohms at 29Hz 39k ohms at 1kHz but 16k ohms at 20kHz The RIAA error was both very low and well matched between channels  though some odd ripples are apparent in the midtreble The phono inputs audioband SN ratio ref 1kHz at 5mV was excellent at 715dB this improving to 834dB when AweightedFig12 NAD M32 phono input response with RIAA correction The phono inputs overload margins were also excellent at 16dB across the audioband and both harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion were extremely low However some odd lowlevel spectral content was again apparent in the midtreble regionA 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in an output level of 1034V into 8 ohms with the volume control set to 00dB which suggests that the M32s gain architecture is well organized The AESEBU and coaxial and optical TosLink inputs on the MDC DD SPDIF module all locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz Apples AudioMIDI app indicated that the USB input accepted 24bit integer data with sample rates up to 192kHz Apples USB prober utility identified the amplifier as the M32 from NAD and indicated that the USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous modeThe NADs impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing to either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the M32s response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression by half the sample rate  An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  cant therefore be seen though the noise floor starts to rise in the top audio octave and continues to rise at ultrasonic frequencies The distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor the second harmonic being the highest in level at –64dB Fig13 NAD M32 digital input impulse response Fig14 NAD M32 digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz When NADs digital frequency response with SPDIF data at 441 96 and 192kHz the results were the same as shown in fig4  When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor dropped by almost 24dB meaning that the M32 offers 20 bits worth of resolution which is excellent With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical With undithered 24bit data the result was a clean sinewave Fig15 NAD M32 digital input 4 ohms setting frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Fig16 NAD M32 digital input spectrum

input waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit data With fullscale data representing equallevel tones at 19kHz and 20kHz  intermodulation products are relatively low in level but the rise in the noise floor in the top octave is visible The NADs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit AESEBU data  was superb with all the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave at the correct levels  With 24bit JTest data  no jitterrelated sidebands were present above –130dB  via the AESEBU coaxial SPDIF and USB inputsFig19 NAD M32 digital input HF intermodulation spectrum
