0, Soulution 710 I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  I ran the 710 at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour which maximally stresses a classAB amplifiers heatsinking At the end of this preconditioning period the amplifiers top panel was only slightly warm at 90°F The voltage gain into 8 ohms was 259dB from both the balanced and unbalanced inputs and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  The XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 hot The unbalanced input impedance was the specified 10k ohms at all frequencies However the balanced input impedance was 2860 ohms which is both low in absolute terms and significantly lower than the specified 48k ohms Tube preamplifiers with a high balanced source impedance are best avoided though it is fair to say that such preamps are rareThe output impedance including the series resistance of 6 of speaker cable was very low at 006 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 0075 ohm at 20kHz The variation in the amplifiers frequency response due to the interaction between this impedance and how that of the speaker varies with frequency is therefore also very low at ±007dB  Into 8 ohms  the Soulution 710 offered a very wide smallsignal bandwidth—note the superb channel matching in this graph—which correlated with the very short risetimes of the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  though there was the slightest hint of overshoot The ultrasonic output rolled off a little faster into lower impedances but even into 2 ohms the output was still flat within the audioband and down 3dB at 160kHz  The 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms was about as good as it gets Fig1 Soulution 710 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Soulution 710 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Soulution 710 smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was superb at 110dB below 1kHz and still 84dB in both directions at 20kHz The Soulution is also a very quiet amplifier its unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio measuring 83dB ref 1W into 8 ohms Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the SN ratio to 94dB and switching in an Aweighting filter further increased it to 968dB The Soulution 710 joins that select group of amplifiers that has sufficient dynamic range to match the best highresolution recordingsDespite the very low noise level any distortion present in the 710s output remains below that noise almost to the point where the amplifier clips Figs 4 and 5 plot the percentage of THDnoise against output power at 1kHz into 8 and 4 ohms respectively the constant downward slope of the traces in these graphs indicates that the THDN percentage is dominated by noise If clipping is defined as when the percentage of THDN reaches 1 the Soulution 710 with both channels driven clips at 130Wpc into 8 ohms  and 218Wpc into 4 ohms  With just one channel driven the clipping power was 135W into 8 ohms  260W into 4 ohms  and 490W into 2 ohms  The amplifier meets or exceeds its specified 130W into 8 ohms and 260W into 4 ohms  but only with one channel driven This is because I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests it was 1215V AC with the amplifier quiescent dropping to 1201V AC with the amplifier clipping both channels into 4 ohms or one channel into 2 ohmsFig4 Soulution 710 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Soulution 710 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsSoulution specifies the THD at 50W into 8 ohms which is equivalent to 20V so that is the level at which I plotted the THDN percentage The results are shown in fig6 the THDN in the midrange and bass into both 8 and 4 ohms is an astonishingly low 00006 This does rise at higher frequencies and into 2 ohms but not to any level that would cause concernFig6 Soulution 710 THDN vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms With a 1kHz signal I had to raise the output level close to clipping in order to see the distortion spuriae  These are predominantly thirdharmonic in nature but even after averaging 64 waveform captures the trace is still overlaid with noise  The spectrum of the signal is shown in fig8 The third harmonic is the highest in level at –114dB  with the second harmonic in the left channel and the fifth in the right lying at –120dB  along with a powersupply component at 120Hz The Soulution 710 performed equally well on the highfrequency intermodulation test With an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 85W into 8 ohms  the 1kHz difference components lay at –120dBFig7 Soulution 710 1kHz waveform at 101W into 8 ohms  000056 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Soulution 710 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 101W into 8 ohms Fig9 Soulution 710 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 85W peak into 8 ohms The following sentence appeared in a review of the Soulution 710 published in October 2005 in the German magazine Stereo Lab chief technician Rolf Hähle has hung the test certificate for the Soulution 710 in a golden frame over his measuring desk I wouldnt go quite that far but the Soulution 710 is definitely one of the bestmeasuring amplifiers I have encountered Color me impressed
