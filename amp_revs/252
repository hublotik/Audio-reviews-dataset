0, AIYIMA A07 Pro stereo amplifier  costs about 90As you see the distinguishing factor from some of the other Aiyima amplifiers is inclusion of tone controls Alas that is also where the problem is with this unit there is no detent and no way of setting its response to flat Worse yet small changes in the dials will make large differences in tonality So while I like having toner controls I definitely like to see a tone defeat feature Otherwise the unit feels nice to use and operate As is typical the power supply is much larger than the amplifier itselfAIYIMA A07 Pro MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into a pure 4 ohm load driven to stereo at 5 wattsWe expect good performance from AIYIMA and we get itSwitching to my PowerCube Loadbox we can simulate more complex loads As you see performance is essentially the sameNoise performance is good enough for this class of budget amplifiersMultitone shows good performanceFrequency response unfortunately is load  dependentSo you may be forced to use the treble control to adjust high frequency response for your speakerCrosstalk is very goodLets get into all important power measurements starting with 4 ohmThis is plenty for desktop use Switching to 8 ohm naturally robs us of fair amount of powerFortunately vast majority of speakers on the market are 4 ohm nominalTo see stability of the amplifier lets subject it to suite of loads and reactive componentsAn ideal amplifier would follow the red line We are essentially there for both 8 and 4 ohm Surprisingly this little amp managed to also keep running at 2 ohm albeit without capacitive component and some power drop Many amps simply shut down and wont even work into 2 ohmEdit here is the response vs frequency that I forgot to post originallyFinally here is the warm up profileIn use the amplifier ran pretty coolConclusionsThe AIYIMA A07 Pro continues the tradition of the company providing competent levels of noise and distortion good bit of power and very reasonable price While tone controls are a nice added feature they lack a defeat switch And we have our usual load dependencyPersonally I very much dislike the lack of tone control defeat so wont buy it But if that doesnt bother you then the AIYIMA A07 Pro is another good bargain in stereo amplification
