0,As I usually do with power amplifiers  Marantz SM11S1 Reference by running both channels at onethird the maximum measured power into 8 ohms for one hour Thermally this maximally stresses an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage At the end of that period while the wire grilles set into the top panel were hot the chassis was barely warm The Marantz has adequate heatsinking for an amplifier of its rated power In addition the measured THDnoise percentage didnt change through the preconditioning indicating a stable design topology The LCD power meter on the front panel was quite accurate indicating 488W with the amplifier driving a measured 485Wpc into 8 ohms The meter also takes impedance into account halving the impedance from 8 to 4 ohms almost doubled the indicated powerThough it can be bridged for mono operation  Marantz in stereo mode which is how Michael Fremer listened to it The SM11S1s gain can be adjusted over a range of ±6dB The amplifier was set to its factory default for the review indicated on the meter as Gain  0 in this condition the voltage gain into 8 ohms was significantly lower than the norm at 2235dB from the balanced inputs and 227dB from the unbalanced inputs both figures slightly lower than the specified 230dB The unbalanced input preserved absolute polarity the balanced input inverted polarity however confirming that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 3 rather than pin 2 hot  The unbalanced input impedance was a little lower than specified at around 18k ohms across the audioband dropping very slightly and inconsequentially to 172k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input offered twice these values as expectedThe SM11S1s output impedance was very low at 008 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising slightly to 011 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction between this impedance and that of the loudspeaker is below ±01dB  The amplifiers output into 8 ohms is down by less than 2dB at 200kHz  but the smallsignal bandwidth does decrease slightly into lower impedances Even so in the worst case into 2 ohms  the output at 20kHz is down by just 02dB That this is indeed a wide bandwidth design is confirmed by the SM11S1s excellent reproduction of 1kHz and 10kHz squarewaves Fig1 Marantz SM11S1 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Marantz SM11S1 smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Marantz SM11S1 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was excellent at better than 90dB in both directions below 2kHz though this decreased to 70dB at 20kHz The Aweighted signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms and measured with the input shorted was to specification at 1016dB It worsened to 638dB with a wideband unweighted measurement due to the presence of some lowlevel HF noiseSpecified as delivering 110Wpc into 8 ohms or 220Wpc into 4 ohms  the SM11S1 easily exceeded those figures on the test bench not clipping  until 140Wpc into 8 ohms  and 230Wpc into 4 ohms  The manner in which the THDN percentage changed with output power into these two loads is shown in fig4 the distortion is extremely low at all levels below clipping and actually lies beneath the noise floor below 10W The amplifier went into protection with sustained delivery of more than 230Wpc into 4 ohms so I didnt repeat this test into 2 ohms Plotting how the THDN figure changes with frequency  revealed a large increase in measured THD into 2 ohms  suggesting that this amplifier is indeed uncomfortable driving loads of less than 4 ohmsFig4 Marantz SM11S1 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  4 8 ohmsFig5 Marantz SM11S1 THDN  vs frequency at 1315V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms To be certain that I was looking at distortion rather than noise I performed this test at the relatively high voltage of 1315V which is equivalent to 215W into 8 ohms however the Marantz offers very low levels of distortion 0002 in the midrange and bass into both 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  The distortion plots show the usual rise in the treble due to the amplifiers finite openloop bandwidth reducing the amount of corrective negative feedback at higher frequencies but the level remains below 001 The left channel was very slightly worse in this respectInto higher impedances the content of that distortion is predominantly the benign second harmonic  though the third harmonic make a stronger appearance as the output current increases  Even so both the second and third harmonics lie at or below –100dB  and though some higherorder harmonics can be seen these are 10–20dB lower still Despite the decrease in linearity seen above 5kHz in fig5 the levels of intermodulation products produced with the amplifier driving the demanding 11 mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible waveform clipping on an oscilloscope were very low  As expected from fig5 however the level of the 1kHz difference tone in the left channel  was a little higher than in the right Fig6 Marantz SM11S1 1kHz waveform at 485W into 8 ohms  00103 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig7 Marantz SM11S1 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 63W into 8 ohms Fig8 Marantz SM11S1 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 123W into 4 ohms Fig9 Marantz SM11S1 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 60W peak into 8 ohms Overall the Marantz SM11S1 Reference offered a very clean bill of health on the test bench It was a pleasure to measure an amplifier so competently designed
