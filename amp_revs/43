0,Other than  appended to the name on the amplifiers top and bottom plates the Brooklyn AMP appears identical to the original Brooklyn AMP that was reviewed in the September 2018 issue I summed up the earlier amplifiers behavior on the test bench by writing Myteks Brooklyn AMP is a tiny powerhouse offering respectable measured performance I used my  system  to test the Brooklyn AMP Like its predecessor the AMP has an output stage operating in classD so I inserted Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter between the test load and the analyzer This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slewrate limiting and I used it for all the tests other than frequency responseThe Brooklyn AMP is specified as having a voltage gain of 23 or 29dB selectable with one of the rearpanel DIP switches  The voltage gain into 8 ohms measured very close to the specification at 229dB and 289dB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs In Bridged mode the gain was 6dB higher in both gain settings as expectedBoth sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  in Normal mode and the Bridged mode was noninverting when the positive output was taken from the left channels positive output terminal The input impedance was 198k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz for the balanced inputs and 17k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz for the unbalanced inputs the latter dropping slightly at 20kHz to 15k ohms The output impedance in Normal mode including a 6 spacedpair speaker cable was very low at 0085 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz but rose to 03 ohms at 20kHz As a result the modulation of the Brooklyn AMPs frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was very small in the audioband  Into 8 ohms  the response peaked by 09dB between 40kHz and 50kHz before rapidly rolling off to reach –3dB at 80kHz  The ultrasonic peak which is due to the passive lowpass filter that follows the amplifiers classD output stage was absent into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  The response into 2 ohms was down by 07dB at 20kHzFig1 Mytek Brooklyn AMP frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  The ultrasonic peak into higher impedances is associated with a slight degree of leadingedge overshoot with a 10kHz squarewave  but the overshoot is critically damped with no ringing evident Channel separation was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 73dB at the top of the audioband Without the AP lowpass filter there was 98mV of ultrasonic noise present on the Myteks output which is significantly lower than with the original Brooklyn AMP which had 315mV of noise present With the AP filter the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the singleended inputs shorted to ground was 785dB  ref 1W into 8 ohms The SN ratio improved to a very good 84dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 868dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit Other than the inevitable ultrasonic noise produced by a classD design this is a quiet amplifier Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor  revealed no ACsupply–related harmonicsFig2 Mytek Brooklyn AMP smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision AUX0025 lowpass filterFig3 Mytek Brooklyn AMP spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Myteks website specifies the amplifiers maximum power as 250Wpc into 8 ohms  300Wpc into 4 ohms  and 400Wpc into 2 ohms  Defining clipping as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1  clipping power with both channels driven into 8 ohms as 265W  However when I tried to measure the clipping power into 4 ohms the Mytek went into protection mode at 2104Wpc into 4 ohms  Similarly the AMP went into protection mode at 1037W into 2 ohms  In both cases the amplifier turned itself on again as soon as I reduced the level of the input signalFig4 Mytek Brooklyn AMP distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Mytek Brooklyn AMP distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI examined how the Brooklyns THDN percentage varied with frequency at 20V  The THDN was extremely low in the bass and midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  with the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in openloop voltage gain as the frequency increased Note the higher level of distortion with the right channel driving 4 ohms  than the left  This graph doesnt show how the THDN percentage varied into 2 ohms as the amplifier went into protection at this output voltageFig6 Mytek Brooklyn AMP THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms The THDN waveform at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  suggests that the distortion signature is primarily third harmonic in nature This was confirmed by spectral analysis of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  The third harmonic was a little higher in the right channel  but the second and higherorder harmonics all lay at or below –100dB  As implied by fig6 when I drove the 50Hz tone at the same voltage into 4 ohms the third harmonic increased in level in the right channel but was still relatively low at –74dB Fig7 Mytek Brooklyn AMP 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0003 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Mytek Brooklyn AMP spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig9 Mytek Brooklyn AMP spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Despite the decrease in topoctave linearity shown in fig6 when tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones and the signal peaking at 100Wpc into 4 ohms the Mytek produced low levels of intermodulation distortion  The difference product at 1kHz lay at –94dB  in the left channel  and at –100dB  in the right channel  The higherorder intermodulation products all lay close to or below –80dB Fig10 Mytek Brooklyn AMP HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms Like its predecessor Myteks Brooklyn AMP is indeed a tiny powerhouse It matched the measured performance of the original Brooklyn AMP in most ways but with a wider smallsignal bandwidth and a lower level of ultrasonic noise Even with its hairtrigger protection circuit it will offer sufficient power into lowimpedance loudspeakers with music signals
