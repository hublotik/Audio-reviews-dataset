Classé Sigma 2200i Out box I ran problems Despite Classés excellent manual I couldnt first define one Sigma 2200is digital inputs accept USB data Eventually I got input behave defining input turning amplifier back Then I couldnt get Sigma 2200i accept balanced signal input marked XLR L1R1 But I remembered I setting USB input onscreen menu Id select specific input connector input case USB Checking setup menu XLR input set prior user accept signal unbalanced Line 2 RCA jacks Once Id set accept signal fed balanced XLR jacks well—except amplifier went standby running 19 minutes The manual says A
