0, SMSL SA100 Stereo Audio Amplifier with analog and Bluetooth inputs It was kindly sent to me by the member lunagreenjp who is a distributor for SMSL The SA100 costs just US 7399 on Amazon including shippingForm the outside the SA100 matches its sibling the M100 DACPushing the power button multiple times lets you select between Aux RCA in and Bluetooth Pushing and holding the volume control lets you select Bass and Treble amounts I was surprised that the unit had shipped with both set to max instead of zeroThe volume control works well and overall you feel like you are getting more than the 74 price indicatesHere is the back panelAn external laptop style switching supply powers the unit It is almost as large as the SA100 itself although not as thickI was pleased that my rather large and unwieldy banana speakers securely mated with the jacks on the SA100Overall my impression is positive about the look and feel of this little and I mean little integrated amplifierThe heart of the unit is TPA3116D2 classD amplifier IC from Texas Instruments I suspect it is made for Bluetooth speakers and such In use the SA100 ran cool no matter how hard I pushed itAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm loadAs is typical of amplifiers with volume control one can get slightly different results depending on how you set the input level relative to volume control on the unit itself The above is with volume control set to 1 I thinkHigh distortion dominates the output resulting in one of the worst numbers we have measured with respect to SINAD Frequency response droops at both end someThe sharp drop after 20 kHz tells me that input is perhaps digitized to provide tone controlSignal to noise ratio OK for the classMeasuring distortion and noise relative to output power with 8 and 4 ohm gets usDistortion sets it very early and climbs after that Specified power ratings are quite inflated as is typical of these chip ampsThe sharp filter limit the measurement of harmonic distortion when we sweep frequency and power levelThe red curve for example is for 20 kHz but since we cant see any of its harmonics it looks artificially lowHere is the spectrum of a 1 kHz tone without any kind of filter Speaking of filter even though I used an AES17 filter to get rid of ultrasonic noise the level was still so high as to confuse my Audio Precision analyzer It would often not be able to capture the input signal properlyConclusionsIf we measured the SMSL SA100 on an absolute level it would rank horribly of course But I dont think that is proper here The SA100 costs so little and probably gets use in tertiary applications such as a workshop amp to drive cheap speakers you dont mind getting stolen or destroyed And maybe for casual desktop use
