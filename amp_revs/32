0, NAD C 328   Because classD amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slewrate limiting all  with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHzLooking first at the linelevel analog inputs With the NADs volume control set to 00dB the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 256dB from the speaker terminals and 12dB from the headphone terminals Increasing the volume setting to 12dB increased the gain by exactly 12dB from both sets of outputs The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  and the input impedance was 15k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly to 144k ohms at 20kHzThe headphone output impedance was a low 116 ohms at all audio frequencies and the response was flat to 200kHz The output impedance at the speaker terminals was 01 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising very slightly to 012 ohm at 20kHz The output is flat into resistive loads  rolling off above the audioband to reach –3dB at 45kHz and any modulation of the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was within ±005dB  The yellow and magenta traces in this graph show the response with Bass EQ activated The low frequencies peak by just over 6dB at 80Hz then roll off rapidlyFig1 NAD C 328 analog input frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  8 ohms with Bass EQ engaged  The C 328s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  reveals a slight critically damped overshoot with no ringing apparent Channel separation was excellent at 90dB in both directions between 800Hz and 2kHz though this decreased at the frequency extremes to 78dB at 20Hz and 63dB at 20kHz Without the AP lowpass filter and with no signal present about 212mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the speaker outputs With the filter the analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to 00dB the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured a superb 843dB Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 9275dB and an Aweighting filter increased it further to 95dB  Levels of any residual spuriae at the AC powerline frequency and its harmonics were extremely low  but spurious tones were present at 280 and 720Hz Although these are very low in level I was surprised to see themFig2 NAD C 328 analog input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 NAD C 328 analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The C 328 is specified as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 40Wpc into 8 ohms  or 4 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive in both channels the C 328 exceeded its specification delivering 50Wpc into 8 ohms  and 56Wpc into 4 ohms  Distortion levels at moderate powers were very low and were consistent with both frequency and load impedance  Although the shape of the spuriae waveform at 15Wpc into 8 ohms  is obscured by highfrequency noise the distortion signature appears to be primarily secondharmonic in nature  Though higherorder harmonics are visible in this graph they all lie at or below –100dB  Intermodulation distortion at high powers was extremely low even into 4 ohms  There is some peculiar spectral content present around 5kHz though this is still very low in levelFig4 NAD C 328 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output

Fig9 NAD C 328 analog input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 20Wpc peak into 4 ohms The phono input preserves absolute polarity and offers a maximum gain of 62dB at the speaker outputs which is appropriate for movingmagnet cartridges The input impedance was also appropriate for MM cartridges at 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 395k ohms at 20kHz The RIAA error was both very low and well matched between channels  The phono inputs wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1kHz at 5mV was excellent at 599dB this improving to 73dB when AweightedFig10 NAD C 328 phono input response with RIAA correction The phono inputs overload margins were also excellent at 17dB across the audioband and both harmonic distortion  and intermodulation distortion  were extremely low However some odd lowlevel spectral content was again apparent in the midtreble regionFig11 NAD C 328 phono input spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 5mV input Fig12 NAD C 328 phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz The C 328s SPDIF inputs preserved absolute polarity and locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz A 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in an output level of 10V into 8 ohms with the volume control set to 00 which suggests that the digital inputs have 6dB too much gain ie a digital signal at –6dB will just drive the amplifier into clipping into 8 ohms This extra gain may well be useful with lowsensitivity headphones howeverThe NADs impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing to either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the C 328s response rolled off sharply above 20kHz but didnt reach full stopband suppression until above the Nyquist frequency of 2205kHz An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  can therefore be seen though this lies at –90dB  However the noise floor rises a little in the top audio octave and above The distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor the third harmonic being the highest in level at –74dB Fig13 NAD C 328 digital input impulse response Fig14 NAD C 328 digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz When C 328s digital frequency response with SPDIF data at 441 96 and 192kHz the response followed the same basic shape with a sharp rolloff just below the two lower sample rates  When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor dropped by almost 20dB meaning that the C 328 offers more than 19 bits worth of resolution which is excellent However a slight modulation of the noise floor can be seen in the midtreble with 24bit data  With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical With undithered 24bit data the result was a clean sinewave Fig15 NAD C 328 digital input frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Fig16 NAD C 328 digital

Fig18 NAD C 328 digital input waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit SPDIF data The NAD offered relatively low levels of intermodulation distortion via its digital inputs  though the noise floor to either side of the highlevel tones at 19 and 20kHz had a scalloped appearance This same scalloped noise floor made an appearance when  C 328s rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit TosLink JTest data  It obscures the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave and lowlevel sidebands can be seen at powersupply–related frequencies as well as a higherlevel pair of sidebands of unknown origin at ±17kHzFig19 NAD C 328 digital input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 0dBFS 441kHz data Fig20 NAD C 328 digital input highresolution jitter spectrum of

of good measured performance in an inexpensive package
