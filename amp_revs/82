0, Vincent SV737   I first preconditioned the amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the top panel was warm at 1046°F  and the heatsinks hotter at 1139°F  I then performed my usual thermal stress test by running the amplifier at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of this time the heatsinks temperature had risen to 1213°F  The Vincent amplifier has enough thermal capacity for its power rating though due to the significant biasing of its output stage into classA it runs warm Be sure to give this amplifier sufficient ventilationI looked first at the Vincents performance via its line inputs The maximum gain at the speaker was 343dB into 8 ohms which is a little lower than usual for an integrated amplifier The maximum gain at the unbalanced preamplifier outputs was 954dB and at the headphone jack it was 351dB Measured at the power amplifier inputs which bypass the preamplifier section the gain was 355dB into 8 ohms The amplifier inverted absolute polarity at the loudspeaker outputs but preserved it at the preamplifier and headphone outputsThe singleended line input impedance was lower than the specified 47k ohms but was still relatively high at 227k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 217k ohms at 20kHz The power amplifier input impedance was closer to the specification at 454k ohms The preamplifier output impedance was a low 90 ohms in the midrange and treble rising to 121 ohms in the low bass presumably due to the presence of a coupling capacitor The headphone output impedance was a very high 805 ohms across the band This output will work best with highimpedance headphones like Sennheisers The Vincent amplifiers output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was a low 009 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 018 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore minimal  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was down by 3dB just above 100kHz which correlates with the Vincents accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum neither the frequency response nor the excellent channel matching changed at lower settings of the volume control The response at the preamplifier and headphone outputs was identical to that from the speaker outputs The Treble control offered close to 8dB boost and cut in the high treble the Bass control offered 11dB boost or cut in the midbass and below Fig1 Vincent SV737 volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 Vincent SV737 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Vincent SV737 frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum and switched out of circuit Channel separation was good at 80dB R–L and 90dB L–R below 2kHz but closer to 60dB at the top of the audioband The Vincents unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the unbalanced line inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum was okay at 675dB ref 283V into 8 ohms  This ratio improved to 77dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 80dB when Aweighted The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its even and oddorder harmonics  but these are all relatively low in levelFig4 Vincent SV737 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms volume control set to maximum The SV737s nominal power is specified at 180Wpc into 8 ohms  and 300Wpc into 4 ohms  With clipping defined as the point at which the THDnoise reaches 1 the SV737 clipped with both channels driven at 155Wpc into 8 ohms  However the relatively high level of distortion at lower powers puzzled me Fig5 was taken with the left channel I repeated the test with the right channel The result is shown in fig6 While the clipping power into 8 ohms is still 155W the distortion at lower powers is significantly lower than it had been in the left channel Fig7 shows that the right channel clipped at 240W into 4 ohms  Though this is again lower than the specified power I dont hold the wall voltage constant during the testing it had dropped to 117V with the amplifier clippingFig5 Vincent SV737 left channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Vincent SV737 right channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 Vincent SV737 right channel distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI examined how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms Though the right channels distortion was very low in the bass and midrange into both 8 ohm and 4 ohm loads  and rose only slightly into 2 ohms  the left channels distortion was close to 01 into all three impedances  The distortion was predominantly the subjectively benign second harmonic  but was very much higher in the left channel  than the right Fig8 Vincent SV737 THDN  vs

spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms As the Vincents preamplifier and power amplifier sections can be operated independently I repeated the spectral analysis shown in fig10 by driving the power amplifier directly The result is shown in fig11 Though the left channel still has higher distortion than the right the distortion is now very low in both channels The left channels much higher distortion in figs5 and 8 must therefore be generated in the preamplifier circuit It is possible that one of the smallsignal tubes in the review sample was not performing to specification but it is fair to point out that 01 of secondharmonic distortion is exceedingly difficult perhaps even impossible to hear with musicFig11 Vincent SV737 power amplifier input spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms When the SV737 drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W peak into 4 ohms very few intermodulation products were present but as expected these are higher in the left channel  than the right  While the difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB  in the left channel compared with –90dB  in the right channel this is still relatively low in levelFig12 Vincent SV737 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms The Vincent SV737s optical and coaxial SPDIF digital inputs locked to data sampled up to 192kHz  and preserved absolute polarity at the preamplifier and headphone outputs but polarity was inverted at the loudspeaker outputs With the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in a level at the loudspeaker outputs of 356V which is equivalent to 1584W into 8 ohms This is just above the clipping power into this impedance and the waveform on the oscilloscope screen was visibly squared off The level at the headphone output with a 1kHz signal at –12dBFS was 3687V and at the preamplifier output it was 188V As often appears to be the case with contemporary integrated amplifiers the SV737s digital inputs appear to have around 13dB of excess gain To avoid damaging the Vincents power amplifier stage with highlevel digital signals I performed all the measurements of the digital inputs performance at the preamplifier output and with the volume control set to –12dBThe digital inputs impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a minimumphase type with all the ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the SV737s response rolled off above 20kHz but had not reached full stopband suppression at half the sample rate  and there is some unusual scalloping of the ultrasonic noise floor An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  lies at –55dBFS and the distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are higher in the left channel  than the right  This confirms that the left channels distortion is occurring in the Vincents preamplifier stage The SV737s digitalinput frequency response was flat in the audioband and follows the same basic shape at all sample rates up to 192kHz with then a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate Fig13 Vincent SV737 digital input impulse response Fig14

ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor components dropped by around 12dB which implies that the SV737s digital inputs offer 18 bits worth of resolution With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved With undithered 24bit data  the result was a somewhat noisy sinewaveFig16 Vincent SV737 digital input spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Fig17

distortion via the Vincent amplifiers digital inputs was a little higher than it had been for analog input signals  with some aliased images visible  SV737 for its rejection of wordclock jitter via both its TosLink and coaxial SPDIF inputs The oddorder harmonics of the 16bit JTest signals LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were mostly obscured by the analog noise floor but where they are visible they are higher than the correct levels  With 24bit JTest data  jitterrelated sidebands were present at ±229HzFig19 Vincent SV737 digital input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 0dBFS

which will be specific to this sample Vincents SV737 offers relatively high power with low harmonic and intermodulation distortion The digital inputs and headphone output however should be regarded as more for convenience than for absolute performance Footnote 1 I wasnt able to test the performance with the Bluetooth input
