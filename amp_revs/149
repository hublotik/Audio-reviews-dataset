0, Rogue Audio Pharaoh II  As the Rogues output stages operate in classD all the measurements other than frequency and RIAA responses were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which reduces the level of noise above 80kHz and eliminates noise above 200kHz Without the filter 376mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the loudspeaker terminals with a center frequency of 428kHzLooking first at the linelevel inputs the Rogue Pharaoh II preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting from its loudspeaker output with both balanced and singleended inputs but inverted polarity from the headphone output With singleended input signals the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was 37dB from the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms and 214dB from the headphone output The gains with the balanced input were 6dB lower rather than the usual 6dB higher The balanced input impedance was a very high 380k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and still very high at 310k ohms at 20kHz The singleended input impedance was still usefully high at 285k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 235k ohms at 20kHzThe headphone outputs source impedance was a low 1 ohm across the audioband The loudspeaker output impedance was very low at 005 ohms at low and middle frequencies increasing very slightly to 0075 ohms at the top of the audioband The variation in the Rogue amplifiers smallsignal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore less than ±01dB  Into resistive loads  the Pharaoh IIs frequency response was down by 1dB at 25kHz Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum and the balance control centered The right channel was 02dB higher in level than the left this slight imbalance was the same at lower settings of the volume control The Pharaoh IIs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  showed only the slightest hint of overshoot with no ringingFig1 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Pharaoh IIs channel separation  was 70dB in both directions below 1kHz but decreased to 36dB R–L and 40dB L–R at 20kHz Taken with the AUX0025 filter installed the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  was 642dB  This ratio only improved by 1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and by another 2dB when AweightedSpectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the Rogue amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum  revealed a relatively high level of ACrelated spuriae at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics which will be due to magnetic interference from the large toroidal power transformer perhaps entering via the steel pins of the 12AU7 input tubes Setting the volume control to –12dB  reduced the levels of these spuriae by approximately the same 12dB which means that the noise pickup occurs before the volume control Repeating the spectral analysis with the balanced input  reduced the levels of these supplyrelated spuriae by the same 6dB as the reduction in gain with this inputFig3 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum  and to –12dB  Rogue specifies the Pharaoh IIs maximum power as 250Wpc into 8 ohms  and 400Wpc into 4 ohms  both powers equivalent to 24dBW With our usual definition of clipping—when the THDnoise reaches 1—I measured clipping powers of 240Wpc into 8 ohms  and 380Wpc into 4 ohms  with both channels driven  The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the measured THDN is dominated by noise below 2W and that the amplifier uses a limited amount of loop negative feedback presumably given the high linearity of the NCore output stage in the tubed stageFig4 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 shows how the percentage of THDN in both channels varied with frequency into 8 and 4 ohms at 20V equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms  and 100W into 4 ohms  The THDN was close to 02  across the audioband into both load impedances This level of distortion might be audible if it was comprised of highorder harmonics like the 5th and 7th Fortunately the distortion waveform was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  Intermodulation distortion even at high powers was relatively low with the 1kHz difference product produced by the Pharaoh II driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms lying at –60dB  The higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were much lower in levelFig6 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig7 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II left channel 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 019 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with

4 ohms  behavior of the Rogues phono input I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the Rogues rear panel to obtain the lowest noise The phono input inverted absolute polarity at the headphone output in both MM and MC modes but preserved polarity at the loudspeaker outputs The maximum gain at 1kHz at the speaker outputs was 768dB  and 975dB  At the headphone output the maximum gain was 612dB  and 819dB  I performed all the subsequent testing using the headphone output and other than SN ratio with the volume control set to –20dB in order to avoid clippingWith the input impedance set to 47k ohms I measured 47k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz With the impedance set to 1000 ohms I measured 986 ohms across the audioband set to 300 ohms the impedance was 302 ohms and set to 100 ohms it was 101 ohms The phono inputs audioband RIAA error was very low in the right channel  though a little higher above 2kHz in the left channel  The low frequencies rolled off below 80Hz reaching –3dB at 20HzFig10 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II phono input response with RIAA correction  With the MM phono input the wideband unweighted SN ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a very good 741dB in both channels ref 1kHz at 5mV Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 75dB while an Aweighting filter further increased the ratio to 80dB The SN ratios in MC mode were 20dB lower but this is still a relatively quiet phono stageMeasured at the headphone output the phono inputs overload margins were relatively high at all audio frequencies 16dB in both MM and MC modes ref 1kHz at 5mV for MM and ref 1kHz at 500ÊV for MC The phono distortion signature was pure second harmonic lying at –60dB  with the nominal MM input level of 1kHz at 5mV  The level of the 1kHz difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones  was similar to that with the line inputs though highorder intermodulation products were much lower in levelFig11 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz for 5mV input measured at headphone output Fig12 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II MM phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz for 100mV input measured at headphone output The Rogue Audio Pharaoh IIs measured performance indicates that it resembles an intriguing marriage between a lowdistortion lownoise highpower classD output stage and a higherdistortion highernoise tubed input stage At the time of writing I had not seen HRs review Ill be interested to read his take on the Pharaoh IIs sound character
