0, Crown XLi 800 pro Power Amplifier The XLi 800 costs just US 269 including free shipping Hard to imagine so much electronics from a brand name company selling for so littleNOTE my company  is a dealer for Harman and sells a lot of Crown amplifiersEDIT I left out the letter B out of class AB below I dont know anyone who is building class B audio amplifiersUnlike some of the switching amplifiers from Crown this is a class AB amplifier with seemingly linear power supply as it is quite heavy From the outside though it look like countless other commercial amplifiersThere are two gain controls in addition to very useful clipping indicators Speaking of clipping there is a compressor in there that limits power output to maximum no matter how much you increase its input It is a nice feature that is surely there to stop the amp from stressing while saving a speaker from blowing up due to a mistake upstreamThe back panel is as you expectIn use the unit never even got warm I had headphones on so did not take note of whenif the fans came onAmplifier Audio MeasurementsLets see how the XLi 800 does in our usual dashboard at 5 watt output into 4 ohm using a 1 kHz toneOuch We have very high distortion of 013 to 016 The spec is 05 so it is within what they say but this is very high Translated into SINAD  our 57 dB value sinks into the bottom range of all amplifiers measured so farSignal to noise ratio at 5 watt is nothing to write home about eitherFrequency response is fairly flat and predictablePower into 4 ohm relative to THDN gives usThat is a lot of power And tremendous value at just 50 cents per watt As one would predict we lose some of that into 8 ohmDetermining maximum power and peak with 1 THDN gives us theseWe have fair bit of headroom thereI had a hard time measuring power across full spectrum at a given THDN due to the amp limiting power  Only managed to capture 09 and 05 THDN power hereAs we would expect we get less power at low frequencies because they tax the power supply more Oh the text on graph is wrong should say 1 not 01Finally here is our frequency sensitivity relative to power and distortionnoiseBest distortion is usually at lower frequencies and here the improvement is quite good at 20 Hz Alas we also get less power before clipping Otherwise the lines are quite predictable with no funny nonlinearity mid span as we get with some amplifiersConclusionsCrown advertises the XLi 800 as a PA  amplifier and that is what it is Distortion and noise is kept in check just enough to do the job with tons of power for so little money I suspect it is reliably too given the dual fans to keep it cool And the market it is being sold intoFor hifi use it is not something I would consider to drive fullrange speakers For subwoofer or active woofer duty it would be fineAs it is I cant recommend the XLi 800
