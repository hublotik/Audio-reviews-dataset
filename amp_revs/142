0, Pass Laboratories INT60    amplifier by running it with both channels driven at onethird power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes This is thermally the worst situation for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage as onethird power is when the output transistors dissipate the most heat At the end of the hour the highest temperature on the sidemounted heatsinks was 1147°F  and that on the top panel which was highest toward the rear was 1071°F  The THDnoise measured a constant 0084 throughout this hourThe volume control operated in accurate 1dB steps and the voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum measured 286dB for both balanced and unbalanced input signals Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  The input impedance was usefully high measuring 90k ohms balanced and 75k ohms unbalanced at low and middle frequencies The impedance dropped slightly at the top of the audioband to 80k ohms balanced and 34k ohms unbalanced but these are still high in absolute termsOverall the INT60s measured performance suggested that its circuit uses a modest amount of negative feedback so I wasnt surprised to find that its output impedance was relatively high for a solidstate design 016 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 035 ohm at 20kHz  Nevertheless the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker was fairly low at ±018dB  Pass Labs specifies the INT60s frequency response as being down by 6dB at 80kHz Fig1 confirms that figure there being a reduction in output of just 025dB at 20kHz The shape of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  had slightly slowed risetimes but with commendable absences of overshoot and ringing Figs 1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum of 63 there was no difference in the performance with the control set to 40 and the excellent channel matching seen in fig1 was maintained at the lower settingFig1 Pass Labs INT60 frequency response with volume control set to its maximum at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Pass Labs INT60 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation at 1kHz was excellent at 96dB R–L and 104dB L–R and at 20kHz was still respectively 80 and 87dB The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  taken with the input shorted to ground but the volume control set to 63 was 765dB This increased to 84dB with an Aweighting filter spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor while the INT60 drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms revealed the presence of some lowlevel supplyrelated spuriae  These were not affected when I experimented with the ground connection between the INT60 and the Audio Precision test system Those spuriae at 60Hz and its odd harmonics which will be due to magnetic interference from the power transformer are higher in the right channel  perhaps because that channels circuits are closer to the transformer—but none of the spuriae are anywhere close to high enough to approach audibilityFig3 Pass Labs INT60 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The INT60 is specified as delivering 60Wpc into 8 ohms  at 1 THDN as shown in fig4 our sample clipped at 79Wpc with both channels driven into that load  The distortion begins to rise out of the noise at around 2W and the gentle rise in THDN above that power suggests that only a modest degree of negative feedback is used Into 4 ohms  the amplifier clipped at 125W  a slightly higher power than the specified 120Wpc while with one channel driven into 2 ohms  the INT60 clipped at 200W Fig4 Pass Labs INT60 THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Pass Labs INT60 THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Pass Labs INT60 THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThe Pass Labs was less comfortable driving 2 ohms than it was with higher impedances as shown by fig7 which plots the percentage of THDN against frequency into 8 4 and 2 ohms at a fairly high level 1265V equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms 40W into 4 ohms and 80W into 2 ohms Note that with the limited amount of negative feedback used the distortion rises in the upper octaves—although as highlevel content above 10kHz is very rare in music this decreasing linearity shouldnt affect sound qualityFig7 Pass Labs INT60 THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms At low frequencies the predominant distortion harmonic is the subjectively benign second  though at 1kHz the third harmonic rises higher in level than the second  Despite the increase in its harmonic distortion in the top octave the INT60 did relatively well on the punishing highfrequency intermodulation test even at a fairly high power into 4 ohms  The secondorder or difference component resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lies at a respectably low –67dB  though the higherorder components at 19 and 21kHz are a little higher in level at –60dB Fig8 Pass Labs INT60 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20W into 8 ohms Fig9 Pass Labs INT60 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms 008 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Pass Labs INT60 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20W into 8 ohms Fig11 Pass Labs INT60 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms As I have come to expect from Pass Laboratories the INT60 offered respectable measured performance that included a careful balance of the consequences of the limited amount of negative feedback used Im a little suspicious of the change from predominantly second to thirdorder harmonic distortion as the frequency rises as I feel that amplifiers that maintain a constant distortion signature sound better However its as fair to concede that I have no actual evidence that that is true in this case as it is to note that Herb Reichert loved the INT60s sound
