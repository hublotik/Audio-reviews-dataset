0, Exposure XM5 integrated amplifier and DA processor   Usually before performing any testing I run an amplifier for an hour at onethird power into 8 ohms which is thermally the most stressful condition for a design with a classAB output stage With the Exposure XM5 however I cut short this preconditioning after 15 minutes The temperature of the amplifiers bottom panel to which the output devices are fastened had already reached 1636°F  and I was concerned that the XM5 would go into thermal runaway The top panel was also hot at 1051°F  Clearly this little amplifier doesnt have enough heatsink capacity for sustained operation at highish powers The owner should ensure that its well ventilatedLooking first at the linelevel analog inputs With the volume control at its maximum setting the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 36dB from the speaker terminals 1206dB from the preamplifier outputs The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  from both outputs The input impedance was 147k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly to 124k ohms at 20kHz The preamplifier output had an appropriately low output impedance of 68 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz but this rose to 430 ohms at the bottom of the audiobandThe output impedance at the speaker terminals  was a low 009 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 055 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modulation of the Exposures frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±005dB  The amplifiers output is down by 05dB at 20kHz and rolls off above 30kHz which lengthens the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  However there is no overshoot or ringing Note the excellent channel matching in fig1 taken with the volume control set to its maximum Commendably the matching was preserved at lower settings of the control as was the frequency responseFig1 Exposure XM5 line input volume control at max frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Exposure XM5 line input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe XM5s channel separation was modest at 63dB in both directions from 100Hz to 20kHz With the line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured 807dB  Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 831dB in the left channel 878dB in the right and an Aweighting filter increased both ratios by another 4dB Fig3 shows the lowfrequency spectrum of the XM5s output while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms The highestlevel spuriae are at the AC powerline frequency of 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics presumably due to magnetic coupling from the power transformer In so small an enclosure the lowlevel circuitry cant be kept far enough away for this not to occurFig3 Exposure XM5 line input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Exposure specifies the XM5 as delivering a maximum power of 60Wpc into 8 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive in both channels the XM5 exceeded that spec delivering 70Wpc into 8 ohms  With both channels driven into 4 ohms the amplifier clipped at 106W  I didnt test the clipping power into 2 ohms as I was concerned the amplifier would overheatFig4 Exposure XM5 line input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms both channels drivenFig5 Exposure XM5 line input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms both channels drivenI looked at how the XM5s THDN percentage varied with frequency at a level of 693V which is equivalent to 6W into 8 ohms 12W into 4 ohms and 24W into 2 ohms The distortion levels were very low in the bass and midrange in both channels into 8 ohms  though with the usual rise at higher frequencies due to the circuits decreasing openloop bandwidth However while the right channel performed almost as well into 4 ohms  the left channel offered higher distortion  and even greater levels into 2 ohms  The shape of the distortionspuriae waveform in the right channel  suggests that the second harmonic was the highest in level but with higherorder harmonics present Spectral analysis indicated that this was the case into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  but that the third and fifth harmonics were the highest in level in the left channel  Both secondorder and higherorder intermodulation products at 20Wpc into 8 ohms were very low in level  perhaps due to the amplifiers restricted ultrasonic bandwidthFig6 Exposure XM5 line input distortion  vs frequency at 693V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Exposure XM5 line input 1kHz

line input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 40Wpc peak into 4 ohms Turning to the XM5s digital inputs the optical SPDIF input locked to datastreams with sample rates up to 96kHz the coaxial inputs up to 192kHz All digital inputs preserved absolute polarity Apples USB Prober utility identified the XM5 as xCOREAUDIO HiRes 2 from XMOS and confirmed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the USB port could handle 16 and 24bit integer data at all sample rates up to 192kHz With the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in output levels of 128V at the preamp outputs and 201V into 8 ohms at the speaker outputs The latter is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms which is 14dB below the measured clipping power into this load As is often the case with integrated amplifiers offering digital inputs these have around 10dB too much gain compared with the linelevel analog inputs I continued testing the Exposures digital inputs from the preamplifier outputs with the volume control set to 12 oclockThe XM5s impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that its reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the response rolled off above the audioband reaching full stopband suppression at 24kHz The aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  is suppressed by 83dB though harmonics of this tone can be seen with the second the highest in frequency at –57dB  The Exposures digital frequency response with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHz follows the same basic shape at each sample rate with a sharp rolloff with 441kHz data  The response at the two higher sample rates rolls off earlier than expected presumably due to the amplifiers limited ultrasonic bandwidthFig10 Exposure XM5 digital input impulse response Fig11 Exposure XM5 digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig12 Exposure XM5 digital input frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Channel separation for the digital inputs was better at lower frequencies than that of the analog inputs It measured 76dB below 1kHz though it decreased to 50dB in both directions at the top of the audioband When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor dropped by about 12dB meaning that the XM5 offers around 18 bits worth of resolution However these spectra reveal a lot of supplyrelated spuriae With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was symmetrical though some HF noise was present With undithered 24bit data the result was a slightly noisy sinewave Fig13 Exposure XM5 digital input spectrum with

digital input waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit TosLink data Intermodulation distortion via the XM5s digital inputs was low  When  digital inputs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit JTest data the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were all at the correct levels  However many other sidebands are visible these spaced at 120Hz intervals which suggests that they might be due to an insufficiently filtered voltage at the DAC chips reference pinFig16 Exposure XM5 digital input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 0dBFS into 100k

frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzAs I was finishing these jitter measurements the Exposure XM5 overheated and shut down I had to let it cool down before I could examine the phono inputs behavior For this I floated the analyzer outputs and ran a separate ground connection from the speaker binding post next to the amplifiers phono input RCAs which gave the lowest level of noise With the volume control at its maximum setting the voltage gain at 1kHz measured 788dB from the speaker outputs and 549dB from the preamplifier outputs these gains appropriate for movingmagnet cartridges Both outputs preserved absolute polarity with phono input signals The phono input impedance was 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly to 39k ohms at 20kHz these impedances also appropriate for MM cartridgesThe phonostage RIAA error was low in the treble but featured a 07dB plateau in the midrange and a lowfrequency rolloff reaching –3dB at 13Hz  Fig18 also reveals a slight  imbalance in favor of the left channel With the phono inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to 12 oclock the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured a good 64dB in both channels An Aweighting filter increased the ratios to 70dB in both channels Phonoinput overload margins were good at lower frequencies at 15dB at 20Hz and 12dB at 1kHz but dropped to 97dB at 20kHz Both harmonic distortion  and intermodulation distortion  were very low in level even at input levels 6dB higher than usualFig18 Exposure XM5 phono input response with RIAA correction  Fig19

good measured performance though I was less impressed by the performance of its digital inputs
