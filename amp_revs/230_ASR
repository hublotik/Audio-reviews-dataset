Audiophonics DAS250NC class D amplifier stereo DACBluetooth It requested supplied company It costs 58250 € I really like front panel display It large font super responsive rotary encoder delight use The power switch input selections feel good well Back panel shows fact digital inputs providedIn use unit robust operation recovered automatically overloadsAudiophonics DAS250NC DAC MeasurementsUsing preout performance DAC Lets start dashboardI surprised I could get 08 volt preout Like see 2 volts Likely optimized gain setting integrated amplifier Distortion 110 dB output level rather low noise drags SINAD 103 dB This still competent performanceSNR good enough 16 bit contentLinearity near perfectMultitone quite good get upper registersIMD vs level shows impact noise levelThere regular pulses 1 KHz USB subpacket buffer sizeI tried changing filter settings seemingly made differenceMight well fine choice anyway Attenuation could better hurting THDN vs frequencyOverall performance DAC bad Question good enough impact amplifier performanceAudiophonics DAS250NC Amplifier MeasurementsUsing USB input I measured performance setting front panel volume control 165 dB get 5 watts change outputThis good performance landing amplifier well average products ever testedZooming inNoise performance good almost meeting 16 bit minimum SNR 5 wattsFrequency response nice doesnt show load dependencyCrosstalk better average amps testedMultitone test shows good performance almost frequency dependencyI could barely get amplifier clip max digital inputvolume controlThis tells could bit output voltage DAC drive amplifier This impacts 8 ohm moreNote want operate clipping region bit power left table far measurements concernedSince amplifier barely distorts I could run standard max peak power using 1 THD metric I dial 03 get max powerI able run burst power due issue Note good thing amplifier doesnt distort enough get burst powerLets switch load 8 2 ohm also changing phase angle represent capacitive inductive loadsI impressed handled 2 ohm 60 degrees capacitive Output voltage dropped though dont get keep doubling Likewise lose output voltage extremes ± 60 degrees 4 8 ohmFinally I suspected get double power glitch amp DAC powering sequence resulting noiseConclusionsThe DAS250NC caught eye moment I looked website The combination DAC class D amplifier makes sense people want digital input Many smart amplifiers exist domain usually compromised Seeing DAC married hypex amplifier combined nice front panelremote seemed ticket In testing DAC performance good seems mating well enough amplifier Any performance would kind wasted So I cant complain much A version higher performance DAC amplifier would dandy Overall I like recommend Audiophonics DAS250NC
