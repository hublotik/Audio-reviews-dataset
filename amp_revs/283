0, SMSL A100 A100 stereo amplifier  a member I cant find it on sale anywhere but seems to have cost US 100I like the simply but rather elegantsymmetrical design Same for thoughtful rear connectionsAlmost every manufacturer puts both speaker outputs together making it so hard to plug in the banana plugs Here they are spaced apart which essentially solved that problem Inclusion of an AC power supply is unheard of in this price class and nicely declutters your deskOddly the USB input is type A At first I thought this was for external storage but manual talks about using this with a computer I didnt have a type A to type A cable so didnt test this and stuck with Aux analog inputThe heart of the unit is Infineon MA12070 class D amplifierSMSL A100 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboardDistortion is actually better than 90 dB but there is rising level of noise and high order spikes which drag it down to 76 dB This puts is slightly below averageEditRequest was made to measure using USB input I had to use a special breakout box to interface to the unit given its type A connector Here is the dashboardAs you see performance is degrade fair bit My breakout may be causing some clock jitter but then again if async USB is implemented this should not be the caseNoise performance is OKMultitone shows the same problem at high frequenciesI expected frequency response to have load dependency but thankfully it did notWhat ringing it has is above audible band which is goodCrosstalk is very good beating some home amplifiersPower output is naturally modestSensitivity to high frequency input becomes very clear as we do power sweepsUnit didnt need any warm upConclusionsThe message here is a sum of good and not so good I really like the frequency response for a class D amplifier and inclusion of AC power supply Distortion on the other hand rises with frequency I like to see perfection but we dont have such an example below 350 currently Overall I would say not a bad attempt Strange that despite having become available late last year it is discontinued already Maybe there are part shortagesI am going to recommend the SMSL A100 as a budget amplifier As always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
