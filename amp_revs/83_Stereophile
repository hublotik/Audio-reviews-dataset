The D 3020 voted Stereophiles Budget Component 2014 Getting review sample onto test bench todo list way long I reminded unfinished task I picked PS Audio Sprout measurement Herb Reichert whose review latter appears elsewhere issue I first checked performance D 3020s digital inputs looking signal headphone output jack The headphone output preserved absolute polarity analog digital input signals
