0, Unison Research Unico Primo   As always before performing any measurements on an amplifier running it with both channels driven at onethird power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes Thermally this is the worstcase situation for an amplifier with a classB or classAB output stage as onethird power is when the maximum heat dissipation occurs in the output transistors As the Unico Primos maximum power is specified in the manual as 80Wpc into 8 ohms I set it driving 27Wpc into 8 ohms However the amplifier turned itself off after just 15 minutes at this power level The two green LEDs on its front panel were slowly flashing which according to the manual meant that the amplifiers protection circuitry had detected thermal overload The internal heatsinks temperature was 1132°F  which didnt seem that hot But I turned the Primo off and let it cool down for 30 minutes after which I could turn it on againThis preconditioning test puts a significant strain on inexpensive amplifiers which tend to have undersized heatsinks it appears that the Unico Primo is not the best candidate for use at partiesI looked first at the phono input which Ken Micallef had used with the default movingmagnet setting Measured at the Tape Out jacks this preserved absolute polarity  and offered a gain of 405dB The input impedance measured 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly to 396k ohms at the top of the audioband and both the gain and impedance are appropriate for MM cartridges Fig1 shows the RIAA error The two channels match closely and while there is a slight rise in the top two octaves and a slight rolloff below 30Hz both are low in absolute terms The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio measured with the input shorted to ground and ref 1kHz at 5mV input voltage was excellent at 69dB increasing when Aweighted to 793dB left and 805dB right The phono inputs channel separation was also excellent at 80dB above 2kHzFig1 Unison Unico Primo phono input response with RIAA correction  The MM stages overload margin was superb at 26dB at all audio frequencies this equivalent to an output voltage of 95V at the Tape Out jacks Harmonic distortion was correspondingly low at typical MM signal levels with the third harmonic of a 1kHz tone the highest in level at a very low –97dB  Intermodulation distortion was similarly low in level Fig2 Unison Unico Primo phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 2V peak into 100k ohms Turning to the line inputs the Unico Primos maximum gain into 8 ohms measured 40dB which is typical for an integrated amplifier these inputs also preserved absolute polarity The input impedance was a usefully high 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping inconsequentially to 42k ohms at 20kHz At 03 ohm the Primos output impedance was on the high side for a solidstate design presumably due to the low level of loop negative feedback As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker reached ±025dB  This graph reveals that the Unison amplifier had a wide smallsignal bandwidth even into 2 ohms  but the 10kHz squarewave  shows no overshoot or ringing Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum turning down this control also reduced the amplifiers bandwidth but the response was still flat to 20kHz at the lower settings and the excellent channel balance seen in fig1 was preservedFig3 Unison Unico Primo frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig4 Unison Unico Primo smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation for a 1kHz linelevel signal was a little disappointing at 65dB R–L and 70dB L–R and decreased with increasing frequency reaching a poor 40dB at 20kHz I also noted significant interinput crosstalk at –30dB at 1kHz for adjacent unloaded inputs The unweighted wideband SN ratio measured with the line inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum was also disappointing at 684dB ref 283V into 8 ohms though when Aweighted this did improve to 828dB left and 793dB right Fig5 reveals that the noise floor is dominated by spuriae at the AC mains frequency of 60Hz and its harmonicsFig5 Unison Unico Primo spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Fig6 reveals that the Unico Primo exceeded its specified maximum output power of 80Wpc into 8 ohms  clipping  at 105Wpc  However into 4 ohms  the output voltage dropped the amplifier clipping at 135Wpc  which suggests that its power transformer is undersized While performing this test I noted that at levels above 20W or so the transformer audibly buzzed which suggests the same thing These two graphs indicate that the THDN level remains relatively constant over a wide range of powers from 100mW to 10W but that the amplifier becomes more linear as the output current increasesFig6 Unison Unico Primo THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 Unison Unico Primo THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI plotted how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at a level 895V  where I could be sure that I was examining actual distortion rather than noise The results are plotted in fig8 The rise in THD in the top two octaves is lower than usual suggesting that the circuit has a wide openloop bandwidth The distortion also remains relatively constant over the range of impedancesFig8 Unison Unico Primo THDN  vs frequency at 895V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The distortion signature at 1kHz and low powers appears primarily to be thirdharmonic in nature  but at higher powers the second harmonic and higherorder odd harmonics make appearances  The graph of intermodulation distortion  looks a little alarming but other than the products at 18 and 21kHz the spuriae are all at or below 70dB Fig9 Unison Unico Primo 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms 01 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Unison Unico Primo spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20W into 8 ohms Fig11 Unison Unico Primo HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms Some of its measured behavior suggests that some corners have been cut to keep the Unison Research Unico Primos price relatively affordable But despite its disappointing levels of noise and distortion the Unico Primo appears to maintain a relatively constant level of performance over a wide range of frequencies and power levels which is always found subjectively to be a good thing
