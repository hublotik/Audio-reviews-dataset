five channel Classe Sigma AMP5 It kindly sent originally cost US 5000 I see one ebay 1900 right nowThis one heavy amplifier class D architectureAt first I thought linear power supply transformer reason behind weight Alas looking reviews pictures inside uses switching power supply So weight enclosure likely thick front plateAt first I hoping glossy front logo LCD display VU meters But It looks I must say highend products go attractive relative high cost enclosure It sharp corners niceThe back shows quality selection partsI like staggered speaker binding posts makes easier plug things XLR connections I like see amp price range This amp mated processor time I suspect discontinued longer ampAmplifier MeasurementsI tested two channels using XLR input Here dashboardRather high second third harmonics dominate causing overall ranking middle roadNice see precise channel matching thoughFrequency response showed unexpected resultsResearching I found analog digital converter explains sharp cut I thought meant DSP functions none Instead digital signal used part protection circuit I see parallel path main path compromising response way This amp came 2015 like didnt higher sample rates available least go 48 kHz get us flat audible responseSignal noise ratio middle road wellCrosstalk OK betterPower vs distortion shows odd response 4 ohm gets worse 8 ohm Very strange noise response start multiple sources distortion take causing nonlinearities On positive front healthy amount power Not much available though burst mode Here power 8 ohmThat step function quite bizarre Worst measurements came bandwidth increased 45 kHz frequency sweeps usedNo way amplifier well behaved Instead I think high amplitude noise masking distortion present We see perform wideband frequency analysisWe see sharp increase noise right audible band This either caused noise shaping ADC Amp explains previous graphThere naturally switching spikes I disappointed level 8 dB fundamental I like see 20 dB attenuation ConclusionsThis custom Class D design switching power supply Classe It clearly shows deficiencies design creating market Hypex come show class D done Digitizing input good idea user benefit none hereWe could get depressed look copious amount power amplifier produces remaining cool Since lack power 1 reason amps sound bad I going put enough emphasis give failing gradeOverall I neutral Classe Amp5 At current sale prices 400 per channel 400 watts power It may hard match Hypex amp decide worth
