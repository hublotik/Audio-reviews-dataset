0,All of the No333s  using the balanced inputs After a onehour 13power preconditioning the heatsinks were too hot to keep my hands on The wideband SN Ratio  measured a reasonable 625dB this improving to 795dB when Aweighted The channel separation  was better than 90dB below 5kHz decreasing above that frequency to a stillgood 70dB at 50kHz due to capacitive coupling between the channels The amplifiers voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 267dB it didnt invert polarity and its input impedance was approximately 100k ohmsThe output impedance was low at around 0037 ohms in the bass and midrange rising to 0046 ohms at 20kHz meaning that the frequency response driving our simulated loudspeaker load  was effectively identical to that into a resistive load  However note the ultrasonic response rise peaking by 17dB at 100kHz This is related to the overshoot and damped ringing visible on the 333s squarewave response  both are due to a minor problem with the feedback circuit I didnt note anything untoward in my auditioning however so I must assume that this measured behavior is benign Fig1 Mark Levinson No333 balanced mode frequency response at 1W into 8 ohms Fig2 Mark Levinson No333 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsIt may also be related to the manner in which the THDnoise varies with frequency  Although the distortion reading at these low power levels is very low note the slight rise both at higher frequencies and into lower loads I suspect however that this behavior is due to the amplifier starting to run out of closedloop gainmargin at high frequencies It too is probably benign Fig4 shows that even at high powers into 8 ohms the harmonic content is primarily thirdharmonic with noise At high powers into lower impedances  some higher harmonics appearedFig3 Mark Levinson No333 THDnoise vs frequency at  4W into 2 ohms 2W into 4 ohms and 1W into 8 ohms Fig4 Mark Levinson No333 1kHz waveform at 132W into 8 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out The No333s output spectrum driving a lowfrequency tone  at 232W into 4 ohms is shown in fig5 The dominant harmonic is the third at 150Hz though this is still at a very low –90dB At higher powers and into lower impedances the fifth harmonic makes an appearance Note that the only ACsupply harmonic evident in this graph is the 120Hz at a low –98dB The Levinson output spectrum driving a mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones into a 4 ohm load remained relatively clean until very high power levels Even at 30V RMS with this difficult signal  the 1kHz difference component was almost 100dB down and the 18kHz and 21kHz intermodulation products were almost 80dB downFig5 Mark Levinson No333 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 232W into 4 ohms  Note that the third harmonic at 150Hz is the highest in level at –90dB Finally the No333 outperformed its power specification in a big way As can be seen from fig6 it clipped  at 400W into 8 ohms  with both channels driven and a wall voltage of 117V This almost doubled to 700Wpc into 4 ohms  with both channels driven and almost doubled again at 1250W into 2 ohms  one channel driven Note that the AC line voltage drooped to 114V for these last two measurements implying that with a stiff AC supply  the No333 will pump out even more watts Fig6 Mark Levinson No333 distortion  vs output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms and 2 ohms
