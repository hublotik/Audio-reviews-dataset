Neurochrome Modulus286 Power amplifier Kit company designer member tomchr It ship end month costs 1299 See may recall review Toms headphone amplifier Neurochrome designs strive low distortion good objective performance So I quite excited anxious measure one Toms power amplifiersFrom outside Modulus286 rather small chunky look massive heatsinks side unitThe heart Modulus286 solid state amplifiers Tom designs integrated LM3886 IC Texas Instruments I suspect National Semiconductor team though acquired TIThe LM3886 pretty powerful little IC capable producing 70 watts 4 ohm The Modulus286 uses pair get 100 watts power rating channel Typical mass market amplifier ICs though distortion rating nothing write home 002 In Toms design active feedback loop brings distortion way see measurementsThe LM3886 class AB amplifier unlike products tested use much efficient class D So LM3886 small requires pretty large heatsinks cool reason included Modulus286 But addition amplifier circuit another source size weight heat power supply Here Modulus286 deviates classic class AB designs using switching power supply gain size weight advantage You see center Modulus286It commercial switching supply Tom says customized useThe amplifier modules actually hard see side central power supply I tried take picture hardYou see two LM3886 ICs mounted heatsink bottom I sure better pictures Toms websiteSo lets get measurements see doesMeasurementsAs usual I start dashboard view 5 watts output case XLR balanced inputsSINAD breaks 100 dB barrier nice You see distortion 00009 orders magnitude better specified level TI I noticed lot mainspower supply noise one channel Nothing I would impact level I could also feel tingling sensation case indicates mains leakage This legal safe explain elevated levels Of course 110 dB audible since hearing poor low frequenciesNext important power versus distortionnoiseCompared best measured far Hypex NC400 Modulus286 nearly matches noise level On distortion one channel also tracks NC400 max power 95 watts This 0975 millivolts input Attempting feed strong signal would cause go protection I could quite get specified power ratingOne channel deviates though see light red better channel goes low 00007 THDN SINAD 103 Seeing max power nice figure arrive Performance basically noise dominated distortion shut downThe Hypex DIY NC400 power distortion starts rise Modulus286 stops It produces 226 watts point I marked blue So headroomFrequency response shows somewhat early roll offWe 04 dB 20 kHz Would nice see flatter seeing traditional class AB design Likely part computation keep amplifier stable different loads Of course audible concern us cant even hear 20 kHz let alone 04 dB drop Signal noise ratio quite goodBroadband spectrum analysis 1 MHz shows little concernWe see indication switching frequency power supply around 160 kHz level quite low nearly 100 dB With class D amplifiers see levels high 30 dB Note since class AB amplifier I NOT use AES17 filter testsI tested THDN versus frequency 6 different power levels see graphAs expected distortion rises higher frequencies At 97 watts Modulus286 could produce frequencies 1 kHz would enter protection mode indicated vertical lines orangeAt lowest power level dominated noise hence elevated line red That true power amplifierFinally crosstalk one channel Please take worst case response I testing amp using bunch wires everywhere impact crosstalk I need build dedicated module tight wiring tests like Regardless numbers like amply good enough far audibility concernedConclusionsThe Neurochrome delivers good power low distortion using combination active feedback offtheshelf amplifier IC Use switching power supply keeps costs size weight It produces nearly 100 watts clean power 4 ohm load Personally I like much power But subwoofers dont listen loud andor efficient loudspeakers fineI sure value judgement put amplifier Certainly 1300 Modulus286 amplifier cheap compared highend amplification At externe DIY Hypex NC400 I tested produced power I think 1500 Purchasing Neurochrome Modulus286 would let support smart Canadian designer entrepreneur I let decide valuable isOverall I recommend Neurochrome Modulus286 wellengineered product design faults
