0, Hypex NCx500 NCOREx reference design amplifier It was sent by the company and kindly assembled by our local expert Rick SykoraAs you see the sample is a monoblock configuration  driven by Hypex SMPS1200 switching power supply The only other board is the Ncore standard interface board  The gain as set is almost 12 dB EDIT see follow up below review for with buffer  performanceHere is a close upNote that this board includes a preamp  I am testing per above in unbuffered modeDuring use the amplifier as a whole was extremely stable and never changed its temperature nor did it go into protection mode A sole XLR connection is the input to the unit All fits in this nice compact boxHypex NCx500 Buffer Bypass Amplifier MeasurementsI let the unit warm up for a while but was not needed as it was stable as soon as powered upIt did reach a plateau around 11 minutes though as you see But note that the vertical scale is 01 dBNow on to our dashboard of 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm loadDistortion is provably inaudible at 120 dB A bit of noise sags that down to 113 dB which is still superb performance landing it at 2 best amplifier every testedNoise performance is exceptionalEven when listening to 16 bit content at 5 watts you have an extra 10 dB of noise margin This is one quiet amplifierFrequency response is wide and load invariant which is a great attribute not existing in all class D designsMultitone test shows off its low distortion yet againI must say I was not prepared for the amp to beat the reference Benchmark AHB2 in noise level in our power testEDIT I reran the power sweeps again with tighter load terminals which resulted in much lower distortion levels especially at 4 ohmDespite massive amount of power the NCx500 produces its distortion is now close to the best we have ever measuredI updated these max and peak measurements again which produced more powerCompany specs this power level even at 2 ohm so I tested thatThis is one powerful amplifierHere is our updated 8 ohm powerI was surprised how much lower its noise level is compared to Purifi 1ET400A reference design Maybe that amp was not running at such a low gain setting though  Still this is once again superb performanceSweeping with different frequencies we see various distortion mechanisms kicking in There is some rise in distortion with frequency but this is to be expectedFinally here is the pop on and off noises Keep in mind that this is a reference design and the onoff switch turns the whole unit on and on as opposed to soft powerHypex NCx500 Buffered MeasurementsAs noted there is integrated buffer  in this module I activated it which boosted the gain to 27 dB Maximum power is now achieved at around 22 volts which is well within the output of many well designed DACs using balanced out Here is our new dashboardDistortion has gone down a bit but we have picked up a bit of power supply noise Despite that hit performance is still state of the artAs noted SNR has gone down but still excellentMultitone is mostly the same but impacted by the power supply noiseFrequency response is the sameAs noted distortion is lowerOnOff noise is impacted a bitConclusionsHypex amplifiers have always enjoyed great performance in our testing It is wonderful to see the company innovating and increasing the performance of their high power NC500 platform You no longer have to compromise between available power and superb technical performance You can have bothIt is my pleasure to recommend the Hypex NCx500 OEM amplifier module Cant wait to see it show up in commercial designs As always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
