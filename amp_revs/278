0,This is a review and abbreviated measurements of the Linn Majik DS1 integrated streamer and amplification It has been discontinued but back in 2010  when it was announced it was US 4200 I see a recent ebay sale for a bit over 1000The Linn is an attractive unitThe interesting bits are in the backYou have full suite of analog and digital inputs although given the age USB input is lacking Roon remote is built into the networking which is very nice for an older device And of course you have full amplification in there for a single box solutionStreamer DAC Stereo MeasurementsSince there is line out lets use the Toslink input into its DAC and measure what comes out before the power amplifierBy todays standard this is definitely subpar with sum of distortion and noise relative to signal not close enough to beat the CD formatI tested streaming with Roon player and performance was identical which is goodAmplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started testing the power amplifier by using the Toslink optical input firstWe see sum total SINAD of 78 dB This obviously is NOT limited by the DAC as it produced 20 dB better performance Indeed switching to analog input we see that confirmedAs its the DS1 lies smack in the middle of rankings of all the amplifiers we have tested regardless of price I quickly ran a frequency response test using analog input and was quite surprised that it was not flatThinking it may be digitized I switched to digital input with both 441 kHz and 96 kHz samplingWe see the same curve So unless there is some kind of EQ I dont know about it is sad to see such roll offLets measure power into 4 ohmThis is very little power for all but secondary use It naturally drops lower with 8 ohm loadAnd these are not good watts either given how early distortion takes over and flattens the curve and then swings up at clippingConclusionsIn 2010 this kind of functionality would have been advanced But today there are a range of streaming solutions with amps that retail in hundreds of dollars with much more power It is disappointing to see an engineering focused company like Linn target so low in power and noise and distortionAnyway even at 1000 I cant recommend the Linn Majik DS1 That said if you have one using it in a secondary location like bedroom office etc would be fine
