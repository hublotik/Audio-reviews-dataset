0, Luxmans measured behavior I mainly used Stereophiles loaner sample of the topoftheline  system   I thermally stress it by running it for 60 minutes at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms which is the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage With its classA output stage the Luxman easily survived this ordeal at the end of the hour its chassis was warm but not so hot that I couldnt keep my hand on it In that time the THDnoise had risen from 0007 to 00089The M800As voltage gain into 8 ohms was 288dB for the balanced and unbalanced inputs The unbalanced input preserved absolute polarity  while the balanced input inverted polarity due to the XLR jack being wired with pin 3 hot and pin 2 cold the opposite of the AES standard At 43k ohms the unbalanced input impedance was insignificantly lower than specified at low and midrange frequencies though this did drop slightly at 20kHz to 32k ohms The balanced input impedance was to specification at 67k ohms at all frequenciesThe Luxmans output impedance was a little higher than usual for a solidstate design at 012 ohm at low and midrange frequencies rising to 016 ohm at the top of the audioband Even so any modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between its output impedance and the modulus of our simulated loudspeakers impedance remained within ±01dB  This graph also shows that the amplifiers bandwidth changes only slightly with load impedance the –3dB point lying at 80kHz into 8 ohms  and at 60kHz into 2 ohms  This was for the balanced input the unbalanced input had a wider bandwidth the response into 8 ohms lying at 120kHz  The Luxmans reproduction of a balanced 10kHz squarewave had slightly slowed leading edges  though there is no sign of overshoot or ringingFig1 Luxman M800A frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Luxman M800A smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was very good at 90dB in both directions at 1kHz though it did decrease to 70dB at the top of the audioband  The amplifiers wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  was modest at 527dB though this increased to an excellent 81dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and increased further to 835dB with an Aweighted measurementThe M800A is a lowdistortion amplifier Fig3 for example plots the THDN percentage against output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms The Luxman is specified as delivering a continuous 60Wpc into 8 ohms  at 0009 THDN  This is not the power at clipping however at 1 THDN  the M800A delivered no less than 160Wpc into 8 ohms  and 280Wpc into 4 ohms  both figures measured with both channels driven And while the rise in distortion above 50W in fig3 shows that the amplifier is clearly working harder than it probably likes to into 2 ohms it still manages to deliver 480W into that load  at 1 THDN with one channel drivenFig3 Luxman M800A distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsFig4 plots the THDN percentage present in the Luxmans output as it drives 8 and 4 ohm loads at an output voltage of 10V the level where fig3 indicates that the THD components begin to rise out of the noise floor The highfrequency rise in THD above the very low level in the midrange and bass is due to the circuits diminishing openloop bandwidth—there is less gain margin available for the negative feedback loop to do its distortionreducing thing Neither channel behaves appreciably differently as the load impedance is reduced from 8 ohms  to 4 ohms  However this plot was taken with the amplifier cold Once it had warmed up the midband distortion rose by a factor of four into 4 ohms Though the absolute level of the THD was still low this behavior was a little alarming as looking at the oscilloscope display the rise in THD into low impedances appeared to be due to a small burst of ultrasonic noise appearing on every positive peak of the waveformFig4 Luxman M800A THDN  vs frequency at 8V into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms I repeated the measurement once the amplifier had cooled down and it behaved perfectly again And again once it had heated up the ultrasonic noise appeared if I used the M800A to drive loads of 4 ohms or lower However now the M800A wouldnt drive 2 ohms without instability developing I checked my cables replaced my dummy load with another and repeated the measurement using the Audio Precision System One rather than the SYS2722 There was no change in the amplifiers apparent unhappiness at driving low impedances once it had warmed upThe main distortion component with the Luxman driving higher impedances was the subjectively benign second harmonic  However the left channel also offered some third harmonic  though its fair to note that both the second and third harmonics lie at very low levels and that no higherorder harmonics are present in this graph However a regular series of spuriae can also be seen at odd multiples of the AC mains frequency of 60Hz  particularly in the right channel All of these are at or below –105dB and so will be inaudible but they do suggest the presence of magnetic coupling between the M800As powersupply transformer and the audio circuitry Dropping the load to 4 ohms  doesnt affect the level of the AC spuriae but does increase the level of the harmonics particularly in the left channel  and the noise floor rises due to the bursts of noise accompanying the positive waveform peaks that I mentioned earlier affecting the measurementFig5 Luxman M800A 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms  00056 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 Luxman M800A spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 34W into 8 ohms Fig7 Luxman M800A spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 65W into 4 ohms Finally the M800As decreasing linearity at high frequencies leads to the appearance of some intermodulation products with the demanding 1920kHz signal  though these are still at a low level in absolute termsFig8 Luxman M800A HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 30W peak into 8 ohms Overall the Luxman M800A performed well on the test bench However given how well Michael Fremer found the amplifier to perform with his Wilson MAXX 2s I do wonder if our review sample had developed a possibly atypical problem regarding its relative misbehavior into lower impedances once it had warmed up Footnote 1 Although it doesnt say so in the M800As literature I suspect that this is the maximum power the amplifier will deliver in full classA At higher powers the output stage progressively transitions into classB operation until the amplifier eventually reaches its output voltage limit
