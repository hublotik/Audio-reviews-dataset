0,On its face the Ayre Acoustics EX8 20 Integrated Hub appears identical to the original EX8 that I reviewed in February 2019 However changes have been made to better allow the amplifier to drive low impedances   EX8 20   and repeated some of the tests with the magazines APx500 system ing I followed the CEAs recommendation of operating the EX8 20 at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that period its top panel was a little warmer than the EX8s had been at 1131°F  and the bottom panel which acts as the heatsink for the output devices was too hot to touch at 1336°F  Owners of the EX8 20 need to ensure that the amplifier is well ventilatedI started the measurements with the linelevel analog inputs With the volume control at its maximum setting the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 26dB from the speaker terminals for both balanced and unbalanced inputs Though this is low for an integrated amplifier there wont be any issues with regular linelevel source components The maximum gain from the singleended headphone output was 476dB for the balanced input and 45dB for the unbalanced input The maximum gain at the PreampSub outputs was 87dB for the balanced input to balanced output 24dB for unbalanced input to unbalanced output The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  from all outputs The unbalanced input impedance was 186k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping very slightly to 163k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced value as expected While these impedances are much lower than the specified values of 1M ohm unbalanced and 2M ohm balanced they are very similar to those of the original EX8 and high enough not to load down source componentsThe singleended headphone output impedance was an appropriately low 3 ohms at all audio frequencies The PreampSub output impedance was a stilllow 129 ohms unbalanced and 258 ohms balanced The left channels output impedance at the speaker terminals  was 035 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz This is slightly lower than that of the original EX8 but the right channels output impedance was higher at 0525 ohms The left channels output impedance resulted in a modulation of the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker of ±03dB  The response was flat to 20kHz into 8 ohms  rolling off above the audioband to reach –3dB above 200kHz The right channels level  was slightly lower than the lefts  presumably due to the higher output impedance Fig1 Ayre EX8 20 analog input volume control at max frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Ayre EX8 20 analog input volume control at max frequency response at 1V from singleended headphone output into 100k ohms  Figs1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum the response didnt change at lower volume settings However an imbalance developed in favor of the right channel at lower settings of the volume control reaching a maximum difference of 09dB at –20dB  The EX8 20s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  was superbly square with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringingFig3 Ayre EX8 20 analog input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 2kHz decreasing to 80dB at 20kHz due to capacitive coupling between the channels With the singleended analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured 7535dB  which is superb Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 862dB and an Aweighting filter increased it further to 8845dB As with the EX8 the levels of residual spuriae at the AC powerline frequency and its harmonics were very low particularly in the right channel Fig4 Ayre EX8 20 analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Like its predecessor the EX8 20 is specified to deliver a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  the Ayre delivered 107Wpc into 8 ohms with continuous drive in both channels  With both channels driven into 4 ohms the EX8 20 clipped at the specified 170Wpc  compared with the EX8s 125Wpc  The distortion was low below 1W into either impedance but rose at a few tens of watts then decreased slightly before actual waveform clipping occurredFig5 Ayre EX8 20 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms both channels drivenFig6 Ayre EX8 20 analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms both channels drivenLevels of distortion measured against frequency at 895V—equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms 20W into 4 ohms and 40W into 2 ohms—were respectably low into the two higher impedances  Notably the EX8 20 had significantly lower distortion than the EX8 at this voltage into 2 ohms  The THDN percentages into 2 ohms were lower than the left channels into 4 ohms  this was due to the fact that I could only measure one channel at a time into 2 ohms With both channels driven at 40W into 2 ohms the amplifier turned itself off halfway through the measurement because it detected excessive temperature according to the frontpanel display Putting the Ayre into sleep mode by pressing the lefthand button on the front panel for more than 3 seconds then turning it on again brought the amplifier back into operationFig7 Ayre EX8 20 analog input distortion  vs frequency at 895V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The shape of the left channels distortionspuriae waveform indicated that the EX8 20s harmonic distortion was predominantly third harmonic in nature  Spectral analysis indicated that the third harmonic was the highest in level in the left channel  the second the highest in the right channel  with higher oddorder harmonics present at lower levels in both channels Secondorder intermodulation distortion at moderate power into 8 ohms was very low the difference product at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at –96dB in the left channel and –86dB in the right  Higherorder products were present at higher levels and the level of the difference product at 1kHz increased to –73dB when I repeated the test at the same power level into 4 ohms Fig8 Ayre EX8 20 analog input 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms 0024 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with

locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz and preserved absolute polarity Apples USB Prober utility identified the EX8 20 as Ayre USB Interface from Ayre Acoustics with the serial number Streamlength  USB Prober confirmed that the EX8 20s USB port operates in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the EX8 20s USB port could handle 24bit integer data at all sample rates up to 384kHz A 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in an output level of 1846V into 8 ohms from the speaker outputs 246V from the balanced PreampSub outputs and 155V with the volume control at its maximum setting All of these are approximately 4dB below the clipping voltage from the outputs which suggests that the digital inputs have about 8dB too much gain However a menu item allows the maximum level for the digital inputs to be reduced in 6dB steps   digital inputs from the singleended headphone output and from the balanced PreampSub output with the level reduced by 8dB with the volume controlI havent discussed the EX8 20s performance via its digital inputs as this was identical to that of the original EX8 with a short minimumphase slowrolloff reconstruction filter between 18 and 19 bits of usable resolution and a large number of aliasing products visible with highlevel highfrequency tones Ayres EX8 20 Integrated Hub does handle low impedances more gracefully than the EX8 and delivers its specified power into 4 ohms Like its predecessor its measured performance is dominated by the decision not to use loop negative feedback in its design I was also puzzled by the somewhat different output impedances and distortion signatures of the two channels  I cant help but wonder if this is due to current supplychain problems which could make it difficult to obtain optimally matched output devices  as nonoptimal matching would be exacerbated by the absence of overall negative feedback Footnote 1 See this YouTube videoFootnote 2 See my measurements hereFootnote 3 Following publication of the review Ayre suspected that a solder joint for one of the output devices in the right channel had failed when the amplifier suffered a shock when it was sent to my place for the measurements I will report on the measured performance of a second sample in the December 2021 issueFootnote 4 This problem was examined in ReTales 11 and this
