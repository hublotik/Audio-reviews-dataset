ATI AT522NC Stereo power amplifier The 522NC costs US 2195 I see Amazon US 1995 The AT522NC part series starts 2 channels class D amplification goes 4 channels enclosureThe industrial design AT522NC unique touches work dontThe part detracts ironically ATI logoThe power button nice feel gives one impression qualityLooking back I surprised choice input power connectionIt 20 amp IEC connection rather common 15 amp variety This partially due use linear power supply massiveheavy toroidal transformer But common reason setup used higher channel count amplificationThe amplifier vertically mounted hypex NC500 class D amplifiers heatsinks The motherboard power supply components Overall seems like neat logical designThe speaker connections course secure high quality expected price range Great see balanced XLR inputs unitIn use barely heat rise enclosure unit never shut complain even face severe clipping The large feet allow better convection cooling appreciatedAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual start dashboard 1 kHz tone 5 watt 4 ohm loadThe use linear power supply price form power supply spurious tones The dominant distortion peak third harmonic bit less 100 dB Add noise SINAD becomes around 98 dB This places ATI522NC well average amplifiers testedIt sits level NC500 Nord Those keep track things I sure compare contrast relative Hypex based implementationsSignal noise ratio good reaching excellence full powerFrequency response orderly class D amplifier needs output filter truncate switching frequency32tone source trying simulate music shows low levels intermodulation distortionBut peak 60 Hz distortionfree range 110 dB 18 bitsCrosstalk also goodMost important data power 4 8 ohm versus distortion noise So lets start 4 ohmSo class leading low distortion providing 300 watts sudden rise distortion Spec higher one data points limit gradually walk curve hence squeeze watts I show laterFor 4 ohm load comparison stateoftheart class D amplification form Purifi reference designPurifi maintains lead distortion produces bit less powerI able run tough test THDN 01 versus frequencies Some amplifiers died trying run test Others poinpoint distortion jumps placeWe see 1 kHz normally measure power almost near max Above reach nearly 360 watts At 20 kHz though distortion shoots way able produce 22 watts THDN 01 hit Fortunately much music energy practical audible concern lowI made survey tracks music library Peak energy seems hover around 40 Hz For reason I started measure amount power 40 Hz 316 watts goodFinishing switching frequency around 400 kHzThe noise doesnt scale power though Plotting max power source frequency 40 Hz gives us thisAnd intermodulation distortion using 1920 kHz 5 watts output 4 ohmConclusionsThe ATI AT522NC seems like solidly built amplifier based Hypex NC500 modules ATI builds amplifiers many companies competence shows review Performance course limited NC500 module Use linear power supply defeats size weight advantages common class D amplifiers It may provide better peak power rating something I wanted test forgot Overall I recommend ATI AT522NC stereo amplifier As always questions comments corrections etc welcomeWatching important news TV I type positive energy think lame joke Please donate using
