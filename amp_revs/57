0, Mark Levinson No53 Reference I used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before testing one of the monoblocks  I ran it at onethird its rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage As the No53 both uses a switching output stage and is very much more efficient at turning power from the wall into voltage and current to drive the loudspeaker this test is not really applicable Still at the end of that period the vertical heatsinks on the amplifiers sides were warm at 901°F  Peculiarly the chassis was warmer than the heatsinks at 97°F  After Id run the amplifier for several hours at lower powers the chassis and heatsinks had stabilized at around 110°F  This is due to the fact that unlike a classD amplifier the switching transistors are continuously passing current The THDnoise percentage at onethird power with the amplifier cold was a very low 00052 this figure dropped to 000495 at the end of one hourThe No53s voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same for balanced and unbalanced operation 268dB as specified Both modes preserved absolute polarity the XLR input jack being wired with pin 2 hot  The balanced input impedance at low and middle frequencies was inconsequentially below the specified 100k ohms at 93k ohms dropping to 64k ohms at 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance was half those figures as expectedThe output impedance at low frequencies was very low at 006 ohm including 6 of speaker cable This rose to 025 ohm at the top of the audioband presumably due to the presence of a passive output filter on the amplifiers output to reduce the level of ultrasonic switching noise Not only did this increase in output impedance give rise to some modification of the amplifiers frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  there was a degree of peaking above the audioband that developed with higher impedances  This peaking resulted in a single cycle of overshoot and welldamped ringing with an 8 ohm load Fig1 Mark Levinson No53 Reference frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Mark Levinson No53 Reference smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms An amplifier with a switching output stage produces ultrasonic noise However with no signal the No53 had 7mV of noise with a center frequency of 197kHz present at its speaker terminals which is significantly lower in level than with a conventional classD amplifier  The No53s unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted was therefore still lower than usual at just 521dB Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 873dB while switching in an Aweighting filter increased it further to 899dB Fig3 shows the spectrum at low frequencies of the Mark Levinsons noise floor while it drove a 1kHz signal at 150W into 8 ohms Note the complete absence of ACsupply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonicsFig3 Mark Levinson No53 Reference spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 150W into 8 ohms Because ultrasonic and radiofrequency noise even at low levels can drive the Audio Precision analyzers input into slewrate limiting which will produce distortion all the following measurements of THD and IMD were taken with Audio Precisions AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which rejects noise above 200kHz and has a maximum input level of ±200V peakFigs 4 5 and 6 show how the THDN percentage in the No53s output varied with power into 8 4 and 2 ohms respectively Below 10W into each load the measurement is dominated by noise indicated by the upward slope of the traces with decreasing power The actual distortion starts to rise above the noise at a few tens of watts but is extremely low in level at or below 0005 into the higher impedances Defining clipping as the power at which the amplifier was producing 1 of THDN the No53 readily exceeds its specified output power clipping at 686W into 8 ohms  1080W into 4 ohms  and 1500W into 2 ohms  Fig4 Mark Levinson No53 Reference distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms Fig5 Mark Levinson No53 Reference distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms Fig6 Mark Levinson No53 Reference distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms This amplifier is a powerhouse However plotting the THDN percentage against frequency at a voltage where I could be sure that the measurement was showing actual distortion rather than noise—1415V equivalent to 25W into 8 ohms 50W into 4 ohms and 100W into 2 ohms—revealed that the THD rose considerably above 500Hz particularly into lower impedances  I wasnt expecting this as one supposed benefit of Mark Levinsons proprietary classI outputstage topology is improved highfrequency linearity compared with conventional classD designs I also wasnt expecting what I found when waveform of the No53s residual distortion a burst of highfrequency noise at every zerocrossing point  Into lower impedances these bursts of noise were accompanied by voltage spikes alternately positive and negativegoing at the exact zerovoltage points  Note that while the actual THDN percentage was very low at 0005 this kind of behavior might be more audible than the low percentage would suggestFig7 Mark Levinson No53 Reference THDN  vs frequency  at 1415V into 16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8 Mark Levinson No53 Reference 1kHz waveform at 173W into 8 ohms  0005 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Mark Levinson No53 Reference 1kHz waveform at 340W into 4 ohms  0005 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out At low frequencies the No53s distortion spectrum was dominated by the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  though dominated is not really the appropriate word to use for something lying at –106dB  This graph was taken into 8 ohms reducing the load increased the level of the third harmonic by 10dB with the second harmonic making an appearance just above –120dB  but no higherorder harmonics present However with a 1kHz tone at the same level a picket fence of harmonics appeared both even and oddorder  which correlates with the bursts and spikes at the waveforms zerocrossing points Again while the levels of these harmonics are sufficiently low that it is unlikely they will be audible with music this is still something I dont like to seeFig10 Mark Levinson No53 Reference spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 150W into 8 ohms Fig11 Mark Levinson No53 Reference spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 300W into 4 ohms Fig12 Mark Levinson No53 Reference spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 150W into 8 ohms Surprisingly despite the amplifiers reduced linearity at the top of the audioband it performed well on the punishing highfrequency intermodulation test  The difference product resulting from the equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lay at –114dB  and the higherorder intermodulation products all lay at or below –83dB Fig13 Mark Levinson No53 Reference HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 300W peak into 4 ohms In almost all ways the Mark Levinson Reference No53 measures superbly well especially for an amplifier with a switching output stage But I keep returning to those bursts of noise and distortion at the signals zerocrossing points As I said the absolute level of this behavior was very low But it is a very unnatural thing to happen and I cant help wondering if this behavior lay at the root of Michael Fremers dissatisfaction with the No53s sound I took a listen to the Mark Levinsons driving Wilson Alexandria XLF speakers in his listening room  The sound was initially very impressive It had tremendous dynamic sweep with superb control of the Wilsons woofers tremendous clarity and nothing identifiably wrong However the more I listened the more the overall sonic picture seemed flat and uninvolving An enigma
