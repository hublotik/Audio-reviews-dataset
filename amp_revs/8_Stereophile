As I usually power amplifiers Marantz SM11S1 Reference running channels onethird maximum measured power 8 ohms one hour Thermally maximally stresses amplifier classB AB output stage At end period wire grilles set top panel hot chassis barely warm The Marantz adequate heatsinking amplifier rated power In addition measured THDnoise percentage didnt change preconditioning indicating stable design topology The LCD power meter front panel quite accurate indicating 488W amplifier driving measured 485Wpc 8 ohms The meter also takes impedance account halving impedance 8 4 ohms almost doubled indicated powerThough bridged mono operation Marantz stereo mode Michael Fremer listened The SM11S1s gain adjusted range ±6dB The amplifier set factory default review indicated meter Gain 0 condition voltage gain 8 ohms significantly lower norm 2235dB balanced inputs 227dB unbalanced inputs figures slightly lower specified 230dB The unbalanced input preserved absolute polarity balanced input inverted polarity however confirming XLR jacks wired pin 3 rather pin 2 hot The unbalanced input impedance little lower specified around 18k ohms across audioband dropping slightly inconsequentially 172k ohms 20kHz The balanced input offered twice values expectedThe SM11S1s output impedance low 008 ohm low middle frequencies rising slightly 011 ohm 20kHz As result modification amplifiers frequency response interaction impedance loudspeaker ±01dB The amplifiers output 8 ohms less 2dB 200kHz smallsignal bandwidth decrease slightly lower impedances Even worst case 2 ohms output 20kHz 02dB That indeed wide bandwidth design confirmed SM11S1s excellent reproduction 1kHz 10kHz squarewaves Fig1 Marantz SM11S1 frequency response 283V simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig2 Marantz SM11S1 smallsignal 1kHz squarewave 8 ohmsFig3 Marantz SM11S1 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave 8 ohmsChannel separation excellent better 90dB directions 2kHz though decreased 70dB 20kHz The Aweighted signalnoise ratio ref 1W 8 ohms measured input shorted specification 1016dB It worsened 638dB wideband unweighted measurement due presence lowlevel HF noiseSpecified delivering 110Wpc 8 ohms 220Wpc 4 ohms SM11S1 easily exceeded figures test bench clipping 140Wpc 8 ohms 230Wpc 4 ohms The manner THDN percentage changed output power two loads shown fig4 distortion extremely low levels clipping actually lies beneath noise floor 10W The amplifier went protection sustained delivery 230Wpc 4 ohms I didnt repeat test 2 ohms Plotting THDN figure changes frequency revealed large increase measured THD 2 ohms suggesting amplifier indeed uncomfortable driving loads less 4 ohmsFig4 Marantz SM11S1 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 4 8 ohmsFig5 Marantz SM11S1 THDN vs frequency 1315V 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms To certain I looking distortion rather noise I performed test relatively high voltage 1315V equivalent 215W 8 ohms however Marantz offers low levels distortion 0002 midrange bass 8 ohms 4 ohms The distortion plots show usual rise treble due amplifiers finite openloop bandwidth reducing amount corrective negative feedback higher frequencies level remains 001 The left channel slightly worse respectInto higher impedances content distortion predominantly benign second harmonic though third harmonic make stronger appearance output current increases Even second third harmonics lie –100dB though higherorder harmonics seen 10–20dB lower still Despite decrease linearity seen 5kHz fig5 levels intermodulation products produced amplifier driving demanding 11 mix 19 20kHz tones level visible waveform clipping oscilloscope low As expected fig5 however level 1kHz difference tone left channel little higher right Fig6 Marantz SM11S1 1kHz waveform 485W 8 ohms 00103 THDN distortion noise waveform fundamental notched Fig7 Marantz SM11S1 spectrum 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz 63W 8 ohms Fig8 Marantz SM11S1 spectrum 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz 123W 4 ohms Fig9 Marantz SM11S1 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz 60W peak 8 ohms Overall Marantz SM11S1 Reference offered clean bill health test bench It pleasure measure amplifier competently designed
