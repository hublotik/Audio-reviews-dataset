0, Earthquake XJ300ST stereo amplifier It was kindly donated by a member for testing It costs US 46283 from the company websiteI like the compact packaging and old school but solid feeling switchgear Likewise having a lowpass filter  filter corner frequency and phase come in handy And of course the integrated volume control Back panel is typical with the exception of crossing terminals 12 volt trigger is icing on the cakeUnit runs is a class J amplifier and was cool and comfortable during testing Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboardWe have massive mains spike which I could hardly reduce no matter what I did I am assuming it is internal leakage Cant figure out why one channel is so much more distorted than the other Averaging the two the amp falls in poor category of all tested with a SINAD of 59Frequency response showed strong roll off at both ends of the spectrumThere is a note about a 15 Hz high pass but nothing about the top end  programmable lowpass by more or less setting it to 80 Hz and got thisCrosstalk is very poorSNR was poor likely due to high levels of power supplymains noisePower is modestI have no idea how they have arrived at their power specFinally here is the 8 ohm performanceConclusionsNot much to hang your head on here other than the compact size and functionality Not sure how it is suitable for subwoofer duty when it has so little power Cant recommend it
