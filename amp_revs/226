0, of a refurbished and upgraded NAD 2200 stereo amplifier It was bought by a member sent to QuirkAudio to be fully updated and then loaned to me The work that Peter has done is exemplary The inside looks brand new I have repaired hundreds of amplifiers but never seen one this clean So not only have the inside components been updatedreplaced but a lot of care has gone to cosmetically clean the unit Peter sent me a long list of parts he has upgraded including reservoir capacitors and such As a result I dont know how representative of measurements are of stock units although probably not too far off Used 2200 go for about US 530 on ebayThe front panel is nice with an informative clipping indicatorAs you see you can put the amp in bridge mode  and select whether you want soft clipping on I left it off as you see in the pictureDuring use the protection circuit came on when appropriate and nicely reset as if nothing had happenedThe NAD 2200 uses a dual voltage rail to keep power consumption and heat dissipation low when producing lower power and then upping the voltage for peak power This is a common technique but usually applied to low baseline power level Here 100 watts of power is provided using the low voltage power supply rail and it is only for power above that where the higher voltage is used Technique worked quite well as you see later and kept the amplifier cool and happy during my testingAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 wattsNot bad Distortion is at or below 100 dB With noise SINAD degrades to about 93 dB putting the 2200 well above average of nearly 100 amplifiers tested to dateNotice that the gain is quite high at 32 dB Common range is 25 to 29 dB with the latter being a THX standard The higher gain increases noise so despite that performance is as good as seen High gain makes it a good fit for AVRs for example that produce distorted output well below nominal 2 voltsFrequency response has a sharp roll off which seems to indicate the output is not direct coupled  as is common todayOr maybe it is on purpose I dont knowCrosstalk is very goodAs is dynamic rangeIt is power measurements where the magic of this amplifier comes to life so lets look at that with 4 ohm load firstWe can see a kink in distortion when we hit 200 watts as the unit sails past that to produce whopping 337 watts per channel both driven Per design characteristics you can have much more during momentary peaksWow we have one kilowatt of power coming out of this amp in short durationSwitching to 8 ohm we see similar results as 4 ohmSweeping the power test at 4 ohm with different frequencies shows a wellbehaved amplifierYou do loose power in higher frequencies but that is fine since music spectrum has lower energy there anywayDue to the long duration of this test the protection circuit likely backed off the high voltage rail producing lower output levelsEDIT adding Lab Input MeasurementsLab Input MeasurementsI was surprised that the frequency response was not flat but was relieved to see later in the thread that this is due to insertion of low and high pass filters So here is the frequency response with Lab input that doesnt have such a filterResponse now  as it should be ruler flat to below 10 Hz and well extending past the 40 kHz limit of this measurementI figured the filters may be adding some noisedistortion so reran the dashboard againDistortion doesnt change but if you look at the noise floor at 20 Hz it is down by some 10 dB That improves SINAD a couple of dBs making the amplifier stand out even moreZoomedAnd signal to noise ratioConclusionsNice to see innovation like this from equipment that is over 30 years old Shame on manufacturers that produce amplifiers for much less power more distortion and higher prices these days No you dont get a fancy case here and sheet metal is strictly budget category But you are not going to sit on the amp The guts are where it matters and NAD 2200 deliversNOTE the output relay on stock 2200 gets corroded and fails over time There are videos and DIY threads on how to upgrade the relay there to fix the problem The unit tested here has that fix Other than that there are not reports of many other reliability issues even though NAD products are often said to be less reliable than other brandsOverall I am happy to recommend the NAD 2200 I almost gave it the highest honors but given the upgraded nature of the test unit and the fact that used amps may have issues I avoided that But you could have easily pushed me to give it the golfing panther
