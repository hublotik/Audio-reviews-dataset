AIYIMA A07 Pro stereo amplifier costs 90As see distinguishing factor Aiyima amplifiers inclusion tone controls Alas also problem unit detent way setting response flat Worse yet small changes dials make large differences tonality So I like toner controls I definitely like see tone defeat feature Otherwise unit feels nice use operate As typical power supply much larger amplifier itselfAIYIMA A07 Pro MeasurementsAs usual start dashboard 1 kHz tone pure 4 ohm load driven stereo 5 wattsWe expect good performance AIYIMA get itSwitching PowerCube Loadbox simulate complex loads As see performance essentially sameNoise performance good enough class budget amplifiersMultitone shows good performanceFrequency response unfortunately load dependentSo may forced use treble control adjust high frequency response speakerCrosstalk goodLets get important power measurements starting 4 ohmThis plenty desktop use Switching 8 ohm naturally robs us fair amount powerFortunately vast majority speakers market 4 ohm nominalTo see stability amplifier lets subject suite loads reactive componentsAn ideal amplifier would follow red line We essentially 8 4 ohm Surprisingly little amp managed also keep running 2 ohm albeit without capacitive component power drop Many amps simply shut wont even work 2 ohmEdit response vs frequency I forgot post originallyFinally warm profileIn use amplifier ran pretty coolConclusionsThe AIYIMA A07 Pro continues tradition company providing competent levels noise distortion good bit power reasonable price While tone controls nice added feature lack defeat switch And usual load dependencyPersonally I much dislike lack tone control defeat wont buy But doesnt bother AIYIMA A07 Pro another good bargain stereo amplification
