0, JL Electronics  SylphD200 stereo amplifier module built on top of TIs TPA3255 amplifier IC Depending on the configuration you pick the module costs US 130 to 170 You can read more about it here  Or ask questions from the company representative jlesterpTesting bare modules is difficult for me so I asked for a finished system and that is what I receivedNot much to see here so lets look at the module insideI must say that row of inductors looks pretty lined up that way  I should note that the company is an ODM  for other companies and is located in Philippines They provided their own measurements that correlate well with mineThere are two power supply configurations The version I have is the lower voltage one  that produces lower power than than if you choose to power it with 45 volt railsJLE SylphD200 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboardThe gain is rather low compared to 29 dB that I usually see in amplifiers Then again this allows full power at the levels that our desktop DACs produce so it is fine I understand the base gain in the TI chip is lower still A buffer opamp is used to get up to 14 dB The lower gain gives an advantage to this board when it comes to other amplifiers which have more noise due to higher gain Still lets do our usual SINAD comparisonThe board is just 01 dB short of falling in our superb category in blue I am told that there is a bit of SINAD loss at the speaker terminals as opposed to the board itself If so this is a remarkable achievementNoise performance is excellent but again keep in mind the lower gainAt 5 watts it easily clears my 16bit96 dB hurdle This shows that we can build more optimized systems if we take full advantage of the output of our DACs with amplifiers that have lower gain The board can be configured with the feedback including the output filter or not The configuration I have has it including the filter which reduces load dependency but does not eliminate itMultitone test shows the classic rise of distortion with frequencyCrosstalk performance was very goodPower sweep into 4 ohm load shows very low and interestingly constant distortion ratio until hard clippingCompany thinks the input buffer is overloading As noted to get more power you need to step up to higher voltage power supplyThe hard clipping made it hard for AP software to properly determine the 1THD point but did show the burst powerSwitching to 8 ohm we getTesting for frequency sensitivity we see that behavior is decentConclusionsIt is amazing to see the progress these chip amps are making in the hands of capable designers They are inching their way to the top of the class in our distortion and noise rankings while keeping costs very low In the case of JLE it is nice to see a design from another part of the world making it easier to access DIY oriented hobbyists to access them who are locally situated Interacting with member jlesterp has been a delight as wellI am happy to recommend the JLE SylphD200 amplifier module As always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
