0, XTZ A2300 class D amplifier   costs US 500 from the company direct  It is based on BO ICE 300ASC or its newer name 300A1While you wont mistake the enclosure for A2300 as a highend custom design it has enough extra touches to set it above typical DIY type casesThere are some nice looking vents on the side  Note however that all the heat is centralized in the center bottom panel as is typical of class D amp modules In use though the bottom barely got warm although I could smell heat generation through side ventsI was disappointed to not see balanced inputsThe gain potentiometer will make the unit flexible but they are typically not good for reliability Since these controls dont get used often then tend to go bad If you buy this unit be sure to turn the control left and right once a few monthsBinding posts are substantial which I likedXTZ A2300 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohmAs noted I adjusted the gain control to give me roughly 29 dB which is the standard value I use for my testing  Distortion is fairly low at 98 dB or so but there is enough noise to cost you 10 dB and a bit more in the other channel This makes SINAD still above averageAs noted noise is somewhat an issue and we can see that in signal to noise ratioNotice how one channel is 35 dB worse than the otherI was a bit disappointed to see frequency response being impacted by my simple resistive load showing peaking around 20 kHzMore complex speaker loads may make this worse  Crosstalk is OKHere is our power level versus distortionnoise at 4 ohmWe see the same noise differential here and some distortion differential as well  Power is way short of 300 watts Letting distortion rise to 1 which is what the spec calls for we are still shy of thatSo definitely not conservatively rated8 ohm load naturally produces a lot less powerTypical of ICE modules they dont behave evenly across the frequency rangeThat is quite a variation in distortion and noise relative to power In some sense then our previous tests using 1 kHz are not as representative of the total performanceConclusionsI started the review liking the enclosure But then got a bit more jaded with unbalanced only inputs and higher than expected noise level high frequency dependency on both frequency response and distortionnoise Then again performance is still above average compared to many amplifiers I have tested This produced a quandary for me I could recommend it and justify it  At the end I decided to not recommend it but without strong feelings one way or the other You have the data to decide for yourself
