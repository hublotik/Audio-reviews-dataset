0, of Living Sound Audio Electronics Voyager GAN 350 stereo amplifier   costs US 3000 from the companyI really like the highend look of this amplifier caseStrange though as there is no power indicator nor switch The latter is in the back onlyI really dislike the hard to read type on the back Other than that the connectors seem to be of good qualityAs the name indicates this amplifier uses GaN transistors to ostensibly lower distortion and increase efficiency of the amplification In use the bottom where all the modules are mounted barely god warm so efficiency is goodLSA Voyager GAN350 MeasurementsI started my testing with XLR inputs which showed really odd resultsAs you see the gain is nearly 10 dB different between the channels I looked for configuration switches but couldnt find anything After wasting half hour I switched to RCA input and problem vanishedIf I were to guess I would say the XLR input is miswired on one channel Bad execution if so in such an expensive amplifier For the rest of the test I stuck with RCA inputSignal to noise ratio while OK is not state of the artI like to see full 16 bit96 dB dynamic range at 5 watts We fall short hereFrequency response was sad to seeClass D amplifiers have a low pass filter that can interact with the load if not designed well and that is what we have here The impact falls clearly in audible band This would be OK for a budget amplifier in 100 range but not in this class Depending on what speaker you hook up to this amplifier the highs may be exaggerated or filteredCrosstalk on the other hand was exceptional due to dual mono design and no crosstalk through the power supplyMultitone performance was also very good indicating low intermodulation distortionPower was healthy into 4 ohm albeit with unexceptional distortion and noise levelsThere is still plenty of power available even into 8 ohmInteresting how distortion keeps rising and clipping is rather soft As they state this indicates low amount of negative feedbackTransfer function is frequency dependent with distortion rising quite a bit at higher frequencies Spectrum of switching frequency shows good attenuation but not that high of a frequencyIf they had opted for higher speed which GaN transistors allow the impact of the output filter would have been lower The amplifier doesnt need any warm up as it is stable on power onConclusionsOther than having a lot of power and good efficiency there is not much else to be happy here Clearly companies are using GaN as a buzzword without fully taking advantage of what it can provide Lots of money is left on the table here in many areas from frequency response load dependency to high amount of distortion At the end of the day you have an expensive high power amplifier here with average performanceI cant recommend the LSA Voyager GAN 350 Performance is not there nor is quality controlEdit teardown just posted always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
