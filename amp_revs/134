0,As can be seen from fig1 the Rowland exhibits a virtually rulerflat frequencyresponse curve The 10kHz squarewave  indicates a fast risetime with no significant rounding of the leading edges Polarity of the Rowland was noninverting and input impedance at 1kHz was 208k ohms 95k ohms and 750 ohms at the 20k ohm 100k ohm and 600 ohm input settings respectively It required 1424mV to give an output of 1W into 8 ohms a gain of 26dB Unweighted noise was 753dB below 1W into 8 ohms Channel separation was better than 105dB below 15kHz  decreasing linearly to 92dB at 20kHzFig1 Rowland Model 1 frequency response at 1W into 8 ohms Fig2 Rowland Model 1 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe output impedance of the Model 1 was uniformly low ranging from 0056 to 0065 ohms across the audible range Distortion at low power is shown in fig3 which plots THDnoise against frequency at 283V into 8 4 and 2 ohms  The consistently low distortion increases as the impedance drops—not unexpectedly What is interesting is the slight reduction in distortion into both 4 and 2 ohms at higher frequencies which is unusual suggesting perhaps that the amplifiers VHF bandwidth narrows a little with increasing output current The waveform of the distortion in fig4  indicates a predominantly thirdharmonic characteristic overlaid with noise The equivalent waveform for a 1kHz 1W output into 8 ohms  was dominated by noiseFig3 Rowland Model 1 THDnoise vs frequency at  4W into 2 ohms 2W into 4 ohms 1W into 8 ohmsFig4 Rowland Model 1 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig5 shows the spectrum from a 50Hz sinewave driven at 80W into 4 ohms The second harmonic is negligible the third harmonic is stronger  but still down 758dB Fig6 shows the highfrequency IM spectrum with 19 and 20kHz tones driven at 80W into 4 ohms The 1kHz product is down 835dB well under 0001 A similar measurement for 40W into 8 ohms is not shown since it was if anything slightly better at –853dB Fig5 Rowland Model 1 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz at 67W into 4 ohms Fig6 Rowland Model 1 HF intermodulation spectrum DC22kHz 1920kHz at 48V peak into 8 ohms Fig7 indicates the THD vs power for 8 4 and 2 ohms at 1kHz one channel driven  The maximum output power at 1 THD was 84W  into 8 ohms 140W  into 4 ohms and 220W  into 2 ohms These figures all lie well above the knee of the distortion curve I consider the knee of this curve when well defined and followed by a rapidly increasing distortion above it to indicate the highest practical useful power output of an amplifier In the case of the Model 1 the knee falls at 67W  130W  and 215W  In the latter two cases I choose as the knee the breakpoint before the steepest slope of the distortion curveFig7 Rowland Model 1 distortion  vs output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms and 2 ohmsWith both channels driven the Model 1s output power was 76W  into 8 ohms and 1268  into 4 ohms  The powersupply fuses blew  at 190W into 2 ohms before clipping could be reachedDC offset in the Rowland was 2mV in the left channel 3mV in the right It operated quite warm to the touch following its 1hour 13power preconditioning but not hotFinally I measured both the frequency response and the lowpower THDnoise vs frequency for the Rowland set for a 600 ohm load Except for the input impedance measurements where all three settings were checked the above measurements were made into the amplifiers 20k ohm setting The curves have not been shown because they did not differ at all from the equivalent curves for the 20k ohm settingAttempting to relate the outstanding labtest results of the Rowland Model 1 to its equally rewarding sound was a hopeless task However the measurements in this case merely indicated that this is from any objective measure a solidly designed amplifier—Thomas J Norton
