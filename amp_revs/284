0, of BasX A100 Class AB amplifier It was kindly purchased by  drop shipped to me for testing The A100 costs US 229 from the company directI must stay this is one gorgeous looking and nicely feeling amplifierThis is a deep cabinet ending in the terminals in the backAs you see it has trigger capability Not a fan of the figure 8 AC mains cable as I have very few of them Best to not lose itThere is a fan on top but I did not hear it come on The unit does get quite warm though so allow ample coolingspace above itEmotiva BasX A100 MeasurementsAnother member had contacted me asking me if I could test if the unit was distorted while cold I had stopped testing for this since the warm up effect has been so minimal Not so hereYou see what I am seeing 12 dB improvement in distortion after 5 minutes I am assuming bias is not optimal while cold but why Temperature compensation is quite cheap and has been part of design of amplifiers foreverAnyway here is our usual dashboardNot happy about the channel gain difference As it is performance is a bit below averageI like to see a dynamic range at 5 watt approaching 96 dB and we are fair bit short of thatFrequency response is flat enoughCrosstalk is pretty good for a budget ampHere is the multitonePower versus distortionnoise is goodIf we allow 1 THD we get the power spec from the companyDistortion characteristic has a simple relationship with frequency and that is itConclusionI really like the packaging and price of this amplifier While overall performance is good having to wait 6 minutes before it stabilizes is just not acceptable I would be tempted to buy this and mod it to make it temperature stableAs is I cant recommend the Emotiva BasX A100 amplifier
