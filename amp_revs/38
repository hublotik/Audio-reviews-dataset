0, CH Precision I1 Universal amplifier   ing I connected the amplifiers Ethernet port to my network then ran it at onethird power into 8 ohms At the end of that period its top panel was warm at 1078°F  and the frontpanel display indicated that the internal temperature was 63°C  I wasnt able to test the CH I1s phono stage because its currentmode input didnt appear to be compatible with the Audio Precisions voltagemode output Looking first at the linelevel analog inputs With the volume control at its maximum setting—the default setting is 0dB though additional gain up to 24dB can be selected for each input via the menu—the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms from the speaker terminals measured a low 2253dB for the balanced input but 29dB for the unbalanced inputs  The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  from all outputs The unbalanced input impedance was 44k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to 23k ohms at 20kHz As expected the balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced value The preamplifier output offered an insertion loss of 07dB with an appropriately low output impedance of 72 ohms across the audiobandThe output impedance at the speaker terminals  varied according to the amount of global negative feedback selected with the menu With global negative feedback set to 100 the output impedance was 011 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 015 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modulation of the I1s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±01dB  Reducing the feedback level to 60 increased the impedance to 023 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz 027 ohm at 20kHz With 40 feedback the respective impedances were 03 and 032 ohm With no global feedback the impedance was 040 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz 044 ohm at 20kHz and the modulation of the frequency response was now ±02dB Fig1 CH Precision I1 analog input 100 feedback volume control at max digitized frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Bypass frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms  Fig2 CH Precision I1 analog input 0 feedback volume control at max digitized frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  An unusual aspect of these two response graphs is that the amplifiers output drops sharply above 35kHz I had understood that in Normal mode the I1 digitizes its analog line inputs at 384kHz—but figs 1 and 2 suggest that the sample rate is actually 882 or 96kHz There is nothing in the manual about changing the sample rate for the analog inputs nor do the frontpanel or Androidtablet setup menus offer options for this I did wonder if the sample rate was somehow affected by that of the data present at the digital inputs however even with for example the AESEBU input receiving 192kHz data the analog digitizing sampling remained at the lower rate When I set the balanced input to Bypass which eliminates the digitizing  I got the frequency response shown as the blue and yellow traces in fig1 It extends significantly higher in frequency not reaching –3dB until 100kHz  In Normal mode the digitization affects the shapes of 1kHz  and 10kHz  squarewavesFig3 CH Precision I1 analog input smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig4 CH Precision I1 analog input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 110dB in both directions below 2kHz decreasing to 80dB at 20kHz With the analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured 626dB in both channels Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 833dB and an Aweighting filter increased it further to 860dB Levels of residual spuriae at the AC powerline frequency and its oddorder harmonics presumably due to magnetic coupling from the massive power transformer were very low Fig5 CH Precision I1 analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms CH Precision specifies the I1 as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive in both channels the CH exceeded that spec delivering 120Wpc into 8 ohms  With both channels driven into 4 ohms  the I1 clipped at 210W  compared with the specified power into this load of 175Wpc  Fig6 was taken with 100 global feedback the actual distortion is below the noise floor until the power reaches 50W or so Repeating the 8 and 4 ohm tests with 0 feedback gave the same clipping power but with about 20 times higher distortion below clipping Fig6 CH Precision I1 analog input 100 feedback distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms both channels drivenFig7 CH Precision I1 analog input 100 feedback distortion  vs 1kHz

analog input 0 feedback distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms both channels drivenWith the amplifier set to 100 feedback I measured its THDN percentage against frequency at a level of 1265V which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms 40W into 4 ohms and 80W into 2 ohms The distortion levels were low even into 2 ohms  and perhaps more important didnt rise by much at higher frequencies This was also true when the I1 was set to 0 feedback though the distortion levels were again around 20 times higher Fig10 CH Precision I1 analog input 100 feedback distortion  vs frequency at 1265V

third harmonic was the highest in level but with higherorder harmonics present with zero feedback Spectral analysis indicated that with 100 feedback the second and third harmonics were equal in level though at –104dB  both are negligible  With 0 feedback the higherorder harmonics are present at much higher levels  Both secondorder and higherorder intermodulation products at 20Wpc into 8 ohms with 100 feedback were negligible  All the IM products increased as I reduced the feedback level and with 0 feedback the secondorder product reached a stilllow –80dB  Fig12 CH Precision I1 analog input 100

Precision I1 analog input 0 feedback HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 20Wpc peak into 8 ohms Turning to the digital inputs the I1ss AESEBU and coaxial SPDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz The optical input topped out at 96kHz All digital inputs preserved absolute polarity Apples USB Prober utility identified the I1 as CH Precision USB Audio 20 from CH Precision and confirmed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the I1s USB port could handle 16 and 24bit integer data at all sample rates up to 384kHz With the volume control set to its normal maximum of 0dB a 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in output levels of 136V at the balanced preamp outputs and 2055V into 8 ohms at the speaker outputs The frontpanel display indicated that the amplifier was clipping with digital data higher in level than –11dBFS Therefore I continued testing the digital inputs from the balanced preamplifier outputs with the volume control set to –12dBThe CHs impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that its reconstruction filter is a very short linearphase type with just a couple of cycles of ringing to either side of the single sample at 0dBFS The manual says that the I1s reconstruction filter can be set to linear phase or minimum phase However neither the frontpanel display nor the Android app offered a menu item for switching between the two reconstruction filters Perhaps this choice will be the subject of a firmware updateFig18 CH Precision I1 digital input impulse response With 441kHzsampled white noise upsampled to 3528kHz  the I1s response rolled off slowly above the audioband not reaching full stopband suppression until an octave above the Nyquist frequency of 2205kHz  The aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  is suppressed by only 10dB though almost no other aliasing products are present The CH Precisions digital frequency response with AESEBU data at 441 96 and 192kHz followed the same basic shape at each sample rate with a slow rolloff that reached –3dB at 20kHz with 441kHz data  Some passband ripples present in the top audio octave with 441kHz data are absent at the higher sample ratesFig19 CH Precision I1 digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at

tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor dropped by about 15dB meaning that the I1 offers between 17 and 18 bits worth of resolution With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical though some HF noise was present With undithered 24bit data the result was a slightly noisy sinewave

low  When  digital inputs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit JTest data the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were all at the correct levels  with no other sidebands visible There were no sidebands visible with 24bit JTest data Fig24 CH Precision I1 digital input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 0dBFS 441kHz data Fig25 CH Precision I1 digital input
