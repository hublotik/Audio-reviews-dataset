0, Octave Audio V 80 SE using my topoftheline  system  Measurements were taken with the Octaves rearpanel switch set to High Power as recommended for the KT150 outputstage tubes  After warming up the amplifier for an hour I checked the bias for each of the four output tubes using the central LED array and the righthand rotary switch on the front panel All tubes were correctly biased for KT150s with the red and green LEDs illuminated for each tubeThe maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 3875dB for both the unbalanced and balanced inputs Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  the XLRs being wired with pin 2 hot When I switched the amplifier to Extern mode which separates the V 80 SEs preamplifier and poweramplifier sections the gain at the preamplifier output jacks was 0dB rather than the specified 12dB ie all the voltage gain was being supplied by the poweramplifier stage which also includes the volume control At the rearpanel headphone jack the maximum gain was 246dB The balanced input impedance was a high 26k ohms across the audioband the unbalanced input impedance was 39k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping inconsequentially to 33k ohms at 20kHzThe preamplifier sections output impedance was a low 5 ohms across the audioband that from the headphone jack was 19 ohms which will be too high for lowimpedance phones Measured at the speaker terminals the output impedance was fairly high measuring 184 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 31 ohms at 20kHz As a result the variation in the V 80 SEs frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was ±11dB  The other traces in this graph show the response into 8 4 and 2 ohms Note the excellent matching between channels but also the slight peak just above 40kHz With a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  this peak correlates with a small degree of overshoot on the waveforms leading edges followed by a single cycle of damped ringing This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum there was no difference in response at lower settings and the excellent channel balance was preserved From the headphone output the frequency response was flat to 30kHz and down by 3dB at 140kHz Fig1 Octave Audio V 80 SE frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Octave Audio V 80 SE smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was good rather than great at 69dB R–L and 74dB L–R at 2kHz decreasing to 48 and 57dB respectively at 20kHz The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum—the worstcase situation—was very good at 791dB left and 7825dB right Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these ratios to 826 and 817dB respectively while switching in an Aweighting filter gave respective ratios of 873 and 879dB Fig3 shows the lowfrequency spectrum of the V 80 SEs output as it drove a 1kHz sinewave at 1W into 8 ohms ACsupply–related components can be seen in both channels though all the spuriae lie at a low level in absolute terms and the 120Hzrelated components are lower in the left channel than in the rightFig3 Octave Audio V 80 SE spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Figs 4 and 5 show how the THDnoise percentage in the V 80 SEs output varied with power into 8 and 4 ohms respectively Octave specifies the maximum power into 4 ohms with KT150 tubes as 120Wpc  and fig5 reveals that with both channels operating the amplifier just reached this power at 3 distortion At our usual definition of clipping  the amplifier gave 433Wpc into 4 ohms  and 79Wpc into 8 ohms  Though the THDN is very low below 1W into either load the steady rise in THD with power in both graphs suggests that only a modest degree of loop negative feedback is used The headphone output clipped at 9V into 300 ohms which will be more than sufficient drive capability with typical highimpedance cansFig4 Octave Audio V 80 SE distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms Fig5 Octave Audio V 80 SE distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms I didnt test the Octave amplifiers clipping power into 2 ohms as the V 80 SE was not comfortable driving a load that low This can be seen in fig6 which shows how the THDN percentage varies with frequency at 633V which is equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms  10W into 4 ohms  and 20W into 2 ohms  However into higher impedances the rise in THD at low frequencies is modest implying that the V 80 SEs output transformer has a hefty core The rise in THD at the other end of the audioband is also relatively modest for a pushpull amplifier with a single pair of output tubes and limited loop negative feedbackFig6 Octave Audio V 80 SE THDN  vs frequency at 633V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fortunately the nature of the distortion is heavily thirdharmonic  which will be relatively innocuous At low frequencies at moderate powers the second harmonic is almost as high as the third  the second lies at –60dB  the third at –54dB  At moderate powers the V 80 SE produced a low level of intermodulation products when driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones  the 1kHz difference product lying at –69dB  still the higherorder products are higher in level particularly in the left channel Fig7 Octave

Octave Audio V 80 SE HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 8W peak into 8 ohms Although the rearpanel phono input jacks were marked MC Phono our review sample of the V 80 SE was fitted with a movingmagnet stage The gain at 1kHz measured at the preamplifier output jacks  was appropriate for MM cartridges at 404dB as was the input impedance which ranged from 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz to 215k ohms at 20kHz The phono stage preserved absolute polarity The RIAA error is shown in fig10 the two channels match closely but there is a small peak 075dB high between 30 and 40Hz before the output rapidly rolls off reaching –3dB at 18Hz At the other end of the spectrum the response is down by 3dB at 63kHzFig10 Octave Audio V 80 SE phonostage response with RIAA correction  Channel separation via the phono input  was very good at 80dB R–L and 90dB L–R at 2kHz decreasing to 65 and 60dB respectively at 20kHz The phono signalnoise ratios were also very good at 70dB  75dB  and 824dB  all ref1kHz at 5mV and taken with the inputs shorted to groundThe Octaves phono stage also featured very low distortion spectrum with a 1kHz tone at 20mV input 12dB higher than the standard MM level of 5mV and equivalent to an output at the preamplifier jacks of 2V Even so as can be seen in fig11 the only distortion harmonic that can be seen above the low noise floor is the second at –110dB  Intermodulation distortion  was higher in level nevertheless the difference product at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lay at –66dB  The phono overload margins ref 1kHz at 5mV were superb at 28dB at 20Hz 26dB at 1kHz and still 14dB at 20kHzFig11 Octave Audio V 80 SE spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 2V into 100k ohms As I was with the other Octave Audio amplifiers we have reviewed  I was impressed by the V 80 SEs measured performance Footnote 1 The RE 290 in January 2013 and the V40 SE in August 2014
