0, Monoprice 150 watt 605030 rack mountable pro stereo amplifier It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing The 605030 costs just US 119 from Amazon including Prime shipping which is remarkably lowFrom a distance the unit looks like any other pro R1U amplifierIt looks rather cheap an unattractive to me but hard to imagine any pro amp getting some kind of design award for their looksTwo gain controls are provided in the front which I appreciated For testing I aspire for gain of 29 dB and I almost got there at max level as shown That is how  unit There overload indicators which was niceWhat I did not like one bit was the rather loud fan which runs continuously Monoprice please take another 5 from me and make the fan temperature dependent pleaseSeeing balanced input in any amplifier at 115 price range is incredible but that is what we have hereOutput is provided in the form of SpeakOn and mono 14 inch sockets Neither is convenient for inhome use but you can deal with it as I didThe loud fan did have one benefit the amp never changed temps above the room after all my testsAmplifier Audio MeasurementsI powered on the unit and ran the dashboard and was immediately disappointed with the very high distortionI checked all of my connections and distortion persisted I almost didnt run the rest of my tests but decided to do anyway As another 5 to 10 minutes passed I noticed the performance had improved so I went back and remeasured the dashboard againI have never seen an amplifier improve by 11 dB after brief warm up Some kind of thermal compensation is left out to save money I guess If the fan was not running you could leave it running all the time but with the fan I certainly would not Anyway the ranking is still below average but at least not in the broken categoryFrequency response shows anomalies in the filtering of the switching designDepending on your speaker and its impedance you may get accentuated highs There is also low frequency roll off which indicates likely capacitor couplingSignal to noise ratio is nothing to write home aboutCrosstalk is kind of averagePower versus distortion and noise into 4 ohm load shows unacceptable rise at higher power levelsWe get the rated power and no moreInto 8 ohm performance is rather strangeWeird to see that smooth and gradual rise in distortion as if not much feedback is usedSweeps versus different frequencies indicates the same issue as distortion rises with frequencyFinally without my AES filter here is the ultrasonic spectrumPretty ugly but levels are low and of course well above our hearingConclusionsThe cheap looks loud fan and lack of power for a pro amp was enough for me to dislike the Monoprice 605030 Then I wondered what else you could get for so little money and there is nothing that comes close Hell if this doesnt work as an amp you would get your moneys worth in the form of chassis power supply etcPersonally I am too much of an equipment elitist to want to buy this amp I would pay more to get a quiet unit with more power and slightly better looks But you all can decide as you want
