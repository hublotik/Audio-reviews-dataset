0, LKV PWR3  Because the amplifier has a classD output stage I inserted an Audio Precision AUX0025 passive lowpass filter between the test load and the analyzer This filter mitigates RF noise that would otherwise drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slewrate limiting Without the filter 210mV of ultrasonic noise with a center frequency of 500kHz was present at the amplifiers output terminals I used the filter for all the tests other than frequency responseBecause the PWR3 is a classD design there was no formal need to precondition it before the testing However after operating the amplifier at 18 the specified power into 8 ohms for 20 minutes the top panel was slightly warm its temperature measuring 942°F346°CThe LKV PWR3 preserved absolute polarity ie was noninverting and its voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was slightly higher than the specified 26dB at 2636dB The singleended input impedance is specified as a very high 200k ohms I measured 290k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz decreasing inconsequentially to a still very high 156k ohms at 20kHzThe PWR3s output impedance was impressively low at 004 ohms at low and middle frequencies 007 ohms at the top of the audioband  The variation in the amplifiers smallsignal frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker  response was therefore inconsequential The LKV amplifier rolled off sharply above 30kHz the –3dB frequency lying close to 60kHz The PWR3s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  featured a critically damped overshoot but no ringingFig1 LKV PWR3 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 LKV PWR3 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe PWR3s channel separation  was modest at 63–70dB in both directions The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  was excellent at 81dB  This ratio improved to a superb 958dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 9975dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noisefloor while the LKV amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  revealed that as well as the very low level of random noise ACrelated spuriae lay at or below –110dB This is a very quiet amplifierFig3 LKV PWR3 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms LKV specifies the PWR3s maximum continuous power  as 175W into 8 ohms  360W into 4 ohms  and 225W into 2 ohms  With our usual definition of clipping—when the THDnoise reaches 1—and with both channels driven I measured a clipping power of 172Wpc into 8 ohms  and 305Wpc into 4 ohms  With one channel driven the PWR3 clipped at 500W into 2 ohms  The increase in THDN above powers of 1–2W in these graphs suggests that the amplifier uses a limited amount of loop negative feedbackFig4 LKV PWR3 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 LKV PWR3 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 LKV PWR3 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsFig7 shows how the percentage of THDnoise varies with frequency into 8 4 and 2 ohms at 1414V  Commendably the THDN percentage was low and didnt increase as the load impedance was reducedFig7 LKV PWR3 THDN  vs frequency at 1414V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The third harmonic was the highest in level  with the second harmonic about 12dB lower  Even at the high power into 4 ohms I used to create this graph the third harmonic lay at a relatively low –60dB with higherorder odd harmonics all below –96dB With the PWR3 driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms  the 1kHz difference product lay at –80dB  While the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were 10dB higher that is still relatively low in levelFig8 LKV PWR3 left channel 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 009 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 LKV PWR3 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100Wpc into 4 ohms Fig10 LKV PWR3 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms Not only does LKVs PWR3 offer high power coupled with very low noise and primarily loworder distortion its linearity is independent of load impedance This is unusual and commendable
