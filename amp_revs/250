Amazon Echo Link Amp power amplifier DAC network streamer I purchased Amazon USD 299 arrived yesterdayWhile rather featureless front overall feel plastic case quite goodWhen rotate volume control white LEDs light show coarse volume control They time quickly though I could capture cameraNot sure hole Maybe remote control none providedThe back panel interesting bitIn addition power amplifier nice little DAC preamplifier There digital inputs form Coax Toslink SPDIF And course also streaming capability Ethernet jack wifi Surprisingly also SPDIF Toslink output digital connectivity DACs amplifiersThere analog input output Former used analog gear latter use DAC preamp There issues mode though See later measurement sectionOperationally Link Amp runs cool However higher power audible mechanical hissing sound likely caused resonance internal inductor It audible 3 feet away without use speakers As imagine product Amazon name professional looking label underneath every regulatory safety certification would want see This important Link Amp like many power amplifiers mains operated lot high power circuits Oddly power buttonSadly hardly documentation provided unit You supposed seek help Alexa app I naively assumed connecting ethernet cable would mean Link Amp wout get instantly recognized app case I configure using Wifi mess connecting local adhoc wifi creates using main home network Process quite nonintuitive took multiple reboots phone link amp get finally recognize Boy I miss simplicity original echo Oddly Alexa app provides control inputs I fed SPDIF output Ditto analog Cant tell priority use activeThere volume control app controls localstreaming content volume control Amp Really The volume control digital cant I control appAmazon really lost way respect software Added complexity time managedAlso fault computer networking industry invented new revision Wifi standard works devices like thisOverall impression hardware positive software negativeAnyway lets get measurements With much functionality I chosen subset test mostly focusing amplifier performanceDAC MeasurementsI happy see line thought check performance DAC way Alas meant without load amplifier shuts turn volume max get nominal voltage like see DAC There software option turn power amp doesnt So I connect dummy loads amp test Here outcomeThe power amplifier reduced performance 5 dB SINAD 92 dB without load The current values put Link Amp lower tier DACs testedIt would gone tier higher I didnt run power amplifier along itHere DAC frequency response promoted later test resultsThe 441 kHz sampling results fine What fine matter sample rate use get bandwidth In words higher sample rates accepted everything seems sampled 441 48 kHz So forget dreams high resolution audioPower Amplifier MeasurementsImportant note get section testing results complete mess lower frequencies The graphs literally readable high variations THDN So I spent hours son working turned classD amps cause frequency modulation low frequencies throws analyzer notch filter The result THDN would go correct value 20 would totally screw things graph I found good workaround made measurements look lot nicer Alas means cant quite compare results previous measurements issue visible Fortunately clean amplifiers Hypex NC400 without issue results standLets start power amplifier dashboard st 5 watts using digital inputWhen SONOS Amp lot degradation analog input lets test thatAh sigh relief Performance actually improves bit using analog Noise floor flatter lower although enough make SINAD different Putting value context power amplifiers tested get thisI updated graph digital input SONOS nicely outperforms Link Amp However noted analog input Amazon Link Amp much betterFrequency response digital input shows bandwidth limitation DAC didSame test analog input shows droop low frequencies wellNote even using analog input limited 24 kHz bandwidth Someone didnt want mess high resolution audio matter That aside low frequency roll tooHere signal noise ratioLets deal important test power output versus distortion noiseCompared budget amps like 199 Topping TP60 much power lower noise distortion Dont like one channel distortion thoughA direct competitor SONOS amp costs twice much otherwise streaming functionalityThe Link Amp better noise level SONOS poor performance analog input The SONOS tons power two channels staying synch So SONOS better deal putting cost aside Of course neither comes remotely close reference Hypex NC400 DIY build There interest running jitter tests power amplifiers So snapshot thatThe THDN versus level frequency new tests show much cleaner resultsNote I limited bandwidth 61 kHz That enough capture third harmonic 20 kHz low enough keep ultrasonic noise amps I show bit Here see distortion rises low high frequencies The curve though matches hearing works much less sensitive low high frequencies distortion products likely audibly problem Note testing 1 khz shows best case scenario class D amplifiersI another variation I sweep levelpower keep frequency sameWe see 20000 Hz two channels perform But soon lower test 2000 Hz 200 Hz one channel gets lot worse This tells insufficient power supply capacitor reserve one channel The lower frequencies taxing way stay extreme peaks sine wave longerLastly ultrasonic spectrum 1 kHz toneWe see sharp spike around 600 kHz indicating switching frequency The rise ultrasonics around 100 khz shows noise shaping Levels quite low classD amps go showing good attention filtering doubt helped limited bandwidth 24 kHzConclusionsMechanically safety emissions point view Amazon Echo Link amp delivers 299 This puts way ahead many offerings price range akin DIY efforts polished product On top streaming DAC digital analog preamplifier This lot I suspect Amazon losing money one barely breaking evenWhile attention paid produce performant product clear limitations issues Limiting bandwidth 24 khz modes miss objectively subjectively As class D amps odd behavior rise low frequency distortion ultrasonic noiseThe mechanical whistling amp pushed caught fixed although practice music mask wellAt 299 many features generally good performance I going go ahead put Amazon Echo Link Amp recommended list No audiophile find But secondary use performance good enough make good buy
