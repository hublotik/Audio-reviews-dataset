0, of Amazon Echo Link Amp power amplifier DAC and network streamer I purchased this from Amazon for USD 299 and it arrived yesterdayWhile rather featureless from front the overall feel of the plastic and case is quite goodWhen you rotate the volume control white LEDs light up to show a coarse volume control They time out very quickly though so I could not capture them on the cameraNot sure what the hole is for Maybe it is for a remote control but none was providedThe back panel is the more interesting bitIn addition to the power amplifier we have a nice little DAC and preamplifier here There are digital inputs in the form of both Coax and Toslink SPDIF And of course we also have streaming capability with the Ethernet jack and wifi Surprisingly we also have SPDIF and Toslink output for digital connectivity to other DACs and amplifiersThere is analog input and output Former can be used for your analog gear and the latter for use as a DAC or preamp There are issues with this mode though See later in measurement sectionOperationally the Link Amp runs very cool However at higher power there is an audible mechanical hissing sound likely caused by resonance of an internal inductor It was audible to me from 3 feet away without use of speakers As you can imagine for a product with Amazon name of it there is a professional looking label underneath with every regulatory and safety certification you would want to see This is important as the Link Amp like many other power amplifiers is mains operated with a lot of high power circuits Oddly there is no power buttonSadly there is hardly any documentation provided with the unit You are supposed to seek help in the Alexa app I naively assumed that connecting ethernet cable would mean the Link Amp wout get instantly recognized by the app but such was not the case I had to configure it using Wifi with the mess that is connecting to local adhoc wifi it creates and then using the main home network Process was quite nonintuitive and took multiple reboots of phone and link amp to get it to finally recognize it Boy do I miss the simplicity of the original echo Oddly Alexa app provides no control over inputs I just fed it SPDIF and it output that Ditto for analog Cant tell what priority it will use if both are activeThere is a volume control in the app but it only controls localstreaming content not the volume control on the Amp Really The volume control is digital so why cant I control it in the appAmazon has really lost its way here with respect to software here Added complexity over time has not been managedAlso at fault is the computer and networking industry that has not invented a new revision of Wifi standard that just works with devices like thisOverall my impression of hardware is positive and software negativeAnyway lets get into measurements With so much functionality here I have chosen a subset to test mostly focusing on the amplifier performanceDAC MeasurementsI was happy to see line out so thought we can check the performance of the DAC this way Alas this was not meant to be as without a load the amplifier shuts down when you turn up the volume to max to get the nominal voltage you like to see on a DAC There should be a software option to turn off the power amp so it doesnt do that So I had to connect my dummy loads to the amp to test it Here is the outcomeThe power amplifier reduced performance by about 5 dB SINAD was 92 dB or so without the load The current values put the Link Amp in the lower tier of DACs testedIt would have gone into a tier higher if I didnt have to run the power amplifier along with itHere is the DAC frequency response which was promoted by later test resultsThe 441 kHz sampling results are fine What is not fine is that no matter what other sample rate you use you get the same bandwidth In other words while higher sample rates are accepted everything seems to be down sampled to 441 or 48 kHz So forget any dreams you have of high resolution audioPower Amplifier MeasurementsImportant note before we get into this section during testing the results were a complete mess at lower frequencies The graphs were literally not readable with very high variations of THDN So I spent a few hours with my son working through it and turned out some of these classD amps cause frequency modulation at low frequencies which throws off the analyzer notch filter The result was that THDN would go from correct value to 20 which would totally screw things up on the graph I found a good workaround for this which made the measurements look a lot nicer Alas this means you cant quite compare these results to previous measurements where this issue was visible Fortunately we had very clean amplifiers such as Hypex NC400 without this issue so those results standLets start with power amplifier dashboard st 5 watts using digital inputWhen  SONOS Amp there was a lot of degradation with analog input so lets test thatAh a sigh of relief Performance actually improves a bit using analog in Noise floor is flatter and lower although not enough to make the SINAD any different Putting that value in context of other power amplifiers tested we get thisI updated this graph with the digital input of SONOS which nicely outperforms the Link Amp However as noted with analog input the Amazon Link Amp is much betterFrequency response with digital input shows the same bandwidth limitation that the DAC didSame test with analog input shows a droop at low frequencies as wellNote that even when using analog input you are limited to the same 24 kHz bandwidth Someone didnt want you to mess with high resolution audio no matter what That aside there is now a low frequency roll off tooHere is the signal to noise ratioLets deal with the most important test power output versus distortion and noiseCompared to other budget amps like the 199 Topping TP60 there is much more power here and at lower noise and distortion Dont like one channel having more distortion thoughA more direct competitor is the SONOS amp which costs twice as much but otherwise has streaming functionalityThe Link Amp has better noise level but that is because SONOS has poor performance with its analog input The SONOS has tons more power and its two channels are staying in synch So the SONOS is a better deal here putting the cost aside Of course neither comes remotely close to our reference Hypex NC400 DIY build There has been some interest in running jitter tests on these power amplifiers So here is a snapshot of thatThe THDN versus level and frequency where my new tests show much cleaner resultsNote that I have limited the bandwidth to 61 kHz That is enough to capture the third harmonic of 20 kHz but low enough to keep the ultrasonic noise that these amps have I will show that in a bit Here we see that distortion rises with low and high frequencies The curve though matches how our hearing works in that we are much less sensitive in low and high frequencies so the distortion products are likely not audibly a problem Note then that testing at 1 khz shows the best case scenario for these class D amplifiersI have another variation of above where I sweep the levelpower and keep the frequency the sameWe see that at 20000 Hz the two channels perform the same But as soon as we lower the test to 2000 Hz and then 200 Hz one channel gets a lot worse This tells me there is insufficient power supply capacitor reserve for one channel than for the other The lower frequencies are more taxing this way because they stay at their extreme peaks of the sine wave longerLastly here is our ultrasonic spectrum of a 1 kHz toneWe see our sharp spike around 600 kHz indicating that is the switching frequency The rise in ultrasonics around 100 khz shows noise shaping  Levels for these are quite low as classD amps go showing good attention to filtering no doubt helped with the limited bandwidth of 24 kHzConclusionsMechanically and from safety and emissions point of view Amazon Echo Link amp delivers for just 299 This puts it way ahead of many offerings in this price range which are more akin to DIY efforts than a polished product On top of that you have streaming DAC and a digital and analog preamplifier This is a lot and I suspect Amazon is losing money on each one or barely breaking evenWhile some attention has been paid to produce a performant product there are clear limitations and issues here and there Limiting of the bandwidth to 24 khz in all modes is a miss objectively but not subjectively As with other class D amps we have odd behavior here and there such as rise in low frequency distortion ultrasonic noiseThe mechanical whistling while the amp is pushed should have been caught and fixed although in practice the music should mask that wellAt 299 with so many features and generally good performance I am going to go ahead and put the Amazon Echo Link Amp on my recommended list No it is no audiophile find But for secondary use its performance is good enough to make it a good buy
