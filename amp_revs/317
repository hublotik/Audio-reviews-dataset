0, Nubert nuConnect ampX digital integrated amplifier and wireless connector It was purchased by a member from the company in Germany and drop shipped to me The ampX costs â‚¬689 The outside imparts confidence as far as weight and industrial designBeauty is skin deep though The menu structure is very strange For example you hit the return button to get into options and then rotate the number to select Hitting return gets you back one step but never back to home menu above You have to select Volume and click on that to get back home I had the volume too high once as soon as I changed inputs and could not turn it down immediatelyWhen you turn the unit off with the standby button on the left a dim display remains saying ampX I hope that is not an OLED display or that would be burnt in after a short while Why do I need to see that text on the display The standby button already turns orangeThe rear panel shows the plethora of option to feed the ampXYou have phono state Bluetooth and Wifi besides allt he other inputs Whats more using their app and the microphone in the phone you are supposed to be able to correct for room modes under 160 Hz Audio MeasurementsI started with our usual dashboard with USB input to ampX and speaker out at 5 wattsBoy this is not good We have high noise floor plus ton sand tons of harmonics and we are at just 5 watts I thought may be analog input would be different so tested thatIt is a different sort of bad but overall in the same bucket of well below averageSignal to noise ratio is verypoorNever seen an amplifier that doesnt improve its signal to noise ratio when you turn it up The noise must be getting amplified proportionally with volume32tone test signal resembling music shows the same problemsLook at those spikes in mid frequencies rising to almost 50 dB This is where our hearing is starting to get most sensitiveFrequency response was terrible with digital or analog inputsThere is a high pass filter which I could not figure how to defeat so let it be at 10 Hz It must cause that terrible peaking at low frequencies Conversely there is a sharp filter at 20 kHz which roll off starting even earlier We are down 3 dB by the time we get to 20 kHz And this is with digital input and sample rate of 96 kHzLets test the power amp to full power starting at 4 ohmThat is a lot worse than a typical AVR Same is true with 8 ohm loadThermal AnalysisPerformance improved a bit over half of running at 5 wattsConclusionsI tell you if manufacturers post measurements I am sure they would have caught these issues themselves Even a marketing person would know the above frequency response would not sell a single unit But no Customers dont ask for it so manufactures just throw a few numbers over the fence Those numbers did point to problemsWe actually did better at 005 How they got this SNR I dont know ConclusionsI get the appeal of do it all amplifier with modern streaming features But come on Lets get the basics right The amp needs to be low noise and distortion and have flat response And spend some time make the unit easier to navigateNeedless to say I cannot recommend the Nubert nuConnect ampX It had high promise but did not remotely get there
