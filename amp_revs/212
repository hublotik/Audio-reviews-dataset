0, March Audio P122 class D Hypex based stereo power amplifier    The P122 costs US 750 Due to my relationship with company owner I wont be performing a review or providing a recommendation one way or the other So dont look for panthers on pictures eitherThe P122 uses similar packaging to the rest of March Audio productsThere is just a touch button that turns the unit on and off The back panel has very nice and really long speaker terminalsIn use the P122 never complained or get warm It passed all the tests without going into protection modePower supply is switching as noted on the unit so works as is worldwideAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm loadAs noted on the THDN panel performance is roughly the same as the spec in one channel and slightly better in the other Distortion and noise combined is near top of classSignal to noise ratio is excellentCrosstalk is respectable as wellFrequency response is good but not flat out to infinity as some amps areMultitone test shows a few odd spikes in mid frequenciesBut levels are nearly 100 dB down so not a cause for concernAmplifier Power MeasurementsLets start with 4 ohmWe are a bit shy of the specification on power but distortion and noise is much better than typical mass market product Same is true of 8 ohm loadNot sure what explains the shortfall in power These amplifiers have regulated switching power supplies so usually dont produce more power than continuousConclusionsWhile the power level is on the low side the performance is much better than typical brand name amplifiers
