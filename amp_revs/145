0, Bluesound Powernode  then repeated some tests with the magazines more recent APx500 system I connected the Powernode to my network and controlled it with the Bluesound app on my iPad mini  I used the apps Customize Inputs screen to disable AV mode on the inputs with which I was going to do the testing as this is said to be best for audioonly sourcesAs the amplifier has a classD output stage I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter between the test load and the analyzers This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive their input circuitry into slewrate limiting I used it for all the loudspeaker output tests other than frequency response After two hours of operation the temperature of the amplifier chassis was only slightly warmer than room temperature at 939°F  on the bottom panel a few degrees lower in temperature on the top panelI looked first at the Bluesounds performance via its singleended analog inputs The input impedance was a relatively low 7k ohms at 20Hz dropping slightly to 64k ohms at 20kHz The maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 34dB with the tone controls bypassed it was 6dB lower with the controls active but set to 0dB At the headphone output the gain was –315dB ie an input of 1V resulted in an output of 696mV The Powernode preserved absolute polarity from both the speaker and headphone outputsThe Bluesound amplifiers output impedance at the headphone output was a very low 1 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz The output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 01 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising very slightly to 012 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore negligible at ±01dB  The response into resistive loads  and from the headphone output rolled off rapidly above 20kHz which suggests that the Powernode digitizes its analog inputs most probably with a sample rate of 441kHz The rolloff meant that the Bluesounds reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was a pure sinewave  A 1kHz squarewave was reproduced with ringing on its leading edges  confirming that there is analogdigital conversionFig1 Bluesound PowerNode volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms   Fig2 Bluesound PowerNode smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Bluesound PowerNode smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe bass and treble controls offered a maximum boost and cut of ±6dB  which explains the 6dB reduction in maximum gain with them active Fig4 Bluesound PowerNode frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum and switched out of circuit Channel separation was okay at 60dB in both directions below 15kHz but 40dB at the top of the audioband Without the auxiliary lowpass filter there was 220mV of ultrasonic noise present at the loudspeaker outputs With the filter the Bluesounds unweighted wideband signal noise ratio taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum was good at 644dB ref 283V into 8 ohms  This ratio improved slightly to 65dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 745dB when Aweighted The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics  The blue and red traces in this graph were taken with the volume control set to the maximum Reducing the volume by 20dB lowered the levels of the 60Hz component by the same 20dB and the higherorder harmonics disappeared beneath the random noisefloorFig5 Bluesound PowerNode spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms volume control set to maximum  and to –20dB With both channels driven the Powernode met its specified continuous maximum power into 8 ohms of 80Wpc  at 1 THDnoise  However very little more power was available into 4 ohms the Bluesound clipping at 84Wpc into that load  I didnt test clipping power into 2 ohms as the amplifier isnt specified into that load The distortion lies below the noisefloor at low powers so I examined how the THDN varied with frequency at 1265V which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms and 40W into 4 ohms Fig8 shows that the distortion at low frequencies is the same into both impedances at 002–003 It does rise at higher frequencies with some peculiar frequencydependent behavior in the top octaveFig6 Bluesound PowerNode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig7 Bluesound PowerNode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig8 Bluesound PowerNode THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion was predominantly loworder harmonics  which was confirmed by the spectrum of the Powernodes output when it drove a 50Hz tone at 20Wpc into 8 ohms  The subjectively benign second and third harmonics are the highest in level each lying at –80dB  The second harmonic rose a little at the same voltage into 4 ohms  though the third dropped slightly When the Bluesound amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 20W peak into 8 ohms all the intermodulation products lay at or below –80dB  in both channels  The digitizing results in aliased images of the tone at 241kHz and 251kHz confirming that the AD converter operates at 441kHzFig9 Bluesound PowerNode 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms 0053 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Bluesound PowerNode spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 20W into 8 ohms Fig11 Bluesound PowerNode HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms  Bluesound Powernodes DA performance primarily using its TosLink SPDIF input repeating some of the tests with WAV files on a USB drive plugged into the rearpanel USB port I initially performed the measurements at the headphone output then repeated some tests at the loudspeaker outputThe Bluesound Powernodes optical input locked to data sampled up to 192kHz and absolute polarity was preserved with this input and with WAV files on the USB stick With the volume control set to its maximum 1kHz digital data at –20dBFS resulted in a level at the headphone output of 144mV and at the loudspeaker outputs of 1029V The latter is 79dB below the Bluesounds clipping voltage into 8 ohms It appears therefore that the digital inputs have around 12dB of excess gain I therefore continued the testing with the volume control set to –12dB to avoid driving the output stage into clipping with highlevel digital signalsThe impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a minimumphase type with all the ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the Powernodes response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression at 24kHz just above half the sample rate  The aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  is suppressed by 56dB and the distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone all lie at or below –70dB Some odd lowlevel noisefloor modulation is present in the spectrum of the 191kHz tone which was taken at the loudspeaker outputs This behavior was absent when I repeated the measurement at the headphone output but the tones third harmonic had risen to –40dB Fig12 Bluesound PowerNode Toslink input impulse response Fig13 Bluesound PowerNode Toslink input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz The digitalinput frequency response with 441kHz data was flat in the audioband with then a sharp rolloff just below half the sample rate  The levels of the two channels were perfectly matched The highfrequency rolloff doesnt seem as steep with 96kHz data  and 192kHz data  but this is due to the presence of aliased imagesFig14 Bluesound PowerNode Toslink input frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noisefloor dropped by 10dB which implies that the Powernode offers close to 18 bits worth of resolution With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were obscured by highfrequency noise Intermodulation distortion via the Bluesounds digital inputs measured at the loudspeaker outputs  was very similar to the behavior with analog input signals It was higher at the headphone output however the difference product at 1kHz lying at –70dB compared with –84dBFig15

jitter via its TosLink and USB inputs The oddorder harmonics of the 16bit JTest signals LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were obscured by the random noisefloor with both the loudspeaker outputs and the headphone output However the noise sidebands centered at ±1166Hz in the loudspeaker spectrum  were absent from the headphone outputFig18 Bluesound PowerNode Toslink input highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit data  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzTo some extent the Bluesound Powernodes measured performance is affected by noise contamination from the classD output stage Overall however it did well on the testbench especially considering its affordable price
