0, Krell Solo 575    Before measuring it  amplifier by running it at onethird the specified power 190W into 8 ohms for 30 minutes  The amplifiers cooling fans turned on immediately at this power level and were noisier than I was anticipating At the end of 30 minutes the top panel was warm only the slotted area where the fans vent was hot at 1374°F  The percentage of THDnoise at this power level was 0009 with the amplifier cold 00088 with it fully warmed upThe Solo 575s voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 265dB with both balanced and unbalanced input signals  Unusually the Krell inverted absolute polarity for both its balanced and unbalanced inputs Although the specified input impedance was very high at 100k ohms unbalanced and 200k ohms balanced the measured impedance was very much lower at close to 49k ohms for both inputs across the audioband This is not an amplifier that should be used with capacitorcoupled tube preamplifiers though it would not have been a problem with MFs darTZeel preamp The output impedance was very low at 009 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 011 ohm at 20kHz As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker  was very low The Solo 575s smallsignal bandwidth was wide with a –3dB frequency greater than 100kHz The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was therefore essentially perfect  with short rise times and no overshoot or ringing The unbalanced frequency response  was identical at high frequencies but had a small  rise at 10Hz Measured with the balanced input shorted to ground the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was very good at 782dB ref 283V into 8 ohms With an Aweighting filter the SN improved to 891dB Considering its very high output power  this is a high–dynamicrange amplifier Looking at the lowfrequency noise floor as the Krell drove a 1kHz tone at 283V into 8 ohms While some powersupply–related spuriae can be seen  even the highest in level at 120Hz lies at just –100dB Fig1 Krell Solo 575 balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Krell Solo 575 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Krell Solo 575 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Figs 4 and 5 respectively plot the THDN percentage in the Solo 575s output against power in watts into 8 and 4 ohms Although the Krells specified maximum power into these loads is very high at a respective 575W  and 900W  the amplifier exceeded those powers clipping at 625W into 8 ohms  and 910W into 4 ohms   Although I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests the Solo 575 clipped at 1050W into 2 ohms  This is a powerhouse of an amplifierFig4 Krell Solo 575 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Krell Solo 575 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsIt also offers very low distortion I plotted how the THDN percentage changes with frequency at a level—1265V equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms 40W into 4 ohms and 80W into 2 ohms—at which I could be sure that I was measuring actual distortion not noise Even so the level of distortion was very low  especially into 8 ohms and rose only slightly at the top of the audiobandFig6 Krell Solo 575 THDN  vs frequency at 1265V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms And that distortion was almost purely thirdharmonic in nature  with some higherorder odd harmonics appearing at high powers and low frequencies  Even so other than the third harmonic at –80dB  these all lay at or below –90dB  Intermodulation distortion was similarly low Fig7 Krell Solo 575 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00068 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Krell Solo 575 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 300W into 4 ohms Fig9 Krell Solo 575 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 150W peak into 8 ohms It is difficult not to be impressed by how Krells Solo 575 measured Amplifiers dont get much better
