NAD C268 power amplifier balanced inputs It kindly sent costs US 900 NAD dealers The C268 built Hypex UcD Class D amplifier modules testing get coverage well Then NAD says custom version themThe front panel looks good substantialThe unit nice light move around inside fair amount space Back panel nice way provides balanced XLR unbalanced RCA input together gain controlFor testing I used fixed gain mode get around channel differential potentiometers may introduceSpeaker terminals nice easy use naturally unit properly certified safety emissions Keep later mind compare DIY version amplifier modules With anything mains input I highly recommend sticking products safety certificationsIn use amplifier runs completely cool touch Not even room temperature seems It never ever shut matter I This one reasons buy separate amplifier way These power amplifiers far robust home theater AVRStereo Amplifier MeasurementsHere usual dashboard feed amplifier simple 1 kHz sine wavetone ask produce 5 watts 4 ohm load This getFor reason channel blue much second harmonic causing SINAD sum distortion noise suffer 5 dB There always differential stereo channels bit much This aside performance average SINAD 87 dB averaged Covering basics frequency response goodCrosstalk shape unusual fortunately gives near stateoftheart performance hearing sensitiveNoise performance good You easily clear CDstreaming contents 16 bit dynamic range almost listening levelGetting fancy using 32tones test distortionintermodulation get already seen dashboard goodA power amplifiers job well produce power lets measure starting 4 ohm loadNAD rates amplifier 80 watts 4 8 ohm loads unusual Fortunately beating 4 ohm load getting 96 wattsAs noted earlier noise performance good indicated low red graphs distortion sets graph starts flatten rise But hit hard wall end This amp sound good doesnt You instantly know power limit good badThere hidden good news though Lets measure power 1 distortionnoise continuous burstWow many switching amplifiers dont produce much power burst mode Here getting double power tune 230 watts channels driven This means momentary musical peaks much power available standard nonburst tests showSwitching 8 ohms get company advertisesAll power tests one frequency 1 kHz Lets run power sweep 4 ohm load vary frequencyWith class D amps I expect lines many different shapes place Instead land right top ideal response If look right clipping occurs though see two ends spectrum 20 20000 Hz power get limited 20 kHz doesnt need much power music spectrum quite low But 20 Hz loss power unfortunate common The peaks low frequencies last due slow speed taxes power supply causing run juice lower power levelsAmplifier Bridged Mode PerformanceI usually dont test bridged mode knowing rascals immediately ask since NAD emphasizes lot So lets reconfigure amp single channel see getCompany advertises 300 watts likely higher distortion I use graph To approximate performance lets use 1 THDN threshold measure againNow get 300 watts continuous And better yet get close half kilowatt power peaks Nicely doneConclusionsThe value proposition NAD C268 amplifier doesnt look good first blush Just 80 watts per channel 900 Testing shows less continuous power level short duration amplifier provide far power Combined nice safe build quality C268 heartAs I going put NAD C268 recommended list
