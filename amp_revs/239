0, NAD C268 power amplifier with balanced inputs It is kindly sent to me by  costs US 900 at NAD dealers  The C268 is built on Hypex UcD Class D amplifier modules so in testing it we will get coverage on that as well Then again NAD says it is a custom version for themThe front panel looks good and substantialThe unit is nice and light to move around and inside has fair amount of space Back panel is nice in the way it provides both balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA input together with gain controlFor my testing I used the fixed gain mode to get around any channel differential the potentiometers may introduceSpeaker terminals are nice and easy to use and naturally the unit is properly certified for safety and emissions Keep the later in mind as you compare it with any DIY version of the same amplifier modules With anything with mains input I highly recommend sticking with products with safety certificationsIn use the amplifier runs completely cool to touch Not even above room temperature it seems It never ever shut down no matter what I did to it This is one of the reasons you buy a separate amplifier by the way These power amplifiers are far more robust than any in any home theater AVRStereo Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard where we feed the amplifier a simple 1 kHz sine wavetone and ask it to produce 5 watts into 4 ohm load  This is what we getFor some reason the channel in blue has much more second harmonic causing its SINAD  which is a sum of distortion and noise  to suffer by 5 dB There is always some differential between stereo channels but this is a bit much This aside performance is above average with a SINAD of 87 dB once averaged Covering the basics frequency response is very goodCrosstalk  shape is unusual but fortunately it gives is near stateoftheart performance where our hearing  is most sensitiveNoise performance is very good You easily clear the CDstreaming contents 16 bit dynamic range at almost any listening levelGetting fancy and using 32tones to test for distortionintermodulation we get what we already seen from the dashboard which is goodA power amplifiers job is well to produce power so lets measure that starting with 4 ohm loadNAD rates the amplifier at 80 watts for both 4 and 8 ohm loads which is unusual Fortunately we are beating that with our 4 ohm load getting 96 wattsAs noted earlier noise performance is very good as indicated by how low the red graphs are until distortion sets in and the graph starts to flatten and rise But then we hit a very hard wall at the end This is an amp that will sound good until it doesnt You will instantly know its power limit for good or badThere is some hidden good news here though Lets measure power at 1 distortionnoise both continuous  and burstWow many switching amplifiers dont produce much more power in burst mode Here we are getting more than double the power to the tune of 230 watts while both channels driven This means for momentary musical peaks you have much more power available than our standard nonburst tests showSwitching to 8 ohms we get what the company advertisesAll of these power tests are at just one frequency 1 kHz Lets now run the same power sweep into 4 ohm load but vary the frequencyWith class D amps I expect these lines to have many different shapes and be all of the place Instead they land right on top of each other which is an ideal response If you look to the right before clipping occurs though you see that at the two ends of the spectrum  20 and 20000 Hz  power does get limited 20 kHz doesnt need much power as music spectrum is quite low But 20 Hz does and loss of power is unfortunate but very common The peaks at low frequencies last a while due to their slow speed  which taxes the power supply causing it to run out of juice at lower power levelsAmplifier Bridged Mode PerformanceI usually dont test bridged mode but knowing you rascals you will immediately ask for it since NAD emphasizes this a lot So lets reconfigure the amp into a single channel and see what we getCompany advertises 300 watts but that is likely at higher distortion than what I use in the above graph To approximate their performance lets use the 1 THDN threshold again and measure againNow we get the 300 watts continuous And better yet we get close to half a kilowatt of power for peaks Nicely doneConclusionsThe value proposition of the NAD C268 amplifier doesnt look very good at first blush Just 80 watts per channel for 900 Testing shows while that is more or less the continuous power level for short duration the amplifier can provide far more power Combined with the nice and safe build quality the C268 won my heartAs such I am going to put the NAD C268 on my recommended list
