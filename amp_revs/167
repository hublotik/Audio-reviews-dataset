0, Devialet Expert 140 Pro   The amplifier as received was set to High Pass 10Hz Max Level 20V I usually precondition amplifiers by running them at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour which is thermally the worst case for a classAB output stage As the Devialet has a  digital output stage the preconditioning wasnt necessary Nevertheless the amplifier ran warm with the top panel measuring 1199°F  an hour or so into the testing The menus internal temperature function indicated the message Temp A Amp 61°C Temp D Amp 57°C Temp Supply 65°C The Expert 140 Pro should be positioned where it is wellventilatedAs I always do with classD amplifiers I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz between the test load This eliminates the risk of driving the analyzers input stage into slewrate limiting which would interfere with the distortion measurements Without the Audio Precision filter there was 120mV of ultrasonic noise present at the amplifiers outputsLooking first at the unbalanced linelevel analog inputs the Devialets voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum of 30 was 485dB which is a little higher than is usual for an integrated amplifier The gain with the control set to 00 was exactly 30dB lower The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with Phase set to  My measurements indicated an input impedance of a suitably high 165k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz this dropping inconsequentially to 157k ohms at 20kHzThe output impedance is specified as an extraordinarily low 0001 ohms I measured a stilllow 005 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz this figure including the series impedance of 6 of loudspeaker cable As a result the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by less than ±005dB  and the response into 2 ohms  was almost identical to that into 8 and 4 ohms  As expected from the settings the lowfrequency response was –3dB at 10Hz The output into 2 ohms  was down by just 0125dB at 20kHzFig1 Devialet Expert 140 Pro frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  and simulated loudspeaker  This graph was taken with the volume control set to 00 and neither the response nor the close channelmatching changed at different settings of the control However the Devialet amplifiers output rolls rapidly above 40kHz and its reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave  featured the symmetrical ringing indicative of a linearphase digital filter The 140 Pro digitizes its analog input with a sample rate of 96kHz—although the sample rate is said to be switchable between 96kHz and 192kHz I wasnt able to change it from 96kHz—meaning that a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with just the third harmonic at 30kHz present Fig2 Devialet Expert 140 Pro smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Devialet Expert 140 Pro smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was good at 90dB in both directions across most of the audioband but when I looked at the crosstalk waveform on an oscilloscope it was apparent that the measurement was dominated by noise This higherthanusual level of noise can be seen in fig4 which shows a spectral analysis of the Devialets lowfrequency noise floor While the individual FFT bins in this graph lie at or below –80dB it suggests that the 140 Pros analog inputs are limited to 14bit resolution With the filter the wideband unweighted SN ratio ref 283V and measured with the volume control at 00 and the input shorted to ground was 595dB which improved to 68dB when Aweighted  The level of random noise increased as the volume control setting was raised above 00 The Aweighted ratio with the control set to 30 for example measured 385dB ie 305dB worseFig4 Devialet Expert 140 Pro spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to 00  The Devialets maximum power is specified as 140W into 6 ohms  I dont have a 6 ohm test load but with clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 I found that the 140 Pro clipped at 103W into 8 ohms  and 205W into 4 ohms Fig5 Devialet Expert 140 Pro distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Devialet Expert 140 Pro distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe Devialets THDN at full power is specified as just 00005 The downward slope of the traces in figs5 and 6 suggests that the measurement is actually just showing noise up to the point when the waveform starts to clip  I havent included a graph showing how THDN percentage varies with frequency therefore as this graph would be dominated by noise The waveform of the residual distortion and noise is just random noise  But figs5 and 6 indicate that the minimum THDN percentage is just 002 into both 8 and 4 ohmsFig7 Devialet Expert 140 Pro 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 002 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out The spectrum of the Devialets output while I drove a lowfrequency tone at a moderately high power into 8 ohms is shown in fig8 any distortion harmonics are below the level of random noise I ran into problems when I tried to test for intermodulation distortion with my usual mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones The amplifier went into protection with sustained highpower highfrequency tones reducing the output level The spectrum in fig9 was taken at 8Wpc into 4 ohms the highest power the amplifier would deliver continuously without its protection operating Though the secondorder difference product is absent some lowlevel highorder intermodulation products can be seen However the noise floor has an unusual scalloped appearanceFig8 Devialet Expert 140 Pro spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 33W into 8 ohms  Fig9 Devialet Expert 140 Pro HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 8W peak into 4 ohms  Turning to the digital inputs Apples USB Prober utility identified the Devialet amplifier as Expert Pro USB Audio 20 from DEVIALET and indicated that the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that via USB the 140 Pro accepted 16 and 24bit integer data sampled at all rates from 441 to 192kHz All the digital inputs preserved absolute polarity With the Devialets volume control set to 00 a 1kHz digital signal at 0dBFS resulted in a level of 2518V into 8 ohms from the speaker outputs Increasing the volume control to 25 clipped the amplifiers output with this signal so I performed most of the testing via the digital inputs with the volume control set to 00The 140 Pros impulse response with 441kHz data was a typical linearphase type with symmetrical ringing before and after the single high sample  With 441kHzsampled white noise  the Devialets response reached full stopband attenuation at 24kHz though the noise floor with this signal was higher than it was with a fullscale tone at 191kHz  The harmonics of the 191kHz tone can be seen in this graph with the third the highest in level at –63dB  The 140 Pros frequency responses with data at 441 96 and 192kHz followed the same basic shape but with a very sharp rolloff above half of each sample rate Fig10 Devialet Expert 140 Pro digital inputs impulse response Fig11 Devialet Expert 140 Pro digital inputs wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig12 Devialet Expert 140 Pro digital inputs

the left channel  meaning that the Devialets digital inputs offer almost 20 bits worth of resolution in this channel However the noise floor in the right channel  is higher than it is in the left and has an odd scalloped appearance With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical  With undithered 24bit data the result was a superbly clean sinewave Fig13 Devialet Expert 140 Pro digital inputs spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with

of noise  However a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz to the sides of the peak that represents the highlevel tone at onequarter the sample rate can be seen these power supplyrelated Note that I had to reduce the volume to –24 to make this measurement to avoid the amplifier going into protectionFig16 Devialet Expert 140 Pro highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS

moreexpensive Devialet DPremier which I reviewed favorably in January 2013 However I was bothered by the higherthanexpected level of background noise—much higher than with the DPremier—especially with the analog inputs
