0, McIntosh MAC7200   I looked first at its behavior via its balanced and singleended line inputs mostly with the volume control set to its maximum 100 then at lower settings I performed a complete set of tests from the receivers 8 ohm output transformer tap then repeated several tests from the 4 ohm and 2 ohm taps  receiver by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the heatsinks were very hot at 1518°F  After letting the MAC7200 cool down I continued the testingFor the balanced input the maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs into 8 ohms was 3825dB from the 8 ohm tap 347dB from the 4 ohm tap and 322dB from the 2 ohm tap The maximum gains from the unbalanced inputs were all 6dB higher With the jumpers that connect the preamplifier outputs to the power amplifier inputs removed the gains from the input labeled PWR AMP measured 202dB at the 8 ohm tap 167dB at the 4 ohm tap and 142dB at the 2 ohm tap From the unbalanced line input at the preamplifier and headphone outputs the maximum gain measured 154dB and 196dB respectively The MAC7200 preserved absolute polarity  at all of its outputsThe MAC7200s unbalanced line input impedance was 215k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to 19k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was 33k ohms across the audioband The power amplifier input impedance was 10k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The preamplifier output impedance was a low 220 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz increasing to 403 ohms at 20Hz the headphone output impedance was 48 ohms at all audio frequencies The McIntoshs headphone output will work best with highimpedance headphonesThe amplifiers output impedance at the 8 ohm tap was 016–019 ohms depending on frequency The 4 ohm taps output impedance was 0114 ohms that of the 2 ohm tap 012 ohms both from 20Hz to 20kHz All these measurements include the series impedance of the loudspeaker cable The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was very small even from the 8 ohm tap  The smallsignal bandwidth with the volume control set to its maximum was flat up to 20kHz from all three output transformer taps and was down by 3dB at 90kHz Channel matching was excellent and maintained at lower settings of the volume control The receivers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave from all three taps  was free from overshoot and ringingFig1 McIntosh MAC7200 8 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 McIntosh MAC7200 8 ohm tap smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 shows the effects of the treble and bass controls set to their 12 and –12 positions compared with the response with the controls bypassed While the maximum boost or cut at low frequencies was ±12dB it reached ±15dB at high frequencies Channel separation via the line inputs  was okay at just below 70dB in both directions The level of the McIntoshs noise floor depended on the volume control setting With the control set to its maximum a small number of lowlevel supplyrelated spuriae can be seen just above the random noise floor  The wideband unweighted SN ratio taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was 693dB average of both channels ref 283V output from all three output taps into 8 ohms Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the SN ratio to 780dB while switching an Aweighting filter into circuit improved it further to 806dBFig3 McIntosh MAC7200 8 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum and switched out of circuit Fig4 McIntosh MAC7200 8 ohm tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to 100 Figs5 6 and 7 plot the percentage of THDnoise in the MAC7200s speaker output from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms and the 2 ohm tap into 2 ohms In each graph the THDN continues to drop as the power decreases below actual waveform clipping due to the distortion lying beneath the noise floor and the fixed level of noise becoming an increasing percentage of the signal level The receivers maximum power is specified as being at least 200W from each of the outputtransformer taps Using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the 8 ohm tap clipped at 255W into 8 ohms  with both channels driven the 4 ohm tap at 235W into 4 ohms  with both channels driven and the 2 ohm tap at 283W into 2 ohms  with one channel driven More power was available when the load impedance was lower than the nominal tap impedance For example with its 8 ohm tap driving 4 ohms the McIntosh clipped at 340W into 4 ohms Fig5 McIntosh MAC7200 8 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 McIntosh MAC7200 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 McIntosh MAC7200 2 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsFig8 McIntosh MAC7200 8 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI measured how the MAC7200s distortion changed with frequency at 20V output which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms The THDN percentage was very low into both loads  and didnt increase at the top of the audioband As suspected from the clipping graphs the measurement was being dominated by random noise which can also be seen in the waveform of the THDN spuriae  A hint of second harmonic can be just made out in this graph which was confirmed by spectral analysis  Intermodulation distortion was also vanishingly low Fig9

peak into 8 ohms I primarily tested the McIntoshs phono input from the preamplifier output with the jumpers to the power amplifier inputs removed The moving magnet and moving coil modes both preserved absolute polarity at all outputs in all modes The MM input impedance was an appropriate 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to 396k ohms at 20kHz The MC modes input impedance had been set to 200 ohms I measured 2007 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz With the volume control set to its maximum the MM mode offered 557dB of gain at the preamplifier output and 848dB at the 8 ohm loudspeaker output The MC mode offered 20dB higher gainThe MAC7200s RIAA correction offered very low error  and was wellmatched between the channels Channel separation via the phono input was good at 70dB in both directions at all audio frequencies The phono inputs noise performance in MM mode was excellent with unweighted audioband signalnoise ratios  of 792dB  The ratios improved to 846dB when Aweighted The higher gain in the MC mode reduced the SN ratio the unweighted wideband ratio ref 1kHz at 500ÊV was 661dB and 83dB AweightedFig13 McIntosh MAC7200 phono input MM mode response with RIAA correction The MAC7200s phono input offered excellent overload margins at 225dB ref 1kHz at 5mV in MM mode and 20dB ref 1kHz at 500µV in MC mode The phono inputs distortion was very low primarily consisting of the second harmonic but this lay at just –100dB  Intermodulation distortion via the MAC7200s phono input was also extremely lowFig14 McIntosh MAC7200 phono input MM mode spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 10mV input The McIntosh MAC7200s optical and coaxial SPDIF digital inputs locked to data sampled up to 192kHz Apples USB Prober utility running on my batterypowered MacBook Pro identified the McIntosh as McIntosh HD USB Audio000 from McIntosh000  The USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode and Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that via USB the MAC7200 accepted 16 24 and 32bit integer data sampled at all rates from 32kHz to 384kHzWith the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in a level at the 8 ohm loudspeaker outputs of 3464V into 8 ohms which is equivalent to 150W into 8 ohms As is often the case with integrated amplifiers with DACs the MAC7200s digital inputs have too much gain The –20dBFS digital signal resulted in a level of 1252V at the preamplifier output and 2V at the headphone output To avoid damaging the McIntoshs power amplifier stage with highlevel digital signals I performed all the measurements of the digital inputs performance at the preamplifier output As this output clips with fullscale digital signals with the volume control set to its maximum behavior of the digital inputs with the volume control at 76 a few dB below the setting at which the distortion started to rise The preamplifier output level at this volume control setting was 315VThe McIntoshs USB and SPDIF inputs preserved absolute polarity The impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the MAC7200s response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression just above half the sample rate  An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  is suppressed by more than 110dB and though the distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone can be seen these are all very low in level The second harmonic is the highest in level at –90dB  The MAC7200s digitalinput frequency response was flat in the audioband and follows the same basic shape but with a slight peak just before the sharp rolloff at half of each sample rate Fig15 McIntosh

digital inputs frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Channel separation via the digital inputs was a very good 90dB below 1kHz When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor components dropped by around 18dB which implies that the MAC7200 offers around 19 bits worth of resolution With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved With undithered 24bit data  the result was a fairly clean sinewaveFig18 McIntosh MAC7200 digital inputs spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Intermodulation distortion via the McIntosh amplifiers digital inputs was very low but there was an odd scalloping of the noise floor either side of the twin tones at 19kHz and 20kHz  This modulation of the noise floor was also evident when  MAC7200 for its rejection of wordclock jitter via its SPDIF and USB inputs obscuring the oddorder harmonics of the 16bit JTest signals LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave Fig19 McIntosh MAC7200 digital inputs HF intermodulation spectrum

data  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzOverall the McIntosh MAC7200 performed very well on the test bench via its line inputs exceeding its specified power and offering extremely low distortion It also includes an excellent phono input that offers low noise and low distortion in both MM and MC modes However while the digital inputs offer excellent resolution I was bothered by the modulation of the noise floor with highlevel highfrequency tones  Footnote 1 This scalloping of the noise floor is probably not audible as such However it is always suspicious when a products transfer function is modified by the signal
