Accuphase E270 Integrated Amplifier friends Gig Harbor Audio It demo unit I return Tuesday So need something else measured ask right away The E270 released 2017 I think retails USD 5000 This cheap normal standards highend audio pretty reasonable priceThe industrial design unit seemingly changed 1980s era beautiful VU meters At 44 pounds unit quite heavy capabilities There massive transformer middle unit power amplifier modules beefy heatsinks sit either side During testing I could even get unit become warm let alone hot It runs comfortably one thinks never going stress outThe front slick finish lovely touch Volume control implemented resistor ladders hence electronic control Accuphase says 6500 steps plenty listening although bit difficult dial exact value measurementsThere slots back optional DAC phono stage mine All type construction look feel would justify paying good bit premium budget product Given likely reliability comes highend product Japan I say stage set good impressionNote seeing demo unit sold I NOT attempt stress unit No long term warm certainly stress test Given overdesigned thermal design though I worried measurements holding thermal stressMeasurementsFor reasons become clear later I decided test power amplifier section first Accuphase makes dead easy frontpanel button MAIN IN decouples power amp input preamp output This allowed test power amplifier separately compare performance recently tested power amps So lets start 5 watt dashboard 4 ohmI added two panels gain dc output Have verified latter correct As see 04 dB gain error variation distortion level The loads I use precision types may instrumentation I match levels distortion levels differentials remained At 92 95 dB SINAD getting territory transparency CD music The two distortion products second third harmonic around 100 dBSignal Noise ratio good 116 dBThe E270 rated 120 watts blows way past tune 155 watts prior clipping You see comparison recently reviewed Onkyo M282 The E270 outperforms every category lower noise floor distortion power prior clipping The Onkyo course budget product 300 On good news Hypex based NC400 amplifier way outshines Accuphase E270 It far less noise distortion much power Whoever thinks class AB amplifiers better switching ones like NC400 time cry PreamplifierLets isolate preamplifier measure unity gain Wow quite bit better power amplifier much lower noise floor distortion Dont get excited though There really odd things going Lets switch inputs XLRWhat heck We lost 10 dB performanceWhat really really strange I measure RCA leave XLR cables connected performance drops way You see easily signal noise ratio measurementsAccuphase hints much lower performance XLR input specs productThis aside note I shown FFT chart lots lots power supply related spikes This evident FFT spectrum Switching power supplies like used Hypex NC400 amplifier shown inset blue convert mains DC convert back AC hundreds much higher frequency As result free mains related noise good implementations There denying clean Hypex NC400 amplifier audible band The Accuphase E270 contrast cleaner budget Onkyo M282 ton noise spikesThe problematic area switching amplifiers high frequencies lets look thatThe levels noise spurious tones course quite bit lower switching amplifiers We see XLR input worse performance Lets remeasure power versus distortion using E270s preampWe repeat issues XLR input Notice performance RCA input without XLR cable connected used And course leave fair amount performance table respect power amplifier alone It seems loading preamp power amp reduces performance substantially I traced preamp getting severely distorted power amp stress There lack isolationindependent power supply preampStory intermodulation distortion versus levelInterestingly enough level sensitivity XLR RCA I able swing 4 volts output RCA 2 voltsFrequency response falls category good newsI left levels different input graphs dont fall top The power amplifier flattest response bit There really issue audible band 20 kHzConclusionsOn fit finish Accuphase E270 integrated Amplifier delivers product low thousands dollars It nostalgic look 1980s product popular certainly different common mass market products Its power amplifier respectable conservative specifications Measurements show produce far power stated massive thermal capacity spell long service lifeUnfortunately I think serious engineering issues preamplifier The XLR input generates much worse performance also serves pollute performance RCA input There sufficient powerisolation preamp causing performance sag unit asked produce lot power These faults I dont tolerate mass market products let alone higher end onesI would say want get Accuphase product get power amplifier The integrated unit tested doesnt job sadly I cannot recommend itEDIT update price correct one
