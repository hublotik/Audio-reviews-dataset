0, Rotel RB1070 stereo power amplifier It was released in early 2000 Cant find the cost then but I see it used for around 400 to 500I have always found Rotels to be most attractively designed power amplifiers One look at that front panel and you immediately think of muscle and beauty in design Alas the extruded aluminum in front which gives it that look is cosmetic There are two others internally which do the job of cooling this classic AB design In use the heastsinks got pretty warm to touch to give it some air to breathNot much news in the back other than nice inclusion of trigger inputoutputRotel RB1070 MeasurementsThe unit warmed up nicely without its performance changing muchSo lets see what our dashboard of 1 kHz tone does into 4 ohm loadThe amp is about 2 dB more sensitive than usual which likely accentuates the power supply noise a bit I was able to reduce 60 Hz hum in one channel but not simultaneously in the other That is exceeded however by the power supply noise at 120 Hz and multiples SINAD is likely dominated by distortion to the tune of 80 dB This lands the RB1070 slightly above average of all amplifiers testedDespite the power supply noise dynamic range is very goodFrequency response is excellent and spec compliantCrosstalk is goodMultitone shows no frequency dependence which is niceThere is ample power available into 4 ohmThe response is quite odd in that it doesnt slope down Dont know if that is intentional accidental or due to power supply caps aging letting in more ripple as power goes upRegardless lots of power is availableCompany only specs the power into 8 ohm at 130 watts It certainly delivers thatPutting aside noise floor which is rather high the units transfer function is one of the best I have ever seenSadly there is a significant power on popConclusionsAs one of my favorite  brands I was very anxious to measure a Rotel amp hoping it would not let me down Fortunately it did not No the SINAD doesnt break new ground but the rest of the measurements are very good with plenty of power available It is a great choice for people wanting good amount of power in an attractive package with competent performanceI am going to recommend  Rotel RB1070 As always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
