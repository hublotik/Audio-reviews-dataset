0,All measurements presented here are for balanced operation Following its 13power onehour preconditioning test the Electrocompaniet Nemos chassis was quite warm to the touch but not uncomfortably so The amps input impedance measured 301k ohms  The output voltage was rendered slightly unstable by infrasonic noise—not enough to be of concern during normal operation but enough to render such high inputimpedance measurements less than fully reliable I can say however that the Nemo has a far higher input impedance than do most solidstate power amplifiersThe output impedance measured higher than specified at between 017 and 023 ohms depending on frequency and the load impedance used to derive the measurement These are moderately high values for a solidstate amplifier—enough to cause into real loudspeaker loads a small frequencyresponse deviation that might be marginally audibleThe Nemo is noninverting when driven balanced with pin 2 positive or via the unbalanced adaptor DC offset measured 04mV The Electrocompaniets voltage gain into 8 ohms measured a high 343dB The signalnoise ratio  measured 896dB over a 22Hz–22kHz bandwidth 802dB from 10Hz to 50kHz and 933dB AweightedFig1 shows the Nemos frequency response with a 025dB error visible into our simulated speaker load The 10kHz squarewave response  exhibits a good risetime with a slight rounding of the leading edge—very common among even the best amplifiers—and no overshoot or ringing  The THDnoise percentage vs frequency curves are plotted in fig3 The results show increasing levels of distortion at lower load impedances and higher frequencies but the distortion overall remains quite low The distortion increases slightly when the amplifier is driven unbalanced  but remains insignificant at these low power levelsFig1 Electrocompaniet Nemo frequency response at  2W into 4 ohms 1W into 8 ohms and 2828V into simulated loudspeaker load Fig2 Lexicon MC1 ADC frequency response at 1V input Fig3 Electrocompaniet Nemo THDnoise  vs frequency at  4W into 2 ohms 2W into 4 ohms 283V into simulated loudspeaker load and 1W into 8 ohms Fig4 shows the waveform of the Nemos distortion at 2W into 4 ohms thirdharmonic distortion clearly predominates The distortion waveforms are very similar at 1W into 8 and 2 ohms  Because of the Nemos very high power output and the limitations of our test load I looked at the 50Hz spectrum of 400W into 8 ohms instead of the usual 4 ohms  All artifacts are below –80dB  with again the thirdharmonic highest in levelFig4 Electrocompaniet Nemo 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig5 Electrocompaniet Nemo spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 400W into 4 ohms Fig6 shows the Nemos response at 376W into 8 ohms to a combined 1920kHz signal—the intermodulation products resulting from an input signal consisting of an equal combination of these two frequencies  Again the resulting IM distortion is below –80dB  everywhere except at 18kHz  where it is a stilllow –74dB Fig6 Electrocompaniet Nemo HF intermodulation spectrum DC–22kHz 1920kHz at 376W into 4 ohms It was during the HF intermodulation measurement that a brief overload from a toohigh input shut down the Nemo I lowered the input level and the amp returned to normal operation However there was the distinct smell of a burnt part possibly a resistor The smell dissipated and the amplifier continued to operate normally with consistently good measurements When I then retested the Nemo its frequency response was unchanged but its THDnoise readings seemed a bit unstable giving different results at different times but always remaining well below 01 The Nemos 1kHz THDnoise percentage vs output power curves are shown in fig7 The amplifiers high power output is obvious Again because of the Nemos high power and the limited capability of our test load I took no readings into 2 ohms The only oddity in these curves is the rise in distortion at lower power  The discrete clipping measurements  indicated a power output of 757W  into 8 ohms and 1145W  into 4 ohms Fig7 Electrocompaniet Nemo distortion  vs continuous output power into  8 ohms and 4 ohmsThis is an excellent set of measurements for a very highpowered amplifier—Thomas J Norton
