0, Peachtree amp500 stereo amplifier   costs US 1499The amp500 comes in the same packaging of many previous Peachtree products I wish company would innovate here as the design looks kind of dated Then again it is very unique This amplifier comes with balanced inputs which I very much likeWhen I pushed the amp the protection circuit naturally kicked it but unlike many other amps recovered automatically without the need for a power cycleThe back half of the box is empty so the amp module is small And there is plenty of ventilation on top There was only modest temperature rise in the case post all the testing I did which is admirablePeachtree amp500 MeasurementsThe amplifier was ready on power upDashboard measurement shows above average performanceNoisedistortion as embodied in SINAD is well above median although well sort of state of the artI could not come close to matching company spec for SNRFrequency response was flat enough and not dependent on impedance which is very good for a class D ampCrosstalk was state of the art so I am assuming some kind of dual mono configurationMultitone was respectableLets see how power it pumps into a 500 watt loadThat is a lot of power The clipping is quite sharp though which when combined with the protection circuit would not allow me to measure max power But I did get peak powerI think spec is 700 watts but we are close enough Even at 8 ohm we have good bit of powerHigh frequencies bother the amp but go lower and linearity is excellentFinally we have a new test power on noiseI havent run this test on other amps to know if this is good or bad Once I do get some mileage on it we will better know what is going on If I were to guess I would say this is good performanceConclusionsStory here is simple tons and tons of power with above average noise and distortion A cool running switching amplifier in small package as well Really nothing much to complain about hereI am going to recommend the Peachtree amp500
