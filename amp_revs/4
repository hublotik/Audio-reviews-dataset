0,The NAD C 298 can be operated as a conventional stereo amplifier or as a bridgedmono amplifier  As Kal Rubinson auditioned the NAD both in stereo mode and as a pair of monoblocks I performed a complete set of measurements in both modes The C 298 has an output stage operating in classD so I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter between the test load and my  system  This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slewrate limiting and I used it for all the tests other than frequency responseThe C 298 has both balanced and singleended inputs I performed most of the measurements using the balanced inputs repeating some tests with the unbalanced inputs With the amplifier in stereo and fixedgain modes I measured a voltage gain of 286dB into 8 ohms with both types of inputs With the amplifier switched to variablegain mode the voltage gain could be varied between 935dB and 285dB In mono mode the C 298s gain into 8 ohms was 253dB in fixedgain mode but could be varied between 154dB and 3455dB in the variablegain mode The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with both types of inputs in both stereo and mono modes as well as from the preamplifier output The XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 hotThe input impedance is specified as a high 56k ohms with both types of input My measurement was close to the specification for the singleended inputs at 49k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz This dropped inconsequentially to 35k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was 100k ohms at 1kHz and a little lower at the frequency extremes The gain at the preamplifier outputs was –01dB sourced from an impedance of 655 ohms at 20Hz and 385 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHzWith the NAD amplifier in stereo mode I measured a very low output impedance of 006 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 0072 ohms at 20kHz  The output impedance was only slightly higher in mono mode at 0063 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 0082 ohms at 20kHz The modulation of the NADs frequency response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore very low at ±005dB  This graph was taken in stereo mode the responses were identical in mono mode The smallsignal bandwidth was restricted by the lowpass filter between the amplifiers classD stage and its output terminals Into 8 ohms  the ultrasonic rolloff reached –3dB at 66kHz This rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  There is a critically damped overshoot on the tops and bottoms of the waveform but there is no ringingFig1 NAD C 298 stereo mode frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  Fig2 NAD C 298 stereo mode smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation in stereo mode was superb at 110dB in both directions below 1kHz and still close to 80dB at 20kHz Without the auxiliary lowpass filter 180mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the C 298s output terminals With the AP filter and the C 298 set to stereo mode and fixed gain the unweighted wideband signal noise ratio taken with the singleended inputs shorted to ground was 785dB  ref 1W into 8 ohms It improved to 951dB when I restricted the measurement to the audioband and to 99dB with an Aweighting filter in circuitThese ratios were affected only slightly by switching the amplifier in stereo mode to variablegain mode and adjusting the gain from minimum to maximum This can be seen in fig3 which shows the spectrum of the lowfrequency noise floor with the gain set to its minimum  and to its maximum  The only power supply–related component visible in this graph is at 60Hz but this is negligible at almost –120dB ref 1W into 8 ohms With the C 298 set to bridged mono and with the variable gain set to its minimum the noise floor was identical to what it had been in stereo mode other than no longer having a 60Hz component  However increasing the gain to its maximum now raised the noise floor by around 10dB Fig3

ohms with maximum variable gain  and fixed gain  The C 298s rated power in stereo mode is specified as 185Wpc into 8 ohms  and 340W into 4 ohms  The NAD exceeded its specified power into both impedances With both channels driven and clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1 the C 298 clipped at 275W into 8 ohms  and at 510W into 4 ohms  What is extraordinary about these two graphs is that the harmonic distortion reaches 00005 or lower at powers between 20W and 180W into 8 ohms and between 40W and 70W into 4 ohms  The C 298 is one of the lowestdistortion amplifiers I have measured rivaling the less powerful Benchmark AHB2 that KR reviewed in November 2015Fig5 NAD C 298 stereo mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 NAD C 298 stereo mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsIn bridgedmono mode the NADs rated power is specified as 620W into 8 ohms  Again the C 298 exceeded its specified power clipping at 980W into 8 ohms  NAD doesnt recommend using the amplifier in mono mode to drive impedances below 8 ohms Nevertheless I measured a clipping power of 880W into 4 ohms Fig7 NAD C 298 mono mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsI examined how the THDN percentage in the C 298s output in stereo mode varied with frequency at 14V  I tried a higher output level—20V—but the amplifier went into protection mode after a short while driving the higher frequencies at 2 ohms The distortion into 8 ohms was very low  though it started to rise in the top octave The distortion hardly rose into 4 ohms  and only by a little into 2 ohms Fig8 NAD C 298 stereo mode THDN  vs frequency at 14V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The NAD amplifiers distortion signature at high power in both stereo and mono modes into 4 ohms was primarily third harmonic   Spectral analysis confirmed that this harmonic was slightly higher in level in the right channel  than the left  though at –124dB ref 100W into 8 ohms  it is negligible Note the commendable absence of higherorder harmonics in this graph At the same output voltage into 4 ohms which is equivalent to 200W the third harmonic rose to –110dB in the left channel and to a still very low –104dB in the right  In bridgedmono mode at 100W into 8 ohms the second and third harmonics both lay at –120dB  though the third harmonic rose to –100dB  at the same voltage into 4 ohms Fig9 NAD C 298 stereo mode left channel 1kHz waveform at 200W into 4 ohms 00031 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 NAD C 298 stereo mode

in stereo mode was extremely low  Surprisingly the higherorder products were even lower in mono mode at 00W into 8 ohms though the difference product at 1kHz still lay below –120dB Fig14 NAD C 298

days when NADs amplifiers were designed by the late Björn Erik Edvardsen I have always been impressed by the companys conservative and competent engineering The NAD C 298 continues that tradition but with its Eigentakt classD output modules sets a new standard for combining very high power with supremely low distortion Footnote 1 This impressively high power could not however be sustained for more than 30 seconds or so The owners manual says that running the C 298 in bridgedmono mode to drive impedances lower than 8 ohms may cause the amplifiers thermal cutout to operate if played at high levels Very likely a bridged NAD 298 would perform well into loads less than 8 ohms at normal listening levels—and it would then have impressive shortterm reserves to draw on for transient power Indeed while NAD does not recommend bridged C 298 for use with loads below 8 ohms it specifies the bridged amp as having an impressive 1100W of IHF dynamic power into 4 ohms when bridgedWhats going on In effect bridging an amplifier cuts the impedance the amplifier sees in half so while the amp has more power it needs more power to drive a more difficult load The same phenomenon is at work in all bridged amplifiers—Editor
