This review abbreviated measurements Linn Majik DS1 integrated streamer amplification It discontinued back 2010 announced US 4200 I see recent ebay sale bit 1000The Linn attractive unitThe interesting bits backYou full suite analog digital inputs although given age USB input lacking Roon remote built networking nice older device And course full amplification single box solutionStreamer DAC Stereo MeasurementsSince line lets use Toslink input DAC measure comes power amplifierBy todays standard definitely subpar sum distortion noise relative signal close enough beat CD formatI tested streaming Roon player performance identical goodAmplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started testing power amplifier using Toslink optical input firstWe see sum total SINAD 78 dB This obviously NOT limited DAC produced 20 dB better performance Indeed switching analog input see confirmedAs DS1 lies smack middle rankings amplifiers tested regardless price I quickly ran frequency response test using analog input quite surprised flatThinking may digitized I switched digital input 441 kHz 96 kHz samplingWe see curve So unless kind EQ I dont know sad see roll offLets measure power 4 ohmThis little power secondary use It naturally drops lower 8 ohm loadAnd good watts either given early distortion takes flattens curve swings clippingConclusionsIn 2010 kind functionality would advanced But today range streaming solutions amps retail hundreds dollars much power It disappointing see engineering focused company like Linn target low power noise distortionAnyway even 1000 I cant recommend Linn Majik DS1 That said one using secondary location like bedroom office etc would fine
