0,When I received the sample of the Moonriver 404 Reference that Jason Victor Serinus had auditioned serial number DK201002153RE it rattled when I unpacked it I removed the top cover and saw that the amplifier had incurred damage during its transcontinental journey The heavy toroidal power transformer is mounted on one side of the large printed circuit board that occupies almost all the amplifiers internal space with two aluminum straps connecting the board to the central internal heatsink to provide the necessary support The box must have been dropped on its top during the journey as the two aluminum straps had fractured with one loose inside the chassis When I connected the amplifier to my  system  the left channel was dead though I was able to perform a complete set of tests on the right channel using the linelevel inputsI let Editor Jim Austin and Moonrivers US distributor Philip OHanlon of On a Higher Note know about the situation OHanlon told me that there would be a running change in production to provide more support for the transformer and he arranged for Moonriver to ship a second sample to me directly from SwedenThis sample serial number DK201120164RE arrived without shipping damage and I resumed testing Although the internal heatsink doesnt look substantial it is connected to the bottom panel with thermally conductive grease so that the entire chassis can dissipate heat  amplifier by following the IHFs recommendation of operating it at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time the temperature of the chassis was 1001°F  The 404 Reference has sufficient heatsink capacity for its rated powerI looked first at the new samples behavior via its line inputs The maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 46dB which is a little higher than usual for an integrated amplifier At the preamplifier output the maximum gain measured 16dB The 404 Reference preserved absolute polarity  at both its loudspeaker and preamplifier outputsThe 404 References line input impedance was an appropriately high 24k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to a sufficiently high 171k ohms at 20kHz The manual says that the preamplifier output impedance is a few ohms I measured 96 ohms at high and middle frequencies and a higher 1426 ohms at the bottom of the audioband However I had problems measuring the behavior of the 404 References preamplifier output due to the presence of high levels of ultrasonic noise  I believe this noise which had a center frequency around 17MHz was confusing the input of the  This noise was present with both samples of the amplifier and could be the cause of a buzz Jason Serinus told me he experienced with the preamplifier outputThe amplifiers output impedance was moderately low at 023 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 033 ohms at 20kHz The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore small at ±025dB  This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum and the right channel output  was 025dB higher than the left  The channel balance improved at lower settings of the volume control in the range at which it will most often be used The amplifier rolls off slightly at the top of the audioband the response reaching –04dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 50kHz This results in a slight lengthening of the waveforms leading edges with the Moonrivers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  The waveform is free from overshoot and ringing howeverFig1

the line inputs  was okay at 72dB in both directions below 2kHz decreasing to 48dB L–R and 56dB R–L at 20kHz The level of the Moonrivers noise floor dropped at lower settings of the volume control but even with the control at its maximum which is the setting I use for noisefloor analysis supplyrelated spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics remained at or below –90dB ref 1W into 8 ohms  The higherorder supply harmonics were around 10dB lower in level in the right channel  than the left  The wideband unweighted SN ratio taken with the input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was 547dB left and 499dB right ref 283V output into 8 ohms Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audible range improved the ratios to 753dB and 748dB respectively while switching an Aweighting

distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Moonriver 404 Reference distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI measured how the 404 References distortion changed with frequency at 1267V output which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms and 40W into 4 ohms The THDN percentage was low in the midrange and bass into both loads  but rose in the top audio octaves more in the right channel  than the left  The distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  with the third and higher harmonics lower in level even into 4 ohms  Even with the rise in

ohms The first sample included the optional USB digital module I didnt test this however as it uses an AKM DAC chip that is no longer available due to a disastrous fire at the Japanese factory in late October 2020  The digital module wasnt installed in the second sample of the amplifier The 404 References phono input offers moving magnet and moving coil modes these selectable with internal DIP switches however the second sample of the 404 Reference had not been fitted with the phono module This input behaved identically to the line inputsThe Moonriver 404 References measured performance had some good points the low level of powersupply spuriae and the distortion signature which is primarily the subjectively benign second harmonic without this being accompanied by excessive levels of intermodulation distortion However the amplifier does not meet its specified powers I was also bothered by the high level of ultrasonic noise from the preamplifier outputs Footnote 1 The level of this noise was not reduced when I floated the Audio Precisions signal generator ground nor when I connected the grounding terminal on the amplifiers rear panel to the analyzer ground
