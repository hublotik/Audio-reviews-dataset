0, Marantz Model 40n  For the digitalinput measurements I used TosLink data and the HEOS app on my iPhone to play back testtone WAV files on a USB stick plugged into the rearpanel portThe Marantzs singleended line inputs preserved absolute polarity at both the loudspeaker and headphone outputs The volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps and the maximum gain was 406dB at the loudspeaker outputs and 407dB at the headphone output The power amplifier stage offered a fixed gain of 24dB The input impedance at both the line inputs and the power amplifier inputs was 15k ohms at all audio frequenciesThe Model 40ns output impedance at the headphone output was a relatively high 320 ohms The loudspeaker output impedance including the series impedance of 6 of spacedpair cable was 01 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing slightly to 012 ohm at 20kHz The smallsignal bandwidth was extremely wide the response into 8 ohms  down less than 3dB at 200kHz Into 2 ohms  the output was –3dB at 100kHz Frequencyresponse variations into our simulated loudspeaker load  were negligible This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum  the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control The extended ultrasonic response meant that the Marantzs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured very short risetimes  Commendably no overshoot or ringing was visible The bass and treble controls offered a maximum boost and cut of close to 10dB Fig1 Marantz Model 40n volume control set to 100 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Marantz Model 40n smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 Marantz Model 40n frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls turned off and set to maximum and minimum Channel separation was excellent at 90dB in both directions below 3kHz and still close to 80dB at 20kHz With the line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the Model 40ns unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was a good 717dB ref 283V into 8 ohms  This ratio improved to 82dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 847dB when Aweighted While spuriae at the supply frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics were present in the amplifiers output  their levels were all very low even with the volume control set to its maximumFig4 Marantz Model 40n spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms volume control set to 100 Marantz specifies the Model 40ns maximum power as 70Wpc into 8 ohms  and 100Wpc into 4 ohms  We specify clipping power as when the THDnoise reaches 1 By that measure and with both channels driven the Marantz amplifier exceeded its specified powers clipping at 74Wpc into 8 ohms  and 120Wpc into 4 ohms  I didnt test clipping power into 2 ohms as the amplifier isnt specified into that load Fig5 Marantz Model 40n distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Marantz Model 40n distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe distortion lies below the noisefloor at powers below a few tens of watts so I examined how the THDN varied with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms  The distortion is very similar into both 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  and while there is a slight increase in the top two audio octaves the distortion is extremely lowFig7 Marantz Model 40n THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion waveform at this output voltage was dominated by random noise even when I averaged 32 readings  Spectral analysis  indicated that the second harmonic was the highest in level into 8 ohms but at –103dB  this is negligible At the same voltage into 4 ohms  the third harmonic was now the highest in level but at close to –100dB  is still negligible Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W peak into 4 ohms the intermodulation distortion products all lay at or below –90dB Fig8 Marantz

40ns digitalinput performance the optical and coaxial SPDIF inputs locked to data sampled at up to 192kHz The Marantzs digital inputs all preserved absolute polarity With the volume control set to its maximum a 1kHz digital signal at –40dBFS resulted in a level at both the loudspeaker and headphone outputs of 22V This implies that the DA circuit has close to 20dB of excess gain Data at 0dBFS would drive the amplifier into clipping unless the volume control was set to –20dB  I used this volume control setting for the digital input measurements and to avoid damaging the power amplifier stage with highlevel digital data digital inputs behavior at the headphone output which mutes the loudspeaker outputsThe Marantz amplifier offers a choice of two reconstruction filters referred to as F1 and F2 F1s impulse response with 441kHz data  is typical of a very short linearphase filter with just one cycle of ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS F2s impulse response  has ringing on both sides of the single high sample but with considerably more ringing after than before This impulse response is identical to the hybrid filter offered by ESS DAC chips  With 441kHzsampled white noise  the F1 filters response rolled off slowly above 20kHz not reaching full stopband suppression until 37kHz well above half the sample rate  The aliased image at 25kHz of a 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  is suppressed by just 12dB therefore but the distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are all very low in level Repeating this analysis with the F2 filter  the ultrasonic rolloff was much faster resulting in considerably greater suppression of the aliased image at 25kHz However there is an odd boost in the noisefloor above 65kHzFig12 Marantz Model 40n TosLink input F1 filter impulse response Fig13 Marantz Model 40n TosLink input F2 filter impulse response Fig14 Marantz Model 40n TosLink input F1 filter wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled

digitalinput frequency response rolled off gently above 12kHz reaching –3dB at 20kHz The levels of the two channels were perfectly matched With 96kHz  and 192kHz  data the audioband output was flat with then a gentle rolloff starting below half of each sample rate With the F2 filter  the audioband response was flat with then a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rateFig16 Marantz Model

output with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16 and 24bit data  The noisefloor dropped by 15dB with 24bit data which implies that the Marantz offers between 18 and 19 bits of resolution However this graph was taken with the volume control set to –20dB  ultimate resolution I repeated the 24bit analysis with the volume control set to its maximum The noisefloor dropped by another 6dB but the improved resolution will be academic given the digital inputs gain architecture The waveform of a tone at exactly –9031dBFS with undithered 16bit data was reproduced with the three DC voltage levels described by the data unobscured by noise  With undithered 24bit data  the result was a relatively clean sinewaveFig18 Marantz Model 40n TosLink input volume control set to –20dB spectrum with noise

via the Marantz amplifiers digital inputs with F1 active  was very low in both channels While the ultrasonic aliased images of the tones are suppressed by just 10–12dB the higherorder audioband images all lie close to –120dB With F2 the difference product at 1kHz lay at just –114dB Fig20 Marantz Model 40n TosLink input Filter 1 volume control set to –20dB HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz

Model 40n for its rejection of wordclock jitter via its TosLink input using 16 and 24bit JTest data sampled at 441kHz Other than those closest to the frequency of the tone at onequarter the sample rate the oddorder harmonics of the 16bit JTest signals LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were all close to the correct levels  However some broadening of the noisefloor around Fs4 spectral component can be seen most likely due to jitter with a lowfrequency random noise spectrum This broadening was also evident with 24bit JTest noisefloor data Fig22 Marantz Model 40n TosLink input volume control

±35kHzTo look at the Marantzs moving magnet phono input I connected a separate ground wire from the terminal on the amplifiers chassis to the ground of the Audio Precision analyzer phono inputs behavior primarily at the headphone output again to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stages with highlevel signalsThe phono input preserved absolute polarity The maximum gain with the volume control set to its maximum was 848dB at both the headphone output and loudspeaker outputs so the gain of the phono section is 442dB This gain value means that clipping is possible with highlevel LP signals owners should make sure the volume control isnt set near the maximum when using the phono input I performed most of the phonoinput tests with the control set to –20dB The M40ns phono input impedance was 39k ohms at 20Hz 46k ohms at 1kHz and 40k ohms at 20kHz values appropriate for moving magnet cartridges The RIAA correction  was wellmatched between the channels but featured a broad rise in the midrange that reached 045dB at 150Hz The phono inputs unweighted wideband SN ratio measured with the input shorted to ground was a very good 697dB  referred to an input signal of 1kHz at 5mV Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased the ratio to an excellent 83dB while switching an Aweighting filter into circuit further increased the ratio to 877dBFig23 Marantz Model 40n phono input response with RIAA correction  and with subsonic filter  The Marantz phono inputs overload margins were commendably high from 20Hz to 20kHz at 244dB ref 1kHz at 5mV The phono stages distortion was very low with all the second and third harmonics lying close to –100dB  even with a 1kHz tone 16dB higher than the nominal MM output level of 5mV Highorder intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak input level equivalent to 1kHz at 30mV lay below –100dB  with the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lying at –94dB Fig24 Marantz Model 40n MM phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz for 30mV input The Marantz Model 40n offers uniformly excellent measured performance from all its inputs But I remain puzzled why its digital inputs in common with almost all integrated amplifiers I have tested offer considerably higher gain than necessary Footnote 1 See for example fig1 here
