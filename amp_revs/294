0, Starke Sound AD4320 four channel amplifier It was kindly purchased by a member new and drop shipped to me It costs US 1499 but they have had sales with prices as low as US 900The Ad4320 looks a bit industrial and is quite heavy for a class D amplifierThe reason for heavy weight is dual linear transformers and power supply on the right side Usually class D amplifiers use switching power supplies which keeps the unit light My own switching amplifier also uses a linear power supply with its weight and size penaltyI was pleased to see balanced inputs and triggers for remote on and offAs you can see you can bridge two channels together and get double the power Unlike other amps that require funky connections you have two dedicated terminals with a slide switch to select the mode  When I powered on the unit I could not get output out of one channel I switched the bridge mode left and right  and it got both working For bulk of my testing I tested channels 1 and 2Starke Sound AD4320 MeasurementsWe start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a load of 4 ohm with power of 5 wattsGain is atypically low at 21 dB  Not a problem with our dedicated DACs as they can easily provide the voltage the unit needs Sadly we have high 2nd and 3rd harmonics that cause SINAD to droop down to 73 dB This is well below average of all amplifiers testedWe are talking chipamp performance level here not anything that would come at this price rangeSignal to noise ratio is better but not excitingMultitone test shows rapid rise in distortion with frequencyThe class D amplifier filter is not inside the feedback loop so shows high sensitivity to loadThis means the tonality you get may depend on the actual impedance of the speaker you use Crosstalk between channels 1 and 2 is very goodKey performance metric for any amplifier is powered and I was very surprised to see far less power than specifiedWe are not even in the same planet with 104 watts vs spec of 320 I switched channel 2 to 3 just in case there is a power supply limit but it almost made no difference We are still way short of the company specsStory repeated with 8 ohm loadForgetting about lack of power we also have very early rise in distortion and rising before clippingI thought maybe they had used peak power to rate the amplifier but that is not in the same vicinity eitherWe do see the benefit of the linear amplifier in the way it allows higher burst power than tightly regulated switching power suppliesSweeping the frequency and measuring power and THDN shows smooth lines which is good but they are quite elevated at higher frequenciesConclusionsThe AD4320 underperforms in so many categories You can argue about audibility of this and that measurements but not the lack of power That you will hear Is the unit broken Could be but it doesnt perform like it is broken I thought maybe it is set to 240 volts but it is clearly marked as being a 120 volt unit  And at any rate if they shipped the amp this way to a US customer then that is what they are going to getI cant recommend the Starke Audio AD4320 Getting four channels with so much power would have been a good value if they had delivered But when they dont there is no reason to buy it
