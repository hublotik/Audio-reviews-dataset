0, Luxman SQN150 hybrid integrated amplifier with phono stage   costs US 3295Can you say pretty I knew you could Love the elegant front panel with VU meter Nice set of balance and tone controls are provided as wellAs you can see power amplification is provided through ECC83 triode drivers going to EL84 power tubes Amplifier is conservatively designed and is rate at just 1010 watts into 6 ohms I like the look without the cage but here it is withNot much exciting in the back other than modern beefy speaker terminals than that of vintage tube amplifiersThe package is smaller than one imagines but weighs a hefty 27 pounds Notice the AC terminal doesnt have earth ground and unit is double insulated In testing I found no effect from earthing the unit or notFrontend and preamps are solid stateLuxman SQN150 Amplifier MeasurementsWhen I picked 5 watts as my standard for measuring amplifiers it was usually a fraction of the amplifier power but here it is nearly half the available power So relatively speaker distortion plays a much strong role than it would otherwiseThe high second and third harmonics set the stage as far as SINAD  but I wish there was not so much power supply noise Sadly the amplifier takes up the ranking of second worst amplifier I have ever measured as far as distortionnoiseThose power supply spikes set the lower bound for dynamic rangeIt is not too bad but you likely will use very sensitive speakers with this low power amplifier so the numbers may manifest themselves more than they usually doFrequency response is extended but shows a kink indicating some kind of filterCrosstalk does not follow the usual curve indicating some sort of resistive  element between the two channelsNormally the issue is capacitive which causes the two reference lines you seeMultitone which is supposed to resemble music with its 32 tone shows strong level of grass Hard to make a case that you are hearing more detail when so much is masked at this power levelI dont have a 6 ohm load so used my usual 4 and 8 ohm loads for power testingEdit forgot to post the different frequency sweepsLuxman SQN150 Phono Stage MeasurementsThe amplifier noise and distortion dwarfs the phono stage so I only checked its frequency responseSo very good on this critical measurementLuxman SQN150 Headphone MeasurementsFor same reason as above I just made a power measurementSeems usable from power availability point of view but noise and distortion are quite high Company specifies 16 ohm output impedance and wisely recommends against using low impedance headphones for good reasonThe headphone amplifier is simply connected to the amplifier output using the aforementioned resistor which eats up all the power It will also change the frequency response of your headphone if it is not flat So best to be avoidedLuxman SQN150 Listening TestsMy lab speaker is an infinity R253 which has a sensitivity of 87 dB I connected it to the SQN150 and started to listen I had to immediately acknowledge the lack of power as the volume control not only maxed out but there was so much distortion as to cause crackling noise I backed off to moderate listening level and the sound was OK but I noticed boominess in the lows as if you have more room modes than you do To confirm I switched to Topping PA5 amplifier on my bench and boominess was gone Likely the harmonic distortion of the amplifier is hitting on more room modes causing extra bassboominess I can see if your speakerssetup lacks bass that you experience a bit more of itThe volume control had to be kept below 1200 oclock By 100 oclock distortion would start to set in and sound would start to get grungy and rough Past 200 oclock it would be rather obvious and beyond that unusable There was usable volume with me sitting 5 feet from the single speaker With two speakers you could double that but it is still not enough power for me with this speaker If an audio reviewer cant hear this level of distortion they should give up testing audio gear Sadly none of the reviews I read made a remark about the distortion It is the classic case of paying a lot more and getting a lot less fidelity and enjoymentConclusionsThe high level picture here is very clear wonderful looking and presumably well built amplifier The problem is using tube technology and producing so little power I see no advantage to it euphonically or otherwise But it is possible for some people the bass impact is a positive But at what cost So much spent with so little dynamic capability due to lack of powerNeedless to say I cant recommend the Luxman SQN150
