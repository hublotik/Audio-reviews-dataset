0, Topping LA90 Discrete balanced stereo amplifier  costs US 799The case is the same as the ICbased Topping LA90 which is fine with me given its high quality look and feel The power switch doubles as input selector once the unit is on Volume control can be bypassed using switch in the backAs before power is provided by a hefty 64 volt switching power supply rated at 4 amps  The amplifier as you see is all balanced with three inputs You have a selection of low and high gains  It can be bridged and nicely tolerates even 4 ohm loads in that mode Trigger is provided to enable one power switch to turn on a series of devicesNote that this is a traditional amplifier and not class D There is no remote so if you need that you have to use a DACpreamp with that capabilityTopping LA90 Discrete MeasurementsThere is a lot to measure here given the fact that we have dual gains and bridge mode Lets work our way through it starting with low gain in stereo modeIncredibly the LA90 Discrete matches the performance of its IC based unit landing on its perch on top of all other amplifiers ever testedSwitching to high gain costs you a few dBs but you are still ahead the competitionSo feel free to use this mode Noise performance continues to be superbFrequency response is flat of course and load independentCrosstalk is better than average amplifier but is a step down from the regular LA90Multitone showcases the superbly low distortion levelsLets see how we are doing in power department starting with 4 ohmsWe wind up good bit more power at 70 watts  while giving up nothing in spectacular noise and distortion department Allowing for more distortion gets us more power8 Ohm performance follows the same pathTests so far have been at 1 kHz  so lets vary that and see what happensIn a word wow The amplifier simply doesnt care what frequency you throw out it This is a quite a step ahead of normal LA90 which itself was state of the artPower on is silent but off may create a faint noise depending on your speaker sensitivityWarm up showed one channel struggling a bit but later I found the power connector not fully tight so maybe that was the causeRegardless it behaved correctly after a minuteTopping LA90 Discrete Bridged MeasurementsAs with normal LA90 bridge mode still provides superb performanceThe name of the game is power though so lets see what we get into 4 ohmNotice how we get more power but distortion is nowhere to be found until we clipWow This makes a great case for using a pair of these amps You get so much power out of each one rivalling much larger amplifiersReactive Load TestingThe LA90 has a very sharp clipping point This means that it goes from vanishingly low distortion to full clipping Combine this with aggressive protection circuit which shuts the unit off and you have the make up of a system that cant be measured in batch mode as my Powercube setup uses If I set the voltage for 8 ohm load then it causes the amp to shut down when driven at 4 ohm Good news is that the amplifier doesnt care about reactive loads Here are the results for 8 ohm for exampleCodeMaximum Output41120231213 AMMaximum Output Level ResultsSelected Load  Ch1   Ch2   8 Ohm 60 deg Capacitive  212  213  8 Ohm 30 deg Capacitive  211  212  8 Ohm 0 deg Resistive  210  210  8 Ohm 30 deg Inductive  202  203  8 Ohm 60 deg Inductive  209  210I could not get a similar output at 4 ohm due to limitation of the instrumentation as stated above But if I drove the parameters manually I could get it to tolerate reactive loads just as wellSelecting 2 ohm caused the protection circuit to kick in I didnt have time to mess with thatI spent nearly 2 hours trying to get this test done with the amplifier being pushed to clipping and shut down probably 50 to 100 times Even though the case got pretty warm the amp continued to function without complaining ConclusionsTraditionally in highend audio when a company says they are using discrete designs I get prepared for bad performance Topping once again proves that this is no barrier for their designers The discreate LA90 not only matches the exemplary performance of the IC based LA90 but betters it in power handling producing more power  Pushing noise and distortion down in our top tier performance is very hard but Topping has no problem maintaining its significant lead over even best of the best amplifiers Their skills and execution in this regard leaves me speechlessNeedless to say it is my absolute pleasure to add Topping LA90 Discrete to my recommended list Today is a happy day PS Power amplifiers are least reliable audio products  New designs sometimes need to prove themselves in this regard So if you are risk averse please dont be the first to purchase this amplifier
