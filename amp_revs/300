0, Vista Audio Spark II stereo integrated amplifier It was kindly sent to me by  costs US 389 from the company directThe Spark comes in a deep but otherwise small caseNice to have dual inputs and volume control  The rear of the amp is a bit unusual in placing the mains input between the connectorsWould have thought to put the IEC jack all the way to the left and speaker to the right Doesnt matter if the performance is good anywayIs this the first audio product we have tested from SerbiaVista Audio Spark MeasurementsI had to crank the volume all the way up to get close to my nominal 29 dB gain Boy that is a lot of power supply noise Playing with grounding reduced the spikes at 60 Hz a bit but did nothing to the harmonics which are caused by the internal power supply Even if that was low the distortion spikes are not As a result the amplifier rates quite low in our overall rankingSignal to noise ratio is better than what we saw in the dashboard indicating the noise floor rises with powerI was surprised to see a bass roll off in this day and age where just about every amplifier is dccoupledMultitone shows a messy response with the lows polluted by the power supply and highs due to inadequate feedbackCrosstalk is below averageThe amplifier is rated at only 20 watts but I was not able to get thatIt did better actually with 8 ohm load indicating current delivery is its issueBack to 4 ohm if you allow more distortion or buRst the input you do get a bit more powerFinally there is fair bit of variability when we sweep frequenciesConclusionsSometimes I really wonder what appeal such amplifiers have that attract buyers This amp has too little power to drive most speakers and has a lot of noise and distortion as well There must be some mystique about it that I dont understandNeedless to say I cant recommend the Vista Audio Spark II amplifier I hope the designer sees these measurements and at least works to sharply reduce the power supply noise as that cant be anything good no matter what school you are from
