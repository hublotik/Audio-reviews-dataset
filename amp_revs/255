0, IOTAVX SA3 integrated stereo amplifier with builtin DAC and subwoofer output It was kindly purchased by  drop shipped to me It costs Â£39900  on companys website Hard to find it on sale in US but found one ebay listing for 498SA3 nails the industry design with svelte chassis dot matrix display and judicious use of backlighting for the logo I left the plastic on the display as otherwise it looks nicer than it does in the picture A reassuring power button is the left and a nice feeling rotary control handles the volume If you press it it becomes an input selector Very nicely doneBack panel shows a lot of inputsThere is phono input which I did not test I did test both analog input and Toslink digital input Sadly there is no USB input There is bluetooth but no streaming support over networkLets get started by using the line in  input to the power amp and work our way out to the DAC sectionAmplifier Audio MeasurementsWith integrated amplifiers with volume controls I adjust that to produce roughly 29 dB of gain which is a THX standard That gives us this dashboardDistortion dominates with second harmonic telling the full story Wish channel 2 was as good as channel 1 but this is typical Averaging the two we get this kind of rankingSo above average among 89 amplifiers tested so far  But not state of the art by any stretchNoise performance is goodYou almost clear the CDs 16bit dynamic range at 96 dB at 5 watts outputTypical of class AB designs bandwidth is abundantShould the zombie apocalypse come you can hook up a few hundred yards of wire to the speaker wire and have yourself an AM transmitter power amp A microphone and simple modulator and you could be talking to people thousands of miles away at nightCrosstalk is surprisingly goodIf you look inside the chassis you realize why A toroidal transformer is in the middle with each amplifier nicely separated from each other by good 8 to 10 inchesPower output at 4 ohms falls a bit short of the specAnd I am not too happy about the constant rise in distortion from just 1 watt ending worse than one of our worse performing Audio Video Receiver It is a bit happier driving an 8 ohm loadThats not a lot of power though so best get an efficient speaker is 8 ohm is the language it speaksFortunately burst power is quite decent Changing the frequency of the test tone hardly bothers the SA3Other topologies such as Class D make a mess out of this measurementDAC Audio MeasurementsTaking advantage of the preamp output I fired off a few DAC tests to get an idea of how good that subsystem is starting with our digital dashboardOK this is a bit disappointing You want a SINAD here that is 10 dB better than the amp for it to be transparent Here it is actually a couple of dB worse then the amplifier which means the combo will drag down the performance of the amplifier someAs a DAC it falls in the failing  category of all DACs tested to dateNoise performance is decentIntermodulationnoise test is disappointingThe upper line in orange is a phone dongle The SA3 hugs that performs like it is related to it which it should not beJitter performance looks better than it is due to high noise floor potentially hiding other spurious tonesSo overall the DAC portion is barely a match for the amplifier If the amp gets the grade B the DAC gets a CConclusionsIt is nice to see a fresh take on the integrated stereo amplifier from IOTAVIX The SA3 looks attractive has good feature set including many inputs from digital to analog and takes up little space You can nicely put it under your monitor add a couple of speakers and be in businessYou dont get to brag its measured performance but what is there is not broken which is often an accomplishment in world of audio Performance is solid across the board with the DAC trailing a bit I would happily use it in a secondary systemOverall I am going to recommend the IOTAVIX SA2 amplifier
