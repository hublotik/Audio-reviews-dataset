0, Audio Research VSi60s measured performance with Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain I checked the bias of each output tube after letting the amplifier warm up for an hour and before I did any testing All the tubes had exactly 60mV of bias as specified and didnt need adjustment with the toppanel potentiometers which suggests good stabilityI had one mishap during the testing I was measuring the amplifiers clipping power from the 4 ohm output transformer tap into 16 ohms and just as the waveform squared there was a loud bang I immediately pulled out the AC lead and took the cover off The 100 ohm wirewound plate resistor for one of the left channels 6550 output tubes had exploded No fuses had blown The other channel was okay as was the same tubes 1 ohm cathode resistor Audio Research sent me a replacement tube and resistor which I installed  though not to the same standard of neat soldering typical of the Minnesota companys products The repaired left channel measured the same as the undamaged right channel and offered the same signalnoise ratio as it had before the accident I continued with the remaining tests the harmonic and intermodulation spectraThe VSi60 offered a maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms of 3265dB from the 8 ohm tap and 299dB from the 4 ohm tap Though these gains are lower than usual for an integrated amplifier in my opinion theyre optimal for CD sources The unitygain setting of the volume control was between the third and fourth green LEDs on the frontpanel thermometer display The VSi60 preserved absolute polarity  through all the inputs and from both output taps Its input impedance was usefully high at 51k ohms in the midrange and below decreasing slightly to 37k ohms at 20kHz The subwoofer output appeared to be fullrange meaning that it should be used with a subwoofer that has its own lowpass input filterAs expected for an amplifier using a single pair of 6550 tubes per channel the output impedance was moderately high in the bass and midrange at 25 ohms from the 8 ohm tap and 16 ohms from the 4 ohm tap The impedance rose at 20kHz to 3 and 216 ohms from the 8 and 4 ohm taps respectively This highish source impedance gave rise to ±14dB response variations from the 8 ohm tap into the magazines standard simulated loudspeaker  while the increase in source impedance at high frequencies resulted in a premature topoctave rolloff of –2dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  The responses from the 4 ohm tap were similar but with less variation in response due to different load impedances as expected Fig1 Audio Research VSi60 8 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms

the traces in fig1 you can see a slight knee at 50kHz This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum at lower settings of the volume control the knee became a little more pronounced  which implies the existence of some sort of parasitic resonance which in turn results in a couple of cycles of welldamped ringing on the tops and bottoms of a 10kHz squarewave  The 4 ohm tap was better behaved in this respect The amplifiers reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave was superbly square Fig3 Audio Research VSi60 4 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with volume control at 1200  and at its maximum  Fig4 Audio Research VSi60 8 ohm tap smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig5 Audio Research VSi60 8 ohm tap smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation  was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 2kHz and still 78dB at 20kHz The amplifiers noise floor assessed with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum was also fairly low in level The unweighted wideband SN ratio  was a good 733 and 748dB for both channels from the 8 and 4 ohm taps respectively The audioband ratios were 5 and 3dB better while Aweighting the measurement gave 89dB from the 8 ohm tap and 90dB from the 4 ohm tapPlotting the THDnoise percentage in the VSi60s output against power revealed that the distortion began to rise above the noise floor at levels above 1–2W from the 8 ohm tap  and at levels above 500mW–1W from the 4 ohm tap  The linear increase above those levels before actual waveform clipping suggests that the circuit uses a low amount of loop negative feedback  ARC specifies the VSi60s maximum power at 15 THD The amplifier exceeds that specification from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms with 53Wpc available  at 1 THD though only 44W  were available from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms at 1 THD The amplifier did meet its 50W specification  from the 4 ohm tap at 6 THD however the 06dB shortfall in power will be inconsequentialFig6 Audio Research VSi60 8 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  16 8 4 ohmsFig7 Audio Research VSi60 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  16 8 4 2 ohmsProvided the speaker load is equal to or greater than the nominal value of the VSi60s output transformer tap the distortion at a level equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms remains below 01 in the midrange and below  though with a rise in THD in the upper audio octaves The distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous loworder harmonics even at moderate power levels  However fig11 indicates that the amplifiers power supply is working hard with the fundamental and thirdorder harmonics of the 60Hz AC power frequency almost as high in level as the distortion harmonics particularly in the right channel  The 120Hz component lies at –96dB in this graph  suggesting that the circuit benefits from optimal groundingFig8 Audio Research VSi60 8 ohm tap THDN  vs frequency at 63V into 16 ohms  8 ohms

distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig11 Audio Research VSi60 4 ohm tap spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–10kHz at 10W into 8 ohms These oddorder powersupply harmonics led to sidebands to either side of the two signal components in the spectrum of the VSi60s output while it reproduced an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level close to visual clipping on the oscilloscope screen  As anticipated from the circuits decreasing linearity in the top audio octave the 1kHz difference tone in this graph is moderately high in level at –60dB  and reaches –50dB  at 19W peak from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  The higherorder intermodulation products are all lower in level howeverFig12 Audio Research VSi60 8 ohm tap HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 25W peak into 8 ohms To a large extent the Audio Research VSi60s measurements are much as I would have expected from a tube amplifier using a single pair of 6550 output tubes per channel with low loop negative feedback and offering the sizes of power supply and output transformers that are possible at its price But its nicely engineered for all that Just make sure you use the appropriate output transformer tap for your loudspeakers
