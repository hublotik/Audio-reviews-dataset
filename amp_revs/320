0, Emotiva XPADR2 differential power amplifier   costs US 1699 from the company directThis thing a beast both in size and weightThis despite usage of switchmode power supply to keep the weight down Yeh right  My back is still complainingThere is no benefit to having a differential power amplifier but seems like they a pair of amps are used out of phase to double the power per channelThe switchmode power supply changes supply rail on  to keep power consumption low at lower power levels  In my testing the DR2 barely got warm so the mechanism is workingEmotiva XPADR2 MeasurementsI was expecting good measurements but instead got thisWow look at the harmonic spray starting at third one SINAD of 64 dB ranks almost at the bottom of nearly 150 amplifiers testedNot goodFortunately signal to noise ratio is excellent so this is a quiet amplifierFrequency response and crosstalk are fineMultitone test though shows the high distortion across the frequency bandThe main meal here is power into 4 and 8 ohm loads versus distortionnoiseThats incredible amount of power Alas it is delivered with lots of distortion Back to the power check out the max and peak powerAnd this is on a shared 20 amp 120 volt outlet I dont think we have measured any other amplifier that comes close to this level of outputSimilar story holds  for 8 ohmAs you see the curve looks nothing like other amplifiers where they are first noise limited until clipping sets in Here distortion is front and center even at 50 milliwattsWe get a look at the architecture of this amplifier by sweeping power at different frequenciesWe have a constant glitch around 20 to 50 watts which I am assuming is the amplifier switching rails to higher voltage We also have rising distortion as seen in the previous graphs even at low powerConclusionsAssuming I dont have to carry it much I love the build and great value as far as watt and maximum amount of power available SNR is also good so you should be free of speaker hiss Distortion is high though and there is no getting around it Will you hear it At 60 dB it is probably borderline for most peopleI cant recommend the Emotiva XPADR2 due to its high distortion Otherwise it is a very tempting package
