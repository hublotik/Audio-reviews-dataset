0, Audio Research Reference 150 using Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system   I installed a new set of tubes both the 6H30 smallsignal tubes and the four matched pairs of KT120 output tubes The instructions in the manual for setting the bias current for each pair were clear With zero input signal each main tube was set to a voltage drop of 65mV DC measured at its test points with the slave tube running between 57 and 73mV at its test points The only tricky part of this operation was that the test points were close to the tubes hot glass envelopes which resulted in occasional mild curses as I brushed a tube with my fingersThe Reference 150 has three outputtransformer taps marked 16 8 and 4 ohms and a common ground terminal The amplifier preserved absolute polarity from all three taps  with the input XLRs wired with pin 2 hot The voltage gain into 8 ohms was 265dB from the 16 ohm tap 239dB from the 8 ohm tap and 213dB from the 4 ohm tap The input impedance was very high at all frequencies at approximately the specified 300k ohms As expected the Ref150s output impedance varied according to the transformer tap selected The 16 ohm tap measured 14 ohms at low and middle frequencies rising to 19 ohms at the top of the audioband The figures for the 8 ohm tap were 1 and 14 ohms for the 4 ohm tap they were 055 and 087 ohm All three taps offer quite a low source impedance for a transformercoupled design as a result the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms Law action between that impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was relatively mild From the 8 ohm tap  it was ±08dB the 4 ohm tap offered ±04dB the 16 ohm tap ±1dB Fig1 indicates that the Ref150 has a wide bandwidth particularly into loads higher than the nominal tap value which correlates with a welldefined 10kHz squarewave  While this graph reveals a small but critically damped overshoot on the leading edges of the waveform presumably due to an ultrasonic transformer resonance no ringing is visible Channel separation  was superb at 100dB at 1kHzFig1 Audio Research Reference 150 8 ohm tap frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Audio Research Reference 150 8 ohm tap smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Ref150 was fairly quiet though the left channel was noisier than the right The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratios ref 283V into 8 ohms and taken from the 8 ohm output with the input shorted were 701dB left and 821dB right When Aweighted these figures improved to 885 and 992dB respectively Fig3 shows a spectral analysis of the amplifiers lowfrequency noise floor taken while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms from the 4 ohm tap The left channel has a higher level than the right of ACsupply–related spuriae primarily at 60 120 180 and 300Hz which is presumably why its SN ratios were not as good What really puzzled me in this graph was the appearance in both channels of a spectral component at 100Hz which is related neither to the signal frequency nor to the AC line frequency  I checked and doublechecked this measurement with no change in the resultFig3 Audio Research Reference 150 4 ohm tap spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms All taps behaved similarly when it came to the maximum output power Into a load twice the nominal tap value the Ref150 clipped  at 90W  Into the nominal tap value it clipped at the specified 150W  but with a higher level of distortion Into half the tap value the amplifier clipped at 80W  but with even higher distortion at lower powers It is important therefore to use the transformer tap that best matches your preferred loudspeakerFig4 Audio Research Reference 150 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Audio Research Reference 150 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Audio Research Reference 150 4 ohm tap distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsFig7 plots the THDnoise percentage from the 4 ohm tap into loads ranging from 2 to 16 ohms at a level 4V where the actual distortion rises above the noise floor The THD increases at low frequencies due to the onset of saturation in the output transformer and in the top octave due to the decreasing openloop gain margin in this region reducing the effectiveness of the negative feedback But over most of the audioband and when the load impedance is very much higher than the transformertap value the Ref150 offers low distortion The picture from the 8 and 16 ohm taps was similar  but with higher levels of distortion overallFig7 Audio Research Reference 150 4 ohm tap THDN  vs frequency at 4V into 16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms At low power the content of the distortion is predominantly secondharmonic in nature  the second harmonic being subjectively innocuous both because of its proximity to the fundamental tone and because adding a tone an octave higher than the fundamental is musically natural At higher powers and at low frequencies a regular series of harmonics appears  this connected with the Ref150s relatively small amount of overall negative feedback This and the circuits decreasing linearity at high frequencies means that the Audio Research amplifier does only moderately well on the demanding highfrequency intermodulation test  with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –54dB Fig8 Audio Research Reference 150 8 ohm tap 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  01 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Audio

A successful tubeamplifier design must walk a narrow path between competing aspects of performance Audio Researchs Reference 150 successfully treads that path with the caveat that it performs at its best with loudspeakers that have impedances equal to or higher than the nominal outputtap impedance
