Schiit Aegir stereo Power amplifier member patiently waiting since August review The Aegir sold direct Schiit costs US 799 plus shippingThe Aegir heavy substantial serious looking piece audio gear blackWhat I dont like extra sharp edges heatsinks side naturally want grab But I understand extruded aluminum comes way corners marchined would expensiveHere back panelAt first I super excited see XLR input became puzzled stereo amp one Then I realized driving unit bridged mode So testing I used RCA used XLR bridged power testingI cant quite tell type amplifier technical terms Schiit uses They seem want say mostly class A amplifier isnt higher power Anyway Aegir runs warm hot whatever trick using lower power consumption unit versus pure class A workingThe Aegir new design introduced 2018 I see Audio Precision measurements means part new design philosophy take measurements design verification seriouslyAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual start dashboard feeding 1 kHz tone amp aiming 5 watt output 4 ohmStarting left side gain 20 dB low side Then output power low dont need lot gain get maximum powerSINAD positive dB version THDN mathematically puts Aegir respectable average ranking power amplifiers testedWe see good bit power supply spikes I verified also exist Schiit AP measurements Levels 100 dB likely audible due poor sensitivity low frequenciesFrequency response ruler flat audible bandSignal noise ratio good matching need 16 bit audio playbackMultitone test tells us intermodulation 32 tones fed amplifierOnce see clear 16 bit threshold CD musicMost important test power versus THDN Lets see 8 ohmSchiit rates amp 20 watts 4 ohm close Likely allow 1 distortion versus standard onset clippingWhat puzzling 4 ohm outputWe long ways away 40 watts Then clipping tilts right I suppose walked curve far enough get 40 watts You would get good bit distortion though 40 watts marketing numberNote one channel unhappy I confirmed exists well Schiit measurements So likely power fed less efficiently one amp Or grounding component mismatch etcTo test bridged mode I fed Aegir vial XLR balanced connection got thisI get 23 watts usable power hardly 195 watts I got stereo mode The curve tilts right marketing department went town spec 80 watt number Measuring dynamic power uses 1 number Schiit uses get much powerSo real music likely power continuous tone tests indicateLets test sensitive Aegir input frequencySort classic output lower frequencies limit amount power available also lower distortion I asked add multitone test amplifier measurements I usually use DACs since lossless signal To use amplifiers signal converted PCM analog invokes DAC AP That would put limit good measurement I make For amps like Aegir limitation though isWe see general distortion floor around 100 bits 17 bits However earlier spikes due power supply noise Again hearing sensitive region ignoredConclusionsThe Schiit Aegir competently designed amplifier solid build quality design mistakes It shows power proper measurements engineering verification remove element surprise thirdparty verification job perform hereThe main issue lack power To someone like large spaces rather inefficient speakers desire bass feel much Aegir definitely Nor I buy Class A benefit If would show measurements It notIf efficient speakers andor dont listen loud Aegir solid offering western company I going put Schiit Aegir recommended list solid engineering design Fitness application
