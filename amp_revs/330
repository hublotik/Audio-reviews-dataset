0, Carver Raven 350 tube monoblock amplifier    costs US 4750The 350 is not a bad looking amp It has the same orange peel paint job of the previous Carver 275 amplifier I reviewed At 42 pounds the unit is pretty heavy With all the weight in the back the front handle is kind of useless when it comes to lifting itThere is an XLR input but I believe it is for convenience and performs the same as RCA  DC resistance of the 4 and 8 ohm terminals  and realized they are both the same Here I was switching back and forth between them  Anyway measured DC resistance is 047 ohm The 12 ohm tap has a lower DC resistance of about 03 ohmUnlike the 275 amplifier the fuses did not blow and the amp survived my sweep tests Bias is to be set at 80 on the front dial and that was the case when I powered on the unitThere is a gain control but you are advised to set it to max which is what I did for testingThere is a flip switch in the front which changes the amount of feedback  amp in both settingsHere are the specsCarver 350 MeasurementsLets start with highfeedback performance using XLR inputThere is copious amount of distortion causing SINAD to be dominated by it At 441 it ranks as the second worst amplifier ever testedIt even performed worse than the Carver 275 which had a SINAD of 46 Switching to lower feedback doesnt make things that much worseNote that gain is reduced and therefore volume will be different This makes AB testing tricky Here is a more detailed FFT showing the small difference between low and high feedbackNotice how distortion is made up of both 2nd and 3rd harmonics so you cant make the argument that it is 2nd harmonic goodnessAs noted RCA performance is the same as XLRPower supply 60 Hz noise in both cases causes severe intermodulation higher up in frequency No amount of grounding impacted that so it is endemic tot he designNoise performance is decent for type of amp it isIntermodulation distortion rears its ugly head again in multitone testI dont know how anyone could hear more detail with such an amp where so much of the music signal will get lost in the distortion grassFrequency response should be flat but it is notIt naturally will have load dependency due to output impedanceLets see the power situation as we had serious shortfall in the 275 ampWe dont meet the spec there but come closer with 8 ohmBack to 4 ohm here is our 1 THD  max and burst powerWe seem to get the same shortfall There is momentary reservoir though allowing the peak output to shoot way up This was not always consistent thoughI also tested 2 ohm capabilityYou are still current limited so no more powerChanging the test frequency gives us the following power curvesThere is some instability at 20 Hz and fairly significant power drop This points to power supply not having enough capacity as the lower frequency taxes it for longer period Some drop occurs in every amplifier by the way so it is a matter of how muchFinally the amplifier warms up quickly and is pretty stableTesting occurred after this warm upConclusionsWhat an upside down the world of audio is Folks want to pay so much more to get dirtier sound You want dirty The Carver 350 gives it to you Even at 5 watts there is copious amount of harmonic distortion Power supply mixes with that at such high level that it creates its own spread of distortion A video must come with these amps that hypnotizes you into thinking you are getting great soundI cant recommend the Carver 350 monoblock amplifier
