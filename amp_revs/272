0, 3e Audio SYDAP2002 stereo desktop DSP amplifier with Bluetooth   drop shipped to me I will also do a teardown and test with upgraded opamps I went to look up the price just now and it says no longer available I think it was US 116The enclosure is heftier than is typical for the classA cute set of white LEDs rotate around the volume control when first turned on and then indicate volume level  An unusual twist for this class of amplifier is inclusion of mains power supplyNo figure8 power cord was included however so I have to supply my own As you see there is a little fan to help with cooling but it never came on during my testing I had the top open and touching the heatsinks showed that they were pretty cool which explains the fan staying offNote that while there is a DSP subsystem I did not test it It is based on Sigma ADAU1701 platform which I already reviewed Amplification is provided using the ST Micro TPA3255 chipSYDAP2002 MeasurementsI started my testing using stock configurationDistortion is quite low at 95 dB however SINAD is way worse at just 72 dB indicating noise as the limiting factor  Dont be confused by the 100 dB noise floor in FFT That is after some 35 dB of FFT gain The owner had warned me about the noise and indeed had gone ahead and purchased the recommended upgrade opamps the LM 4562 I took the top off and swapped both and performance indeed improvedNoise still dominates though so performance continues to be averageYou can see the effect of noise in SNR testsHere is the comparison of noise with no input signal with or without the opamp upgradeFrequency response is limited based on digitization and load dependencyCrosstalk was generally good but somewhat variableMultitone test shows how low the distortion is alas with high noise floorHealthy amount of power is available before shut downBecause of aggressive protection circuit I could not get to 1 THD to measure max or peak powerGood bit of power is available at 8 ohm indicating that the 4 ohm performance above is current limitedTransfer function is quite good for a switching amplifierSYDAP2002 TeardownOverall construction seems reasonably cleanTop row is the switching power supply which naturally has highvoltage rectified mains in it As such I would have liked to see a routed slot in addition to existing isolation that exists on the PCB That would reduce the chances of arcing from high voltage side to the low voltage amplifierCapacitors are lower grade as usual but at least all the ones I looked at are higher grade 105 degree C The heatsink is quite beefy for its size and seemed to do its job keeping the TPA3255 chip amp cool in my testing I am not sure the fan will do any good since it likely pushes air in but there are no vents to push air out High static pressure then reduces its effectiveness although likely it is better than nothing I did not like the Bluetooth antenna lead travelling from the front of the board to the mains side The noise from switching power supply may reduce Bluetooth range and at any rate it is not a safe place for it should the lead come off and touch the highvoltage areas of the power supply The RCA cables could have been moved a bit up  and made room available for that in the low voltage sectionI see no regulatory and safety certifications which is not good in mains powered gearOverall this is not nearly as bad as it could be ConclusionsGetting a DSP platform and topflight chip amp and power supply in a small box takes good bit of effort Overall this is not a bad platform but compromises are there with performance dropping below what the chip amp can do Personally I use DSP upstream so have no use for it in the amp in this configuration so the performance hit  is not good in my book But you can decide otherwiseI could have recommended the amp but seeing how I had to upgrade the opamp to get good performance I am going to pass
