0, SMSL Q5 Pro DAC and stereo integrated amplifier The Q5 Pro costs US 140 from Amazon with Prime shippingThe sample sent to me is well usedIf you were a real audiophile you would think those scratches change the cabinet resonances leading to less black backgrounds micro detail and PRAT But since you are not lets read on Here is the back panelThe owner sent me two power supplies The other one outputs 24 volts but since it says on the back the limit is 19 I went with this one Heaven knows if I blew it up I could not buy another one and scratch it up the same way this one is Strangely if I squint the fuzzy picture on SMSL website shows the other power supplyAs you see you have both digital and analog inputs I tested both as you see belowAmplifier Audio MeasurementsLets start with analog input performanceWell that is not good One channel is producing far more distortion And noise level is quite high Switching to USB input improves the good channel significantlyThe bad channel is insisting on producing far more distortion Averaging the two we get a SINAD score that is pretty much at the bottom of our rankingsFrom here on I stuck with USB input since it performs better Frequency response was refreshingly goodPower into 4 ohm load shows poor responseDoesnt get much better into 8 ohmAnd we are way off the spec But that is typical Or maybe it needs the higher voltage power supplyThermal stabilityNot much was changing after power upConclusionsIt is one thing to have random performance when an amp is 50 or so But once you get to 140 I expect better than what SMSL Q5 Pro delivers If you want a little baby amp get the SMSL SA100 It behaves better and is much cheaper So no recommendation from me
