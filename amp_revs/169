0, Dan DAgostino M400 MxV amplifiers serial number 5879 with my  following the CEAs recommendation I ran it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the sidemounted heatsinks were hot at 1061°F  and the top panel was hotter at 1105°F  After testing the amplifier at high powers the temperature of the top panel had risen to 1204°F491°C The M400 MxV needs to be wellventilatedThe DAgostinos voltage gain was 269dB into 8 ohms and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  The specified input impedance is 1M ohm I measured 183k ohms at 20Hz 152k ohms at 1kHz and 129k ohms at 20kHz Though lower than the specified value these impedances are still usefully highFig1 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe DAgostinos output impedance was 05 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing slightly to 055 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was small at ±025dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was down by 3dB just above 100kHz though the increasing output impedance at very high frequencies means that the ultrasonic rolloff into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  was slightly greater The M400 MxVs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  was superb with no overshoot or ringingFig3 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms  and ay 100W into 8 ohms  Measured with the balanced input shorted to ground the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was a very good 793dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to 81dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 84dB when Aweighted While spuriae at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its harmonics were present in the M400 MxVs noisefloor  these are negligible at –90dB and below ref 1W into 8 ohms  As expected the levels of these spuriae ref 100W into 8 ohms  were as much as 20dB lowerFig4 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe Dan DAgostino M400 MxV is specified as offering maximum output powers of 400W into 8 ohms 800W into 4 ohms and 1600W into 2 ohms  With our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the M400 MxV clipped with a 1kHz signal at 442W into 8 ohms  and at 778W into 4 ohms  The AC wall voltage had dropped from 1197V with the amplifier idling to 1187V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms which is why the M400 MxV didnt quite meet its specified power into this load Similarly although I measured a clipping power of 1050W into 2 ohms the wall voltage had dropped to 116V at this powerFig6 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms I examined how the percentage of THDN changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The distortion was low into 8 ohms with a slight rise in the top of the audioband  but rose into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms Fig7 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0029 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig9 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 4 ohms The M400 MxVs distortion driving 1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms was predominantly the second harmonic  though higherorder harmonics are present at lower levels  The third harmonic rose almost to the same level as the second close to –70dB  at the same power into 4 ohms  and at 100W into 8 ohms Fig10 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms When the M400 MxV drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 50W into 8 ohms  both the secondorder difference product at 1kHz and the higherorder intermodulation products at 18kHz and 21kHz lay at –77dB  At the same voltage into 4 ohms these intermodulation products rose by 7dB but this is still a respectably low levelThe Dan DAgostino M400 MxV did well on the test bench offering very high power with sufficiently low levels of distortion and noise
