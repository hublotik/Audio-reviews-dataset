0, hefty Ovation MA82 monoblock    of a power amplifier I precondition it by running it at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes  After an hour driving 200W into 8 ohms the temperature of the MA82s heatsinks was a moderate 125°F  and its the top panel was warm at 1078°F  The frontpanel meter was accurately calibrated reporting as 1996W an actual level of 1988W into 8 ohmsThe voltage gain into 8 ohms for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs was 29dB and both inputs preserved absolute polarity the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance was slightly lower than the specified figures at 9k ohms unbalanced and 14k ohms balanced both values consistent from 20Hz to 20kHz The output impedance  was very low at 008 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising very slightly to 01 ohm at 20kHz As a result the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by just ±005dB  This graph taken with a balanced input  shows that the audioband response is flat into 8 ohms  with the ultrasonic rolloff reaching –05dB at a very high 100kHz The response rolled off earlier into lower impedances reaching –18dB at 100kHz into 2 ohms  but was still flat up to the top of the audioband The AVMs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was therefore excellent  with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringingFig1 AVM MA82 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 AVM MA82 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsWith those massive toroidal transformers close to the audio circuitry I was not surprised to find in the MA82s output some supplyrelated artifacts at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics  These will be due to magnetic interference but its fair to note that although theyre visible in this graph they all lie at or below –100dB ref 1W into 8 ohms The wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms taken with the input shorted to ground was okay at 746dB but this improved to 829dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 843dB when AweightedFig3 AVM MA82 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The AVM amplifier is rated to produce 600W into 8 ohms Fig4 shows that it didnt actually clip  until 805W  at which power output the AC wall voltage in my test lab measured 1211V The downward slope of the trace below 100W into 8 ohms in this graph indicates that the actual distortion lay below the noise floor at powers less than 100W Into 4 ohms  the MA82 clipped at 1320W  into 2 ohms it clipped at 1820W  even though at this power output the wall voltage had dropped to 1158VFig4 AVM MA82 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 AVM MA82 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI measured how the percentage of THDN varied with frequency at 283V output which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms 200W into 4 ohms and 400W into 2 ohms The results are shown in fig6 The distortion is very low overall but does rise into 4 and 2 ohms and in the top octaves and to my surprise below 50Hz The distortion is primarily the third harmonic  and even at a very high power into 4 ohms  doesnt rise above –90dB  However you can see in this graph the lowlevel supplyrelated spuriae which also appeared when I tested for intermodulation distortion  But note how low are the actual intermodulation products in fig9 despite the very high power The highorder products are all at or below –96dB  and the secondorder difference product at 1kHz cant be seen at all above the level of the lowfrequency supply spuriaeFig6 AVM MA82 THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 AVM MA82 1kHz waveform at 200W into 8 ohms 00013 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 AVM MA82 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–20kHz at 400W into 4 ohms Fig9 AVM MA82 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 400W peak into 8 ohms After having had some shall I say idiosyncratically engineered amplifiers pass through my test lab in recent months it was a pleasure to measure such a wellengineered conservatively specified amplifier as AVMs Ovation MA82
