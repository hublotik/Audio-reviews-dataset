0,Because in its flight case each Moon by Simaudio 888 amplifier weighs 300 lb I drove my  system  with its host PC monitor test loads and cables to Mikeys place rather than try to get one to my place and down the stairs from the front door to my basement test lab We manhandled one 888 onto a dolly and wheeled it into Mikeys garage where I set up my gear Because the outlets in his garage werent up to the amplifiers current demands we ran a long heavyduty extension cord to one of the 20A outlets in his houseUsually before performing any measurements I precondition an amplifier by running it for an hour at onethird its measured maximum power into 8 ohms—thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB output stage Time constraints—I needed to hit the road for the 45mile drive home before the Fridayevening rush hour—meant that I had to cut the preconditioning period to 20 minutes By the end of that time the Moon 888s top panel was barely warm at 784°F  the sidemounted heatsinks were hotter at 1096°F The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms using the balanced input was slightly higher than the specified 31dB at 32dB For the unbalanced input the gain was 29dB 3dB lower than the balanced gain rather than the expected 6dB The amplifier was noninverting  with both inputs Its balanced input impedance was 32k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to the specified 24k ohms at 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance was 16k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz but 10k ohms at 20kHzThe Moon 888s output impedance including 6 of speaker cable was very low at 003 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 0085 ohm at 20kHz The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore minimal  Into an 8 ohm resistive load  the Simaudios response was flat almost up to 20kHz then rolled off to reach –3dB at 70kHz rather than the specified 200kHz The response rolled off a little earlier into lower impedancesFig1 Moon 888 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  A rearpanel switch allows the amplifier to be operated with DC or AC input coupling The DC response was flat down to 10Hz  the AC response began to roll off in the low bass reaching –1dB around 15Hz  The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms was commendably free from overshoot and ringing Fig2 Moon 888 frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with DC selected  AC selected  Fig3 Moon 888 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Moon 888s unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground was 752dB This improved to an excellent 873dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 898dB when the measurement was Aweighted Spuriae were present in the amplifiers noise floor at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its odd harmonic but these all lay at or below –106dB ref 1W into 8 ohms Fig4 Moon 888 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms As its name suggests the Moon 888 is specified as delivering a staggering 888W into 8 ohms  Using our definition of clipping—ie when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1—the amplifier exceeded that output clipping with a 1kHz signal at 990W into 8 ohms  The clipping power didnt double when the load was halved 1300W being delivered at clipping into 4 ohms  but its fair to note that I didnt hold the wall voltage constant for this test However the Moon 888 turned itself off several times during these highpower tests particularly when I tried  to measure the clipping power into 2 ohmsFig5 Moon 888 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Moon 888 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDN changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN was extremely low in the midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  but rose into 2 ohms  In this test I sweep a tone from 20kHz down to 20Hz and you can see that the 2 ohm trace cuts off at 80Hz which was when the amplifiers protection kicked in  This behavior was reminiscent of what happened when  Bricasti Design M15 amplifier reviewed in the July issue I also noticed that when I turned the Moon 888 off and on after one of these incidents the percentage of THDN was at first about twice as high as in fig7 it then took about a minute to drop to the previously measured valueFig7 Moon 888 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fortunately the Moon 888s distortion was predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  and lay at a low –80dB  though the fifth and seventh harmonics rose to the level of the third harmonic at high powers into 4 ohms  Though some higherorder intermodulation products were evident when the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at high power into 4 ohms  these all lay below –80dB and the secondorder difference product at 1kHz was vanishingly low in level at –117dB Fig8 Moon 888 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms 00065 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Moon 888 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig10 Moon 888 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms Overall this is good measured performance I suspect that the Moon by Simaudio 888s aggressive protection circuitry is due to the significant amount of energy that can be stored in an amplifier that can deliver more than a kilowatt into low impedances Footnote 1 I was using the Moon 888s when  spatially averaged frequency responses of the EgglestonWorks Viginti speakers that Michael reviewed in June and one of the amplifiers went into protection a couple of times then
