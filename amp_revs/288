0, Sound Town STUPDM4C four  channel professional amplifier It was purchased new by  drop shipped to me It costs US 540As you see there is a bit of style to this amp with the front panel This is a straight amplifier with no DSPThe fans came on immediately and made moderate amount of noise  As you see input is XLR and output is speakon connectorsI was very pleased to see Audio Precision analyzer graphs in the manual They were quite tiny and hard to read but made me hope that the design was verified through suchSound Town STUPDM4C MeasurementsThe tests you see are all performed using Channels 1  2 on one side Lets start with our dashboardSINAD is below average of all amplifiers tested by 4 dB but for a Pro amplifier it is not badBut there is more going on here There is broad set of noise between 2 and 4 kHz I shut off the signal feed to it and was very surprised to find this noise componentSeems like some square wave with harmonics buzzing around internally that is bleeding into the amplifier Not goodThat noise limited the signal to noise ratioIt also showed up in multitone testNotice how the ends of the spectrum has reduced levels which indicates nonflat frequency responseNot only do we have  load impedance dependency but we are missing the lows as well below 40 Hz or so As such you cant use this amplifier for subwoofer dutyAmplifier is rated at huge wattage so I was shocked to see so little output with 4 ohm loadI am used to seeing power exaggeration in pro amplifier specs but this is in entirely different classStrangely I got identical amount of power into 8 ohm loadIs there some kind of limiter in the unit There must be See what happens when I change frequenciesSee how the curve goes up but then starts to go backward below 1 kHz That is electronic limiter in action Finally crosstalk was very poorConclusionI have hardly seen any audio device show issues in every test I run but here we are I dont understand what is going on here How can they have analyzed the performance using AP yet have so many issues left on the table Did they design change post those measurements This is the frequency response from the manualIt shows flat response to 20 Hz Notice the date is 2003 Is it really that old of a designAnyway I cant recommend the Sound Town STUPDM4C
