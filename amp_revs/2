0, McIntosh MC462     MC462 by running its 8 ohm output at onethird power for 30 minutes into 8 ohms—thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classAB or classB output stage At the end of that time the heatsinks were very hot at 1586°F  I usually precondition amplifiers for an hour but I was concerned that the MC462 would get even hotterThe McIntoshs voltage gain varied according to which output Autoformer tap was used and whether the balanced or unbalanced inputs were used From the balanced inputs the 8 ohm taps gain into 8 ohms was a lowerthanusual 229dB the 4 ohm taps gain lower at 204dB and the 2 ohms even lower at 174dB The gains using the unbalanced input were 6dB higher rather than 6dB lower the latter is usually the case All three sets of outputs preserved absolute polarity  the XLR jacks being wired with pin 2 hot the modern standardThe MC462s unbalanced input impedance measured very close to the specified 22k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced as expected The output impedance was lowest from the 8 ohm Autoformer tap at 009 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 013 ohm at 20kHz The 4 ohm taps output impedance was almost twice that of the 8 ohm tap—not what I was expecting—while the 2 ohm taps was 014 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising to 0185 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±02dB  The channels levels match to within 01dB and the audioband response into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  is flat up to 20kHz Into 2 ohms  a slight topoctave rolloff reaches –04dB at 20kHz The MC462 reproduced a 1kHz squarewave with short risetimes and flat tops and bottoms  suggesting that the amplifiers use of output transformers doesnt affect its lowfrequency reproduction A 10kHz squarewave was reproduced without overshoot or ringing Fig1 McIntosh MC462  frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 McIntosh MC462  smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 McIntosh MC462  smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe McIntosh MC462s channel separation  was superb measuring close to 120dB in both directions below 1kHz though it did decrease to 70dB at 20kHz due to capacitive coupling between the channels at some point in the circuit The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio ref 283V and measured at the highestgain output  and with the balanced input shorted to ground was equally superb at 87dB This ratio improved to 962dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 996dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the MC462s noise floor  revealed spuriae at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics these due to magnetic interference from the AC power transformer All of these spuriae are very low in level however and will not be audibleFig4 McIntosh MC462  channel separationFig5 McIntosh MC462  spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms McIntosh specifies the MC462 as being able to deliver 450Wpc  into a load matched to the nominal output Autoformer tap With clipping defined as being when the THDnoise reaches 1 fig6 indicates that the MC462 exceeded its specification even with both channels driven its 8 ohm output clipping at 516Wpc into 8 ohms  The trace in this graph stops at 1 as that is when the amplifiers protection was triggered Into 4 ohms  the McIntoshs 8 ohm output clipped at 720Wpc  Its fair to note that I dont hold the wall voltage constant for this test with both channels clipping into 4 ohms the wall voltage had dropped from 121 to 1154V The MC462s 2 ohm output delivered 190Wpc  with both channels driven into 8 ohms at 1 THDN 298Wpc with both channels driven into 4 ohms  and 536W  with one channel driven into 2 ohms Fig6

McIntosh MC462  both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig9 McIntosh MC462  both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsFigs 6–9 indicate that distortion is extremely low lying below the noise floor at powers below 30W or so I therefore plotted how the THDN changed with frequency from the 8 ohm output at a level of 283V equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms and 200W into 4 ohms where I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise The result  reveals that the THD into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  rises above 1kHz but still remains below 0007 I havent shown the THDN trace into 2 ohms from this output because it was 2 in the midrange and treble and 3 in the bass at 283V which is equivalent to 400W into 2 ohms The moral Match the MC462s nominal output to the lowest impedance magnitude of the loudspeaker usedFig10 McIntosh MC462  THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The distortion signature is primarily of the second and third harmonics  these components are very low in level even at high powers  though the right channel  had slightly more distortion than the left  Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at high power into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm output the levels of higherorder intermodulation products were extremely low  and the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at a rootsoftheuniverse –114dB Fig11 McIntosh MC462  1kHz waveform at 50Wpc into 8 ohms 000056 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig12 McIntosh MC462  spectrum of 50Hz
