0, Musical Fidelity NuVista 800    As the amplifier is specified as having a maximum power output of 330Wpc into 8 ohms I preconditioned it before the measurements by running it at onethird that power into 8 ohms for an hour Following that period the top panel was warm at 995°F  and the heatsinks hotter at 1219°F With the NuVista 800s volume control set to 1145 its maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was typical for an integrated amplifier at 421dB unbalanced and 423dB balanced The volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps with the error a negligible 013dB at a setting of 795 ie –35dB was actually –3487dB The NuVista 800 preserved absolute polarity for both balanced and unbalanced inputs its XLRs being wired with pin 2 hot The unbalanced input impedance was 42k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to 175k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was 18k ohms across the audiobandThe output impedance including 6 of speaker cable was low in the bass and midrange at 0095 ohm rising to 015 ohm at the top of the audioband Consequently the modulation of the NuVista 800s frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was also very low  The amplifiers response into resistive loads was flat in the audioband with its output into 8 ohms down by 05dB at 20kHz and by 3dB at 70kHz  This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum Commendably both the very close channel balance and the overall response were preserved at lower settings of this control The NuVista 800 performed well with a 10kHz squarewave  with no overshoot or ringingFig1 Musical Fidelity NuVista 800 balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Musical Fidelity NuVista 800 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was superb below 1kHz at 100dB and still 72B at 20kHz The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio taken with an unbalanced input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum was a little disappointing at 572dB left and 526dB right both figures ref 283V into 8 ohms These figures improved by almost 12dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and were also sensitive to the arrangement of the ground connection between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer Fig3 reveals that the random components of the noise floor are higher in level than is usually found in integrated amplifiers and that some odd harmonics of the AC supply frequency are present perhaps due to magnetic interference from the two large toroidal power transformersFig3 Musical Fidelity NuVista 800 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  and with input shorted  With this higherthanusual level of noise the actual distortion in the THDnoise traces  doesnt rise above the noise until just below the actual onset of clipping With continuous drive the NuVista 800 just failed to meet its specified output power of 330W into 8 ohms  with both channels driven at our usual definition of clipping when the THDN reaches 1 Fig4 indicates that the amplifier clips at 310Wpc into 8 ohms a slight shortfall of 03dB though its fair to note that I dont hold the wall voltage constant in my testing The supply voltage was 122V AC with the amplifier quiescent but dropped to 1191V AC when it was clipping into 8 ohms Into 4 ohms with both channels driven the NuVista 800 clipped at 500Wpc  I didnt test its clipping power into 2 ohms as Musical Fidelitys Antony Michaelson had warned me that although they test power and stability etc into 2 ohms I shouldnt expect to operate the amplifier for a prolonged period at full power into 2 ohmsFig4 Musical Fidelity NuVista 800 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Musical Fidelity NuVista 800 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI tested how the percentage of THDN changed with frequency at a level at which I hoped to be able to see the contribution of distortion instead of just noise 20V  Even so fig6 suggests that the THD lies beneath the noise floor below 5kHz or so into higher impedances Though the distortion into 4 and 8 ohms is very low overall it does rise into 2 ohms averaging 001 below 1kHz and reaching 01 above 10kHz Just as I finished the 2ohm measurement the amplifier lived up to Michaelsons warning and muted its output I had to wait until it had cooled down before I could continue the testingFig6 Musical Fidelity NuVista 800 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The THDN waveform  was dominated by random noise However spectral analysis indicated that the distortion signature was primarily the subjectively innocuous second harmonic in the left channel  but with an equal amount of third harmonic in the right channel  But with each harmonic at –100dB  despite the high power level these should not cause concern for listening to music especially as intermodulation distortion is also extremely low Fig7 Musical Fidelity NuVista 800 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0016 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Musical

back when I lifted the 86lb Musical Fidelity NuVista 800 onto my test bench But when it comes to the measured performance of this handsomely styled integrated amplifier there is nothing at all to worry about Footnote 1 When I began testing Michael Fremers review sample of the NuVista 800  I broke it by inadvertently shortcircuiting the speaker outputs at high power As fate would have it the outputstage devices sacrificed themselves to save the powersupply rail fuses The measurements were therefore performed on a different sample
