0, KJF Audio MA01 6channel Amplifier populated with Hypex NC252MP stereo modules It was kindly sent to me by a member I configured it using their online tool and it shows a cost of US 1868Not much to see or talk about as far as the case other than dual fans on topThankfully they did not come on during my testing but it is good insurance to have given the total power this unit can generateThe rear panel shows the usual balanced inputs although in this case it is 14 inchXLR combo jacksFor my testing I focused on channels 1 and 2 Did plan to test the rest of the channels for total power but forgot that I had no way of generating that many balanced outputs so what you are about to see is for stereo only Seeing how the amp modules are stereo anyway this should be representative of what you get even if turned on the rest of them at full powerKJF MA01 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboardWe expect excellent performance from Hypex and we get it there producing well above average SINAD which represents level of noise and distortionSignal to noise ratio is very high indicating a very quiet amplifier32tone test signal simulating music shows very low distortion as wellFrequency response is essentially flat with almost no dependency on whether I used 4 or 8 ohm test loadThis means the frequency response should not change much when you switch one speaker for another Crosstalk is very goodThe meat of an amplifier review is the amount of power versus distortionnoise so lets start with 4 ohmSpec is 250 watts which is what we get if we allow more distortion than I do in the above graphSeems that the power supply is designed to power the amp exactly as specified and no more and hence the lack of increase on bursts Switching to 8 ohm we getI like the lower noise with 8 ohm better than 4 ohmFinally there is a bit too much disturbance when we change frequency and sweep for power than I likeBut as noted on the graph there are far worse examplesConclusionsThe hypex NC252MP stereo amplifier modules do their job to product above average performance while running cool and efficient While I have not yet looked inside the KJF amp from the outside it seems like they have not done anything to lower the performance of these nice modulesI am going to put the KJF MA01 with Hypex NC252MP on my recommended listEdit see teardown here always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
