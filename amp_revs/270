0, Parasound 2125 V2 power amplifier   costs US 899The 2125 has an understated look with just a few touches to keep it from looking boring The only controls in front are for which set of speakers it drives There is more however in the backFor those of you wanting to use it with a sub it has selectable high pass filter of 20 or 40 Hz Trigger is supported as well as bridgingParasound 2125 V2 MeasurementsI had a heck of a time getting stable ratings in the dashboard with channel 1 mostly going nuts on its own I thought this was a grounding problem so tried many things There was hardly a difference It was not until the power measurements that I realized something is going on the amp in the 5 to 20 watt range Anyway here is our dashboard when both channels were behavingMeasured noisedistortion lands the 2125 above average rankingNoise performance is not great at 5 watts but naturally improves at full powerMultitone reflect the average distortion ratingFrequency response is very goodI was however surprised that gain dropped when I activated the highpass filtersAs noted my first power sweep had instability in mid power I thought this was instrumentation error so I filtered the heck out of it and got theseOn reflection though this was amplifier instability as we can see when I sweep the frequencyThere is a frequency dependent hump in distortion which is very strange It is likely due to some kind of voltage rail switchingThere is a lot of power available though in a cool running caseConclusionsThis kind of performance would usually garner my recommendation for the 2125 On reflection though I am worried about increased distortion in the sweet area of power band  5 to 20 watts Company needs to work on mitigating this issue So for now I wont be recommending the Parasound 2125 even though it checks many boxes from value to functionaltiy
