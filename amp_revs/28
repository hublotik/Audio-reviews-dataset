0,Although the ELAC Alchemy DPA2 is a stereo amplifier Jason Victor Serinus auditioned it as a pair of monoblocks  I therefore performed a complete set of measurements with a DPA2 in mono mode then repeated some of the tests in stereo mode As the DPA2 has an output stage operating in classD I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter between the test load and my  system This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slewrate limiting I used it for all the tests other than frequency responseThough the Alchemy DPA2 has both balanced and singleended inputs I performed most of the measurements using the balanced inputs which the manual says are preferred With the amplifier in stereo mode I measured a low voltage gain of 187dB into 8 ohms with both types of inputs and the gain set to Normal High gain mode increased the gain by a useful 59dB In mono mode the DPA2s gain into 8 ohms was 246dB and 304dB on the Normal and High gain settings The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with both inputs in both stereo and mono modes The XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance is specified as 12k ohms singleended and 19k ohms balanced I measured 119k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz for the singleended inputs dropping inconsequentially to 107k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was 18k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz ie 9k ohms per phaseThe output impedance in stereo mode is specified as 003 ohms at 1kHz I measured a very low 0078 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 0095 ohms at 20kHz  The output impedance was a little higher in mono mode as there are now two output stages in series I measured 0105 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 014 ohms at 20kHz Even so the modulation of the ELACs frequency response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker was minuscule at ±005dB  The smallsignal bandwidth was restricted by the lowpass filter between the amplifiers classD stage and its output terminals Into 8 ohms  the ultrasonic rolloff reached –3dB at 50kHz a little more into lower impedances The rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  There is a critically damped overshoot on the tops and bottoms of the waveform but there is no ringingFig1 ELAC Alchemy DPA2 mono mode frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 ELAC Alchemy DPA2 mono mode smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsWithout the auxiliary lowpass filter 191mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the DPA2s output terminals With the AP filter and the DPA2 set to stereo mode and normal gain the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio taken with the singleended inputs shorted to ground was an excellent 82dB ref 1W into 8 ohms It improved to 954dB when I restricted the measurement to the audioband and to 981dB with an Aweighting filter in circuit In highgain stereo mode these ratios were all around 3dB lower they were down another 3dB or so in mono mode Nevertheless this is a quiet amplifier Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor in mono mode  revealed some ACsupply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics though these all lie below –100dB ref 1W into 8 ohms The red trace in fig3 is the spectrum with the amplifier set to normal gain High gain  increased the random noise components by around 3dBFig3 ELAC Alchemy DPA2 mono mode spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with normal gain  and 6dB gain  The Alchemy DPA2s maximum power is specified at 325Wpc into 4 ohms in stereo mode  With clipping defined as when the THDnoise in the output reaches 1 the ELACs clipping power in this mode with one channel driven was 339W into 4 ohms  In stereo mode the amplifier clipped at 202W into 8 ohms  As expected considerably more power was available in mono mode At 1 THDN the DPA1 delivered 590W into 8 ohms  and 550W into 4 ohms  Though the 8 ohm power is a little lower—03dB—than the specified power of 625W  the AC power line had dropped to 1185V with the amplifier clipping into 8 ohmsFig4 ELAC Alchemy DPA2 stereo mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig5 ELAC Alchemy DPA2 mono mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 ELAC Alchemy DPA2 mono mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFigs4–6 show that the Alchemy DPA2 had very low distortion at powers below a few tens of watts I examined how the ELACs THDN varied with frequency at 20V 3 The distortion into 8 ohms was close to 001  though it rose at high frequencies and into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms Fig7 ELAC Alchemy DPA2 mono mode THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The ELAC amplifiers distortion signature in mono mode into 8 ohms was primarily third harmonic in nature  Though some second fifth and seventh harmonics are present  these are all at or below –90dB  At the same output voltage into 4 ohms which is equivalent to 200W the second and higher oddorder harmonics rose in level  though the third harmonic dropped a little With an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones and the signal peaking at 200W into 4 ohms  the decrease in the circuits linearity at very high frequencies resulted in some higherorder products the highest in level of which at 21kHz and 18kHz each lay at –70dB  The difference product at 1kHz even at this very high power lay at –96dB Fig8 ELAC Alchemy

ELAC Alchemy DPA2 amplifier is a powerhouse especially in mono mode Footnote 1 There was one oddity I noted when  DPA2 I have a portable FM radio in the test lab that I keep tuned to WNYC New York Citys NPR station When I powered up the DPA2 and fed it an audio signal I could hear a tone at the frequency of the test signal overlaid with fizzy noise reproduced by the radios speaker This was very noticeable when I swept the test signal down from 20kHz to 20Hz to generate the traces in fig8 I have only encountered this RF interference with one other modern classD amplifier the Spec RPAW7EX that
