0, Emotiva PA1 monoblock class D amplifier   unfortunately discontinued When it was being sold it cost 299There is not much to look at here other than a blue indicator for when the unit is onIt is a balanced amplifier which is niceThere is an automatic trigger as you see I tested it using alwayson modeI believe this is based on some ICEPower module from BO  In use the PA1 didnt even get warm to touch Protection circuit was very good in that if you overload it it clips but keeps going Other amps shut down requiring power cycling and such which an become annoying in my testingEmotiva PA1 MeasurementsOur standard dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm  shows very good performanceDistortion is at 100 dB which is quite nice making SINAD around 92 dBThis is well above our average of 78 across nearly 140 amplifiers tested to dateSNR is very good nearly matching my target of 96 dB at 5 wattsMultitone shows the same good performanceFrequency response unfortunately shows dependency on speaker impedancePower into 4 ohm shows early rise of distortionI cut off the power early in that graph If one allows it to go higher in distortion it produces a lot more powerSwitching to 8 ohm we getChanging frequency shows what nonstateoftheart class Ds produceNamely a transfer function that changes with frequency and much higher distortionHere is the spectrum of the switching frequencyConclusionsIt is hard to get perfection at this price point but the Emotiva PA1 tries hard It is a small package that runs cool yet produces well above average noise and distortion ratings It is a shame it is discontinuedI am going to put the Emotiva PA1 on my recommended list Hopefully you can find some in second hand market or something
