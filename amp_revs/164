0, Siltech SAGA   When I received from Michael Fremer the Siltech SAGA V1 voltage amplifier and P1 current amplifier I hoisted the two chassis up onto my test bench—easier to write than to do given that each weighs 53 lbs—and linked them with a pair of XLR interconnects Although the SAGAs XLR jacks are wired for singleended operation with pins 1 and 3 shorted Siltech recommends using cables fitted with XLRs presumably due to the fact that these when plugged in make the ground connection before the signal connection thus avoiding potentially damaging pulses I plugged the V1s charger into the wall made sure the V1s batteries were charged then turned both units on—only to run into a problemI was getting signal from only the left pair of speaker terminals This was the case whether I ran the V1 voltage amplifier in pentode or triode modes I replaced the cables with no change I then swapped cables from left to right for both the input from the signal generator and for the links joining the chassis fed signal directly to the P1 current amplifier then looked at the V1s outputs It became apparent that the fault was with the V1s right channel presumably something untoward had happened when Michael Fremer shipped the SAGA components to me for measurement As the left channel of this sample serial number 02 appeared to be working correctly according to the published specifications I continued measuring only that channel on an amplifier I usually run it for an hour at onethird its specified maximum power into 8 ohms which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage Although Siltech claims for the SAGA a maximum output of 380Wpc into 8 ohms both Paul Millers measurements in the June 2013 issue of British magazine HiFi News and my own measurement of this sample suggest that 300Wpc is more typical I therefore set the single channel driving 100W into 8 ohms and sat back to wait for the hours preconditioning to conclude But after only 10 minutes the P1 turned itself off I turned it back on but the P1s mute wouldnt lift The P1s heatsinks are internal the top panel was warm to the touch at 1054°F  but according to the manual the muting meant that the amplifier had overheated and that it would not operate again until it had cooled down After it had done so I continued measuringThe SAGA combinations voltage gain measured into 8 ohms depended on the V1s tube mode It was a high 334dB in pentode mode but almost 6dB lower at 277dB in triode mode—both close to the specified figures The P1 alone attenuated input signals by 04dB The SAGA amplifier as a whole inverted signal polarity in both modes though the P1 alone preserved absolute polarity  as you would expect from a voltagefollower circuitThe V1s input impedance was extremely high in both triode and pentode modes at low and middle frequencies at 500k ohms or so  It dropped at 20kHz to 140k ohms in triode and 76k ohms in pentode but these figures are still sufficiently high that the V1 wont load the preamplifier in use to any significant extent The P1s input impedance was also very high at almost 200k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz but dropped again to 76k ohms at 20kHzThe P1s output impedance was higher than is usual for a solidstate design at 023 ohm which resulted in a mild ±013dB modulation of the systems frequency response in both pentode  and triode  modes However this variation is superimposed on a raised treble plateau that reaches 013dB in triode and 04dB in pentode Although this highfrequency lift is small it covers a sufficiently wide frequency range that it should be audible at least in pentode mode Note also that the complete SAGA has a wider ultrasonic response in triode mode than in pentode especially into 8 ohms —an even wider bandwidth than the P1 alone  The P1s response is flat within the audioband meaning that the treble plateau in the system response comes from the V1 This leads to a small amount of leadingedge overshoot in the shape of a 10kHz squarewave Fig1 Siltech SAGA original sample V1 in pentode mode frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Siltech SAGA

Fig4 Siltech SAGA original sample V1 in triode mode smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsSiltechs rationale for splitting the power amplifier into separate voltage and currentamplifier chassis is that this minimizes noise They specify very high signalnoise ratios 128dB for the V1 in triode 138dB for the P1 both measurements IHFA I couldnt measure ratios this high for the SAGA as a whole though that may have been because my SN reference is 283V which is the voltageoutput equivalent of 1W into 8 ohms With the V1s input shorted the SAGAs wideband unweighted SN was 708dB in pentode 788dB in triode Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband respectively increased these ratios to 792 and 971dB while Aweighting further increased them to 818 and 1016dB If Siltechs ratio is referred to maximum power rather than 1W the latter ratios get very close to the specified 128dBFig5 compares the lowfrequency spectrum of the SAGAs noise floor when the V1s input is shorted  with the spectrum when the entire SAGA in triode mode drives a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms  Spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics appear with the amplifier passing signal with 60Hz the highest in level at –80dB  Repeating the spectral analysis with the P1 alone revealed that the P1 is much quieter than the V1 with powerline harmonics 30dB lower than with the P1 driven by the V1Fig5 Siltech SAGA original sample V1 in triode mode spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms  and with V1 input shorted  Siltechs specifications for the SAGA reveal a higherthanusual amount of harmonic distortion but my measurements were much worse than those specs Concerned that this sample of the P1 serial no12 may have been faulty I discussed my measurements with Siltechs Edwin Rynveld It turned out that our sample of the P1 was from the first production run and that a part used in the P1s optical Apollo circuit had suffered a 100 failure rate in the field It worked correctly when first operated so that the amplifier would pass testing in manufacturing but over time it would slowly fail starving the P1s output stage of bias current Ultimately without any bias the P1 would be operating in classB hence the very high levels of distortion that I measured with the residual distortion waveform featuring high levels of crossover distortion Fig6 Siltech SAGA original sample V1 in pentode mode 1kHz waveform at 8W into 4 ohms 0271 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Given the failure of both the V1 and P1 samples on the test bench I arranged to have them shipped back to Siltech and requested new samples When these arrived I set them up on the test bench The distortion of the new sample of the P1  was very much lower than the original sample  suggesting that the revised biasing scheme was working correctly To ensure that everything was working correctly I left the amplifier operating at a level of 2W into 8 ohms However after 20 minutes the amplifier turned itself off apparently due to overheating There had been no indication of instability but the temperature of the bottom of the chassis was 1047°F  and the internal heatsinks were presumably much hotterI let the P1 cool down before turning it on again However after 10 minutes at 1W into 8 ohms an internal relay starting clicking the output waveform was clipped even at this low signal level and the P1s chassis was again very hot Obviously something had gone wrong with this sample tooI returned the V1 and P1 to Siltech and awaited new samples When these arrived—the V1 was serial no16 the P1 was the original sample serial no12 repaired and updated with the new optical part—I performed a full set of tests before driving them over to Michael Fremers so he could redo his auditioningThe voltage gains input and output impedances frequency responses channel separations and SN ratios of these samples were all very similar to the earlier ones indicating manufacturing consistency However when I attempted to precondition the SAGA by running the combination with a 1kHz signal at a lower level than before 20Wpc into 8 ohms the P1 turned itself off after 25 minutes Its top panel was hot at 1202°F  This time however after cooling down the P1 continued to operate with no further problems and I could continue testingThe SAGA in pentode mode now offered respectably low distortion Figs 7 and 8 respectively plot the percentage of THDnoise against output power into 8 and 4 ohms in pentode mode The combination reaches 1 THDN at 350Wpc into 8 ohms  and 580Wpc into 4 ohms  with the specified 8ohm power of 380W  reached at just under 2 THDN The distortion remains below 01 at powers of less than 15W into 8 ohms and of 25W into 4 ohms In triode mode the maximum power was lower as expected with the 1 THDN percentage reached at 88Wpc into 8 ohms  and 170Wpc into 4 ohms  Though respectably low below 1W into either load the distortion rose linearly with power due to the somewhat bent transfer function of the V1s triode circuitFig7 Siltech SAGA final sample V1 in pentode mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig8 Siltech SAGA final sample V1 in pentode

in triode mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig11 plots the THDN percentage against frequency at 11V in pentode mode which is equivalent to 15W into 8 ohms The distortion behavior is somewhat different in the two channels with the left channel  looking more linear than the right  even into 2 ohms  This imbalance appeared to occur in the P1 as the spectrum of the V1s output in pentode mode when outputting 50Hz at 283V into 100k ohms  revealed identical behavior in the V1s two channels the only significant distortion harmonic being the second at –67dB  Repeating the analysis at the same output level but with the V1 in triode mode  again showed the two channels as identical but with the second harmonic now at –60dB  Looking at the P1s behavior on this test at 15Wpc into 8 ohms  the third harmonic is now the dominant distortion component at –71dB  but the evenorder harmonics can be seen to be different in the two channels confirming that it is the P1 in which this linearity imbalance occursFig11 Siltech SAGA final sample V1 in pentode mode THDN vs frequency at 11V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig12 Siltech SAGA final sample V1 alone in pentode mode

sample P1 alone spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 15W into 8 ohms Finally while the original SAGAs behavior on the highfrequency intermodulation test was very disappointing in both triode and pentode modes the new sample was very much better Fig14 shows the spectrum of the P1s output while it reproduced an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 10W into 8 ohms All the intermodulation products lie at or below –81dB  though the difference tone at 1kHz is higher in the left channel  than the right Fig15 Siltech SAGA final sample P1 alone HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms Assuming that these latest samples are representative of current production the Siltech SAGAs measured performance is still somewhat idiosyncratic The V1 offers the user the choice between two different distortion signatures while the P1 offers very high dynamic range provided the high power is not sustained for very long All I can say is that this unusual and expensive amplifier must be auditioned with the prospective owners own speakers to determine if its sonic signature will be optimal
