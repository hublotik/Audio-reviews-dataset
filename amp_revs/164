Siltech SAGA When I received Michael Fremer Siltech SAGA V1 voltage amplifier P1 current amplifier I hoisted two chassis onto test bench—easier write given weighs 53 lbs—and linked pair XLR interconnects Although SAGAs XLR jacks wired singleended operation pins 1 3 shorted Siltech recommends using cables fitted XLRs presumably due fact plugged make ground connection signal connection thus avoiding potentially damaging pulses I plugged V1s charger wall made sure V1s batteries charged turned units on—only run problemI getting signal left pair speaker terminals This case whether I ran V1 voltage amplifier pentode triode modes I replaced cables change I swapped cables left right input signal generator links joining chassis fed signal directly P1 current amplifier looked V1s outputs It became apparent fault V1s right channel presumably something untoward happened Michael Fremer shipped SAGA components measurement As left channel sample serial number 02 appeared working correctly according published specifications I continued measuring channel amplifier I usually run hour onethird specified maximum power 8 ohms thermally worst case amplifier classB AB output stage Although Siltech claims SAGA maximum output 380Wpc 8 ohms Paul Millers measurements June 2013 issue British magazine HiFi News measurement sample suggest 300Wpc typical I therefore set single channel driving 100W 8 ohms sat back wait hours preconditioning conclude But 10 minutes P1 turned I turned back P1s mute wouldnt lift The P1s heatsinks internal top panel warm touch 1054°F according manual muting meant amplifier overheated would operate cooled After done I continued measuringThe SAGA combinations voltage gain measured 8 ohms depended V1s tube mode It high 334dB pentode mode almost 6dB lower 277dB triode mode—both close specified figures The P1 alone attenuated input signals 04dB The SAGA amplifier whole inverted signal polarity modes though P1 alone preserved absolute polarity would expect voltagefollower circuitThe V1s input impedance extremely high triode pentode modes low middle frequencies 500k ohms It dropped 20kHz 140k ohms triode 76k ohms pentode figures still sufficiently high V1 wont load preamplifier use significant extent The P1s input impedance also high almost 200k ohms 20Hz 1kHz dropped 76k ohms 20kHzThe P1s output impedance higher usual solidstate design 023 ohm resulted mild ±013dB modulation systems frequency response pentode triode modes However variation superimposed raised treble plateau reaches 013dB triode 04dB pentode Although highfrequency lift small covers sufficiently wide frequency range audible least pentode mode Note also complete SAGA wider ultrasonic response triode mode pentode especially 8 ohms —an even wider bandwidth P1 alone The P1s response flat within audioband meaning treble plateau system response comes V1 This leads small amount leadingedge overshoot shape 10kHz squarewave Fig1 Siltech SAGA

shipped back Siltech requested new samples When arrived I set test bench The distortion new sample P1 much lower original sample suggesting revised biasing scheme working correctly To ensure everything working correctly I left amplifier operating level 2W 8 ohms However 20 minutes amplifier turned apparently due overheating There indication instability temperature bottom chassis 1047°F internal heatsinks presumably much hotterI let P1 cool turning However 10 minutes 1W 8 ohms internal relay starting clicking output waveform clipped even low signal level P1s chassis hot Obviously something gone wrong sample tooI returned V1 P1 Siltech awaited new samples When arrived—the V1 serial no16 P1 original sample serial no12 repaired updated new optical part—I performed full set tests
