0,   Bel Canto eOne S300iu by running both channels at onethird the maximum power into 8 ohms for one hour Thermally this maximally stresses an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage But with its classD output stage the Bel Canto hardly got warm S300iu using Audio Precisions topmodel SYS2722 system  for most of the tests with the obsolete AP System One bringing up the rear The S300ius maximum gain into 8 ohms was 465dB which is a little higher than usual for an integrated amplifier Measured at the amplifiers preamp output jacks the maximum voltage gain was basically to specification at 196dB while the unitygain setting of the volume control was 80 out of a possible 100 The volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps The S300ius input impedance was 115k ohms across the audioband and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie it was noninverting The preamplifier section also preserved absolute polarity and its output impedance was a consistent 100 ohms across the band significantly but usefully lower than the specified 500 ohmsThe amplifiers output impedance measured at the speaker jacks was 02 ohm at low and middle frequencies dropping to 004 ohm at 20kHz The Bel Cantos frequency response was flat within the audioband but its topoctave behavior depended on the load impedance  presumably due to the interaction between the load and the amplifiers lowpass output filter  Peculiarly the response into our standard simulated loudspeaker  was lower than into an 8 ohm resistive load  despite this load exceeding 8 ohms at some frequencies Perhaps it is relevant that the other channel was driving a 2 ohm resistor when I took this measurement which means that there might be some crossmodulation when the two channels are handling very different signals though I admit this is an unlikely eventFig1 Bel Canto S300iu frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  For all the remaining amplifier tests I used an Audio Precision AUX0025 Switching Amplifier Measurement Filter between the test load and the test systems This is because even with its own lowpass filter a switching amplifier still puts out a high level of ultrasonic noise that without further filtering will drive the input of the test system into slewrate limiting For example without passing an audio signal the Bel Canto S300iu put out 12V RMS of ultrasonic noise with a center frequency of approximately 350kHz This noise compromises the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  to just 8dB Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved the SN ratio to a more respectable 627dB  Channel separation  was excellent at better than 100dB below 800Hz The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was respectable  though with a single critically damped cycle of ringing evident on the leading edges Fig2 Bel Canto S300iu smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms Measured with Audio Precision passive LP filterFig3 plots the percentage of THDnoise in the amplifiers output against output power into 8 and 4 ohms  Surprisingly the amplifier didnt meet its specified maximum output power into either load Defining clipping as when the THDN reached 1 the S300iu clipped at 105W into 8 ohms and 202W into 4 ohms  It did meet its rated power 150W into 8 ohms  at 11 THDFig3 Bel Canto S300iu distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  4 8 ohms Measured with AP passive LPFFig4 shows how the percentage of THDN in the Bel Cantos output varies with both frequency and load impedance  It is hard to discern a pattern in this graph The blue and red traces show the behavior of the left and right channels respectively into 8 ohms Very low at low frequencies the distortion rises by an order of magnitude in the top two audio octaves Into 4 ohms  the THDN at low frequencies and in the top two octaves is a little lower than into 8 ohms but is higher between 500Hz and 5kHz Unusually into 2 ohms  the THDN is even lower at low frequencies than it is into higher impedancesFig4 Bel Canto S300iu THDN  vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Measured with AP passive LPFTo some extent of course it is the spectrum of the distortion that matters not its absolute level At moderate power into 8 ohms the Bel Canto produced predominantly thirdharmonic distortion  which will be subjectively benign Yes higherorder spuriae can be seen in the spectrum  but these are all below –90dB However at the same output voltage into 4 ohms the picture changes completely  While the measured THD percentage has slightly more than doubled the third harmonic has almost disappeared and sharp spikes bracket the waveforms zerocrossing points these equivalent to highorder harmonics  which will be subjectively more offensive Only at low frequencies did the Bel Canto S300iu behave like a traditional amplifier even at high powers into 4 ohms Fig5 Bel Canto S300iu 1kHz waveform at 125W into 8 ohms  0019 THDN

the top octaves gives rise to a disappointing result with the highpower highfrequency intermodulation test While the secondorder component at 1kHz is respectably low there are many higherorder components visible in the top octaves Fig10 Bel Canto S300iu HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms  Measured with AP passive LPFTurning to the S300ius USB input I tested this using my Apple G4 PowerBook as source and analyzing the Bel Cantos behavior at its preamplifier output jacks The USB input is compatible with sample rates up to 48kHz but is limited to 16bit data This will not be a practical limitation given the amplifiers target market I feel The frequency response via the USB input was flat so I havent shown it But examining the internal DACs resolution using my traditional technique of sweeping a 13octave bandpass filter from 20kHz to 20Hz while it decoded 16bit data representing a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS it was apparent that the DAC didnt reach 16bit performance Not only did the peak fail to reach the –90dB line  significant amounts of distortion harmonics were present  The DACs linearity plot  shows increasing amounts of negative error below –80dBFS in effect the DAC is taking energy from the fundamental below this level and pumping it into distortion harmonics Correlating with this the waveform of an undithered 1kHz tone at –9031dBFS which should show three clearly defined DC levels is obscured by noise Fig11 Bel Canto S300iu USB input 13octave spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data Fig12 Bel Canto S300iu USB input leftchannel departure from linearity 16bit data Fig13 Bel Canto S300iu waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data Finally while data streamed to a DAC via a USB connection in theory should be free from wordclock–related jitter the S300ius USB input didnt do well when I drove it with the Miller diagnostic tone Not only were relatively high levels of datarelated sideband energy present in the amplifiers analog output but very strong sidebands could be detected at ±1kHz ±2kHz and ±3kHz  I dont know what these might be due to but the Miller Jitter Analyzer calculated the jitter level as a very high 4 nanoseconds peak–peak As with other amplifiers I have measured in recent years that feature a USB input for digital audio data the Bel Cantos is best regarded as a convenience feature It is certainly not suitable for critical listening in my opinion For that you need to use something like Bel Cantos eOne DAC3Fig14 Bel Canto S300iu USB input highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal  16bit data sourced from Apple TiBook and measured at preamplifier output Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHz It is difficult to sum up the eOne S300ius measured behavior as an amplifier To some extent the amplifier will be a sonic chameleon At low and midrange frequencies it measured very well into 8 ohms But at higher frequencies and especially into lower impedances it misbehaved in a way I would have expected to be audible with some kinds of music I suspect that it is this higherfrequency misbehavior that WP picked up on when he talked about the amplifier as occasionally having a bleached midrange
