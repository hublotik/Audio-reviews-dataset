0, Douk Audio H7 stereo class D desktop amplifier  costs US 144Right away we see differentiation in the form of the nice looking VU meter Not only that there is a control to set it sensitivity which is a must in my view The backlight is nice and bright and goes well with that yelloworange ring The case is machined aluminum so feels nice and heavy for its size The switches and controls are surprisingly robust and impart a feeling of quality In other words this is in entirely different class compared to typical budget desktop amplifiers Surprised continue to the back sideYes we have real full size XLR inputs Of course there is also RCA input but they also added a set of RCA outs I am assuming that is to connect subs and out but there is no internal filteringThe heart of the unit is TIs TPA3255 single chip stereo class D amplifier with very lofty specsWide input range is provided Included power supply is manageable with 32 volts output with 5 amps of current If you are going to drive higher impedance speakers and you want to go louder you may want to up that to 48 voltsOne negative which actually follows some highend gear is dual volume controls Yes to increase or lower the volume you have to crank both of them I would have wanted to see a single volume control with a balance knob As is you can set them once and use an upstream DAC with its volume control  That is how I tested it by setting the gain to 29 dB and treating it as a power amplifier You can see the position of the volume controls in the picture for that gain settingDouk Audio H7 MeasurementsLets start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm load using XLR inputThe SINAD of the good channel at 82 dB is above average for all amplifiers tested But for some reason the other channel  is distorting more which drags the average down someZooming inNoise performance is quite good for class although short of the TI specsAs is typical of budget class D amplifiers the frequency response varies with what load  you connect to it in treble regionThis means you may hear brighter or softer sound depending on exact impedance of the speaker Best to use EQ and tailor that to tasteDistortion is kept very low at 5 wattsThe less good channel lost 1 bit here  So still quite good and more than enough for the applicationCrosstalk is very good for any amplifier let alone a budget oneLets see how it does in power department starting with 4 ohm loadThis is good bit of power and only gets better if we allow 1 THDI ran this three times as I could not believe it breaking into 3 digit department 200 watts out of this little box Granted the test is short term but still that is quite healthySwitching to 8 ohm we naturally get less powerNote that most speakers are around 4 ohm in bass frequencies where most of the volume is so dont go optimizing for this unless you know you have an 8 ohm speaker in that regionEDIT forgot originally to post the power vs frequencyThere is only a dB or so impact due to warm up  so I would just turn it on and useFinally there is likely to be some audible pop on both turn on and offKind of strange to see the blue channel die out that way This may have something to do with that channel also underperforming in the dashboardI had no luck trying to test the H7 with my powercube reactive loadbox It caused some kind of interference that would keep it from switching loads Will need to spend more time investigating what is going onConclusionsThe Douk H7 breaks new ground in multiple areas from nicely done VU meter nice looking case and very good measured performance The only issue is if you can live with dual volume controls I am happy to see such differentiation in this highly price sensitive and crowded marketI am going to recommend the Douk Audio H7 amplifier
