0, Crown XLS 1002 rack mounted pro amplifier   drop shipped to me The 1002 costs US 339 including Prime shipping from AmazonNote our company Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and hence Crown products We use fair bit of Crown amps in custom installs usually to power inceiling speakers and such Member wanted to buy it through us but the margin on it was no more than a cup of coffee  so I suggested he buy it elsewhere which he didNot sure what to say about the look other than it is made to have some style while being ruggedThe LCD with bluish backlight reminds me of displays on electronics back in 1980s I guess at this price they had to cut every pennyI was relieved to see binding posts besides speakon connectorsNow dont laugh but I could not figure out how to pull out the safety plugs they put in the darn binding posts There is no way to grab then and I did not want to put a mark on them by using a sharp tool The manual says only European units have it but clearly that is not correct Anyway I resorted to using the SpeakOn connectors for my testing For input I focused on XLR inputsI set the gain to max to get the nominal 29 dB I have standardized on for testing amplifiersThere is a fan in the back and some inside But none came on that I could hear above the sound of my PC during testing Nothing shut down even when the amp was pushed into clipping Some kind of limiter would kick in after short period to keep the power level at max Temperature of the case didnt even rise above room temp Amplifier Audio MeasurementsPerformance was stable during a 5 minute warm up time so I ran with themStrange to see higher order harmonics dominating the distortion profile  Ratio of noisedistortion to signal as expressed in SINAD is what I expect decent pro amps to produceSlightly below the average of all amps testedSignal to noise ratio is in the same rangeCrosstalk is reasonableFrequency response test shows that everything is digitized due to inclusion of DSP functionality in this ampPower into 4 ohm is healthy as is the case with most pro ampsI was disappointed to see one channel be much worse than the other thoughLetting distortion go higher we get higher power outputThe burstpeak power is not higher because of the limiter I mentioned in the introUsing 8 ohm load gives a more behaved response than 4This indicates the one channel is starving for current than the other I was unhappy to see distortion shoot up at higher frequenciesFortunately in practice there is not much energy up there so you will be operating in low wattage area where distortion is quite a bit lowerFinally I removed my AES filter to get the spectrumSwitching frequency is around 380 kHz and decently attenuatedConclusionsCompetent pro amplifiers target for good enough noise and distortion The Crown XLS 1002 falls in that category so if you were expecting to have anything better for so little money and so much power you would be disappointed But otherwise the amp does what it targets to doI am going to put the Crown XLS1002 on my recommended list for noncritical applications or for driving subwoofers and such
