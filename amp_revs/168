Because darTZeel NHB468s bulk weight also amplifiers needed picked photography soon Michael Fremer finished auditioning I drove system—see January 2008 As We See It—its host computer digital analog oscilloscopes cables rest test gear New Jersey home perform measurementsPrior trekking Mikeys I received several emails designer Hervé Delétraz new circuit topology incorporated NHB468 calls CP2C Hervé explained CP2C patent pending mimicking current source output impedance voltage source think involves mutually contradictory concepts A currentsource amplifier high output impedance meaning frequency response typical loudspeaker feature huge fluctuations By contrast voltagesource amplifier output impedance close 0 ohmsPutting thinking cap I came two possibilities currentsource amplifier low output impedance voltagesource amplifier could achieved First amplifiers voltage gain varied microcontroller according current demanded loudspeaker particular frequency result would flat frequency response However I understand modulating amplifiers transfer function input signal would severe side effects idea likely nonstarterSecond darTZeel amplifier mirror image Quad Devialet feedforward topology The Quad Devialet amplifiers use highquality high–outputvoltage amplifier runs classA cannot deliver much current auxiliary amplifier dumps necessary current load What I thinking combination highquality currentsource amplifier auxiliary voltagesource amplifier However one emails Hervé wrote CP2C achieved simple way This technology fully analog entirely full real time design part audio circuit This idea also unlikely however I see measurements uncoverAlthough MF exclusively used 50 ohm Zeel input auditioning I performed measurements using balanced singleended inputs I didnt time precondition darTZeel amplifier full hour onethird power driving one NHB468s XLR input 15 minutes heatsink amplifiers rear panel warm 95°F The darTZeels voltage gain 8 ohms specified 26dB 32dB

NHB468s frontpanel meter close I measured correctly doubled load impedance halvedThe amplifier preserved absolute polarity XLR RCA inputs The balanced input impedance specified 20k ohms confirmed measurements I measured 10k ohms unbalanced input impedance rather specified 30k ohms difference inconsequential The output impedance specified 028 ohms I measured 03 ohms low middle frequencies rising slightly 031 ohms top audioband This relatively high voltagesource amplifier low currentsource amplifierAnd I ran trouble After measuring RCA inputs gain impedance I switched back XLR input However amplifiers frontpanel meter showed high level noise gain least 6dB higher amplifier clipped 2W 8 ohms Something gone wrong I switched sample—serial number TZUE1468010R—and performed full set measurements sample SN 010L using XLR inputThis samples voltage gains input impedances output impedances identical first sample The audioband response impedances 4 ohms flat 20kHz output 2 ohms 025dB

darTZeels noise floor revealed random noise somewhat higher I usually find spuriae related powerline frequency low level Note way spectrum taken 1kHz tone 1W 8 ohms Referred NHB468s maximum output 8

noted design limited However Hervé noted another email needed finalize adjust things user manual technical specs especially power output bit lower currently indicate website due final tunein launching production already measured beasts I didnt want readjust output power final fine tunein since sound would alteredWith caution mind clipping defined THDnoise reaches 1 I found NHB468 clipped 216W 16

Highorder intermodulation products equal mix 19kHz 20kHz tones peak level 50W 8 ohms relatively low level though secondorder difference product lay –70dB Fig9 Dartzeel NHB468 1kHz waveform 52W 8 ohms

ohms The darTZeel NHB468s measured performance reveals intriguing design though I couldnt find anything would due CP2C circuit And I measuring second sample Michael Fremer found selecting first samples meter options Menu seemed force amplifier reset gain noise distortion returned normal Therefore looks I selected RCA input Menu went back XLR input gain reset correctly leading problems I found As I found occurred samples I suspect must therefore firmware problem could addressed firmware update
