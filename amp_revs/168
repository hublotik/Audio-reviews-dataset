0,Because of the darTZeel NHB468s bulk and weight and also because the amplifiers needed to be picked up for photography as soon as Michael Fremer had finished his auditioning I drove my  system—see the January 2008 As We See It—its host computer my digital and analog oscilloscopes cables and all the rest of my test gear to his New Jersey home to perform the measurementsPrior to trekking to Mikeys I had received several emails from designer Hervé Delétraz about the new circuit topology he had incorporated in the NHB468 which he calls CP2C  Hervé explained to me that CP2C which is patent pending is mimicking a current source with the output impedance of a voltage source which if you think about it involves mutually contradictory concepts A currentsource amplifier has a very high output impedance meaning that the frequency response with a typical loudspeaker will feature huge fluctuations By contrast a voltagesource amplifier will have an output impedance close to 0 ohmsPutting on my thinking cap I came up with two possibilities for how a currentsource amplifier with the low output impedance of a voltagesource amplifier could be achieved First if the amplifiers voltage gain were varied by a microcontroller according to the current demanded by a loudspeaker at a particular frequency the result would be a flat frequency response However I understand that modulating an amplifiers transfer function with the input signal would have severe side effects so this idea is likely a nonstarterSecond what if the darTZeel amplifier were a mirror image of the Quad Devialet feedforward topology The Quad and Devialet amplifiers use a highquality high–outputvoltage amplifier that runs in classA but cannot deliver much current with an auxiliary amplifier that dumps the necessary current into the load What I was thinking of was a combination of a highquality currentsource amplifier with an auxiliary voltagesource amplifier However in one of his emails Hervé wrote that CP2C is achieved by a very simple way of doing    This technology is fully analog and entirely full real time by design it is part of the audio circuit itself This idea is also unlikely however so I will see what the measurements uncoverAlthough MF exclusively used the 50 ohm Zeel input for his auditioning I performed the measurements using the balanced  and singleended  inputs I didnt have time to precondition the darTZeel amplifier for a full hour at onethird power but after driving one of the NHB468s XLR input for 15 minutes or so the heatsink on the amplifiers rear panel was warm at 95°F  The darTZeels voltage gain into 8 ohms is specified as 26dB or 32dB depending on whether the gain is set to 26 or 32 with the frontpanel menu buttons and display Using the XLR input I measured 2067dB and 261dB into 8 ohms unusually the gains with the singleended input were 6dB higher and conformed to the Menu settings The power indicated by the NHB468s frontpanel meter was close to what I measured and correctly doubled when the load impedance was halvedThe amplifier preserved absolute polarity  for both XLR and RCA inputs The balanced input impedance is specified as 20k ohms which was confirmed by my measurements I measured 10k ohms for the unbalanced input impedance rather than the specified 30k ohms but the difference is inconsequential The output impedance is specified as 028 ohms I measured 03 ohms at low and middle frequencies rising very slightly to 031 ohms at the top of the audioband This is relatively high for a voltagesource amplifier but very low for a currentsource amplifierAnd then I ran into trouble After measuring the RCA inputs gain and impedance I switched back to the XLR input However the amplifiers frontpanel meter showed a high level of noise the gain was at least 6dB higher than before and the amplifier clipped just below 2W into 8 ohms Something had gone wrong I switched off this sample—serial number TZUE1468010R—and performed a full set of measurements on the other sample SN 010L using just the XLR inputThis samples voltage gains input impedances and output impedances were all identical to those of the first sample The audioband response into impedances of 4 ohms and above  is flat up to 20kHz and the output into 2 ohms  was down by just 025dB at 20kHz The ultrasonic rolloff varied with the load impedance At 200kHz the limit of the horizontal scale in fig1 the NHB468s output was down by 05dB into 16 ohms by 1dB into 8 ohms by 2dB into 4 ohms and by 4dB into 2 ohms This amplifier has a wide smallsignal bandwidth and its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringingFig1 Dartzeel NHB468 frequency response at 283V into 16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Dartzeel NHB468 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe wideband unweighted SN ratio ref 283V and measured with the balanced gain set to 32 and the XLR input shorted to ground was 723dB which improved to 847dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 872dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the darTZeels noise floor  revealed that while the random noise was somewhat higher than I usually find the spuriae related to the powerline frequency were all very low in level Note by the way that this spectrum was taken with a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms Referred to the NHB468s maximum output into 8 ohms  the levels of random noise components will be reduced by 26dBFig3 Dartzeel NHB468 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The manual specifies the darTZeels maximum power as 475W into 8 ohms  625W into 4 ohms  and 222W into 2 ohms  with the latter noted as design limited However Hervé noted in another email that he needed to finalize and adjust some things in the user manual and in the technical specs especially the power output which is a bit lower than we currently indicate on our website    due to the final tunein we did before launching the production after having already measured the beasts I didnt want to readjust output power after our final fine tunein  since the sound would have been alteredWith that caution in mind and with clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 I found that the NHB468 clipped at 216W into 16 ohms  398W into 8 ohms  205W into 4 ohms  and 101W into 2 ohms  In each case the amplifiers protection circuitry operated soon after the THDN reached 1 This amplifier offers high powers into higher impedances but regarding the reduction in ultimate power into lower impedances Hervé had explained in one of his emails that the 468s circuit is optimized for loads of 6 ohms with the distribution of power as if we would always work into the SOA  not only for the output devices but for the entire amplifier circuit designFig4 Dartzeel NHB468 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 16 ohmsFig5 Dartzeel NHB468 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 Dartzeel NHB468 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig7 Dartzeel NHB468 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThis is also one of the reasons John will measure output powers not at all doubling when load will be halved he wrote and even output power decreasing under 3 ohmsHervé had also predicted that as the NHB468 has no global negative feedback there would be plenty of THD for John This can be seen at high powers into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  as well as in fig8 which shows how the darTZeel amplifiers THDN percentage varied at 8975V with frequency into 16 8 4 and 2 ohms  More significantly even without global negative feedback the traces in fig8 reveal that the NHB468s distortion doesnt increase with frequency which you often see with solidstate amplifiers that dont have a lot of feedbackFig8 Dartzeel NHB468 THDN  vs frequency at 8975V into 16 ohms  8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The waveform of the residual distortion and noise with a 1kHz signal  suggests that the subjectively benign second harmonic is dominant which was confirmed by spectral analysis  though higherorder harmonics are present at lower levels Highorder intermodulation products with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 50W into 8 ohms were relatively low in level  though the secondorder difference product lay at –70dB Fig9 Dartzeel NHB468 1kHz waveform at 52W into 8 ohms 0073 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Dartzeel NHB468 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig11 Dartzeel NHB468 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms The darTZeel NHB468s measured performance reveals it to be an intriguing design though I couldnt find anything that would be due to the CP2C circuit And while I was measuring the second sample Michael Fremer found that selecting the first samples meter options with the Menu seemed to force the amplifier to reset itself after which gain noise and distortion returned to normal Therefore it looks as if when I selected the RCA input with the Menu then went back to the XLR input the gain was not reset correctly leading to the problems I found As I found this occurred with both samples I suspect that this must therefore be a firmware problem and could be addressed with a firmware update
