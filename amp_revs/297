0, AIYIMA A300 stereo amplifier with balanced and Bluetooth inputs  costs US 177I like that you can easily defeat the tone controls now and select one of three inputs allowing the amp to replace a preamplifier as wellEspecially nice is inclusion of power supply which is a rarity in budgetsmall ampsThe speaker terminals are small but typical for the price classI could see an aluminum heatsink in the box for the power deviceIC In use though it never warmed up above room temp Neither the top or the bottom registered a temperature rise which is niceAIYIMA A300 MeasurementsLets start with unbalanced RCA input first setting the gain to 29 dB as with other amps I test with adjustable gainSwitching to balanced we essentially get the same performanceThat distortion spike at nearly 72 dB limits SINAD to below averageIn fairness and comparison to a few amplifiers with much lower gain I also tested the amp at 12 dB gainA bit better but still not enough to cross the average line For the rest of the tests I stuck with XLR input and 29 dB gainHere is our SNRThese are disappointing numbers relative to what AIYIMA has shown it can doMultitone test result is not too badCrosstalk is goodFrequency response unfortunately shows load dependencyKey here is to see if we can get more power out of this small package and we doInterestingly we get almost as much with 8 ohm loadBack to 4 ohm load with short bursts we get a lot more powerFinally there is little frequencypower dependency which is very good for a class D amplifierWarm Up Time MeasurementAmplifier stabilizes quicklyConclusionsIt would have been great if the A300 had followed the footsteps of previous AIYIMA amps but with more power Alas it delivers on more power at the expense of noise and distortion Assuming you dont hear the noise it may be the right trade off in a budget amplifier On packaging I really like the integrated box with XLR inputs Amplifier power supplies can be huge and that is avoided here I am personally snobbish and want my power with low noise and distortion so cant recommend the AIYIMA A300 But your priorities may be different
