0, BK Components AV302 Power Amplifier The AV302 is discontinued but is available on the used market for low price I am told I found one listing with asking price of 175 but not others The good news is that it uses the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE classD amplifier module so the review should be relevant to other amplifiers in the market nowThe BK amp is targeted the CI  market meaning it is usually installed in home and businesses by a dealerinstaller as part of a larger system This amp for example could be hidden behind a flat panel TV powering a couple of speakers For this reason the formfactor and connectivity follows the requirements for this marketHere is the front panelThe business end is on the backAs you can tell there is fair amount of connectivity for home automation I did not investigate them but I imagine you can power the unit on and off remotely to say synchronise with the TV being turned onoffI liked the level control for both channels It is buttery smooth putting many other volume controls to shame Using that I was able to get perfect match between the two channels  something you cant hardly do with any modern amplifier anymoreThe speaker connections use phoenix connectors which while super common in CI industry was not the greatest choice here It was very easy to have the outputs short out if you left any copper sticking out the screw terminal In use the connector did not make tight enough connection causing the performance of one channel to vary as much as 20 dB It was tight by feel but noise level would go up and down if I wiggled it For intended application probably did not matter If you want to use it for hifi home application you may want to hard wire them if you run into the same issue I didIn use the unit barely got warm to touch There is plenty of ventilation on top and bottom which helps in this regard as does the high efficiency of its switchmode power supply and classd amplification modulePower Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard at 5 watt into 4 ohmI adjusted the output gain to 29 dB which means the controls were near max Performance may vary some at lower gain values I used 29 dB since it is probably the most commonTHX recommended gain levelTHDN was 0008 The 50ASX2SE spec from what I recall is less than half at 0003 The discrepancy may be due to gain stage the connector and just variation in units Overall it is in the ballpark of what they advertise  This translates into a SINAD above midpoint of all the amplifiers we have testedSignal to noise ratio is just good enough for 16bit audio playback at 98 dB at full powerOn right is the same measurement but relative to max of 5 watts SNR does not drop much which is very goodFrequency response was dead flat in audible band and quite wellbehaved with output filteringWideband FFT spectrum shows ugliness that we typically see in classd amps  and this is probably a more uglier than the normal pictureMore of a visual scare though than audioMost important measurement for an amplifier is power versus distortion and noise Lets start with the common load of 4 ohmAs you see one channel started to deviate as I said in the introduction But still both of them are smooth and wellbehaved giving us a power rating of 42 watts before hard clipping sets inAt 8 ohm power level drops a lot as you would expectFunny there though in how much lower noise and distortion the AV302 has compared to the NAD T758 AV Receiver  Would be a good replacement for it had it had more power If the modules higher in range have same performance they may be a good application to power home theatersThat said these modules have almost no headroom as their peak power is almost the same as averageThis is because unlike class AB amplifiers the power supply in these classD amps is regulated and so other than some storage in output caps cant provide more juice for short periods Another sign of good design is how the performance of the amplifier varies with level and frequencyEach line pair of the same color  is at a different frequency An ideal amplifier would not care about frequency so all the graphs would land on top of each other Here they vary some but much less than some other amplifiers I have measuredConclusionsThe BK AV302 provides competent performance across suite of measurements It runs cool is efficient and small It easily outperforms mass market AVRs for example Alas there is not a lot of power here so other than desktop speaker application I would seek out something more powerfulOverall I am going to put the BK AV302 and by implication the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE on my recommended list for midlevel performance amplification
