0, Simaudio Moon Neo 340i   I looked first at the behavior of the optional digitalinput board using either SPDIF data sourced from the Audio Precision via optical or coaxial links or USB data from my Mac Book Pro running on battery power To avoid overloading the poweramplifier section I switched the loudspeakers off and looked at the signals at the fixed lineoutput jacks The TosLink input locked to data with sample rates up to 96kHz the coaxial inputs to data sampled at all rates up to 192kHz Apples AudioMIDI app revealed that the Neo 340i operated with 32bit integer data at all sample rates from 32 to 384kHz The USB Prober utility identified the Simaudio as the MOON USB DSD HD Audio from Simaudio Ltd and confirmed that its USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous modeThe digital input preserved absolute polarity  at both the line and speaker outputs A 1kHz tone at 0dBFS gave rise to a level of 189V at the line output though with the volume control set to its maximum digital data at –12dBFS resulted in a level just below clipping The impulse response with 441kHz data  revealed that the Neo 340is reconstruction filter was a conventional FIR type with a sharp rolloff above 20kHz with 441kHz data  The aliasing product of a fullscale tone at 191kHz at 25kHz  is suppressed by 85dB and the harmonics of the fundamental tone are all very low in levelFig1 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i SPDIF input impulse response 441kHz dataFig2 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i SPDIF input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig3 shows the digital modules frequency response with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHz There is a slight imbalance between the channels but the responses follow the same basic shape with a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate With 384kHz data the response followed the same shape as the 192kHz traces but with extended output above 96kHz reaching –10dB at 160kHz Channel separation via the digital inputs was excellent at 105dB below 1kHz and still 85dB at the top of the audio band Noise levels were also low for digital input signals so that increasing the bit depth from 16 to 24 with dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS dropped the noise floor by almost 20dB  implying resolution of at least 19 bits Some lowlevel supplyrelated spuriae are visible in this graph but overall the noise floor is sufficiently low that the Simaudios reproduction of an undithered 16bit sinewave at exactly –9031dBFS was essentially perfect  With undithered 24bit data the result was a wellformed sinewave Fig3 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i SPDIF input frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  Fig4 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i SPDIF input 441kHz data

Simaudio Moon Neo 340i SPDIF input waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data As implied by the blue and cyan traces in fig2 the Simaudios digital module produced very low levels of harmonic distortion with the third harmonic the highest in level at just –106dB  Intermodulation distortion was similarly low and the digital module offered superb rejection of wordclock jitter via both its TosLink  and USB inputs Fig7 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i SPDIF input spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 0dBFS Fig8 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i SPDIF input highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit data  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzFig9 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i SPDIF input highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 24bit data  Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzThe optional phono stage offered 3965dB of gain measured at the fixed lineoutput jacks when set to MM  5765dB of gain when set to MC  With the volume control set to its maximum and the phono stage set to MC a 1kHz tone at 1mV resulted in a level of 456V at the speaker outputs ie a total gain of 732dB The phono module preserved absolute polarity in both MM and MC modes and the input impedance at 1kHz was 46k ohms at 1kHz when set to 47k or 101 ohms when set to 100 The input impedance at the frequency extremes was not appreciably different from that at 1kHz The RIAA error was very small  though the right channel was very slightly higher in level than the left Both channels featured a lowfrequency response that was down by 3dB at 20Hz Channel separation via the phono inputs was good at 60dB and the unweighted wideband signalnoise ratios were also good at 78dB  and 61dB  both measured with the input shorted The Aweighted ratios were even better at a respective 865 and 753dB Fig10 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i phono input response with RIAA correction  At normal levels the 340is phono module offered very low levels of harmonic distortion  and intermodulation distortion  However while the overload margins were very high at low and middle frequencies at at least 25dB  and 29dB  these dropped at 20kHz to just 7dB  and 11dB  Fig11 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 1V into 100k ohms Fig12 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i phono input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 1V peak into 100k ohms The amplifier as a whole offered a moderate 352dB of gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms for both its balanced and unbalanced linelevel inputs and both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity While the balanced input impedance was high at 44k ohms at all audio frequencies the unbalanced input impedance was relatively low at 7200 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz dropping to just 5200 ohms at 20kHz  As a result a tubed source with a high output impedance at low frequencies might sound a little leanThe output impedance at the lineoutput jacks was a low 100 ohms at all audio frequencies Measured at the speaker outputs it was a very low 005 ohm at low and middle frequencies  rising inconsequentially to 008 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the modulation of the Neo 340is frequency response by the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±009dB  The output was down by 3dB at a high 90kHz meaning that a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with short risetimes  and there was no overshoot or ringing The 340is frequency response was the same at all volumecontrol settings and for both balanced and unbalanced inputsFig13 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i unbalanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig14 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation for the linelevel inputs was an even 74dB R–L but lower at high frequencies in the other direction The unweighted wideband SN ratio measured with the inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum was a modest 712dB ref 283V into 8 ohms improving to 874dB when the measurement bandwidth was limited to the audioband and to 902dB when Aweighted These figures were for the left channel the right channels ratios were all 2–3dB smaller due to there being a higher level of spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics in that channel  These ratios and graph were taken with an unbalanced input with a balanced input these spuriae were all up to 12dB higher in level which I suspect is due to the fact that these inputs are carried on a small board connected to the main board with flying leadsFig15 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i unbalanced input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Neo 340is maximum power is specified as 100Wpc into 8 ohms  or 200W into 4 ohms  Figs 16 and 17 reveal that with both channels driven the amplifier clipped at 130Wpc into 8 ohms  and 200Wpc into 4 ohms with low levels of distortion at output powers of a few tens of watts To be sure I was looking at true distortion I tested  how the THDnoise percentage changed with frequency at 127V  Other than into 2 ohms  there was only a slight rise in THD toward the top of the audioband and very little increase into lower impedancesFig16 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig17 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i THDN  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig18 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i THDN  vs frequency at 127V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The distortion signature was predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  though there was also some second harmonic about 12dB lower in level when the output power was 3dB below clipping into 4 ohms  as well as some lowerlevel higherorder harmonics and some supplyrelated spuriae When  340i with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level a few dB below visual clipping on an oscilloscope the secondorder intermodulation product at 1kHz lay at just –96dB  though the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz lay at –74dB Fig19 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0042 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig20 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Fig21 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms Finally looking at the headphone output this offered the same maximum gain as the speaker outputs and was noninverting However as its source impedance was a high 300 ohms the headphone output should be regarded as utilitarianOverall Simaudios Moon Neo 340i offers excellent measured performance I was particularly impressed by its affordably priced phono and digital modules One point should be noted however The 340is heatsinking isnt adequate for sustained use at high powers Before the testing when  amplifier by running it at onethird power into 8 ohms with both channels driven—the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage—its sidemounted heatsinks became too hot to touch after 30 minutes measuring 1606°F  Even the top panel was hot at 1116°F  This amplifier needs to be used in a wellventilated location
