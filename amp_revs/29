0, After checking for continuity and the optimal grounding between the device under test and the Audio Precision System One test gear my usual routine for an amplifier review is to run the amp for 60 minutes at 13 power into 8 ohms This preconditioning both thermally stresses the amplifier and makes sure its operating conditions have stabilized With the Bryston 14BSST however not only was its chassis too hot to touch after just 20 minutes of driving 200Wpc into 8 ohms it turned itself off after 25 minutes While this IHFrecommended test is very much the worst case for a design with a classB output stage and it is unlikely the 14BSST will get this hot under normal use with music it does suggest that the amplifiers heatsinking is underspecified for continuous use at high levels  Once the amplifier had cooled down and turned itself back on I went on with my testing The input impedance at 1kHz was to spec at 148k ohms balanced and 464k ohms unbalanced and the amplifier didnt invert polarity from either input  The voltage gain into 8 ohms was 289dB unbalanced and balanced this dropping by 6dB with the balanced attenuator engaged The output impedance measured 012 ohm across most of the band  rising slightly to 021 ohm at 20kHz As a result of this low source impedance there was very little interaction between it and the speaker impedance just 02dB 01dB according to fig1 This graph also reveals that the 14BSSTs ultrasonic bandwidth decreases with decreasing load impedance The response is 3dB down at 148kHz into 8 ohms at 100kHz into 4 ohms and at 55kHz into 2 ohms The response is down 14dB at 20kHz in the latter case which might be just audible These curves were taken using the unbalanced input via the balanced input the ultrasonic output was slightly more curtailed at 3dB at 105kHz into 8 ohms though this will not be subjectively significant As a result of the high 3dB frequency the 14BSSTs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was essentially perfect   Fig1 Bryston 14BSST unbalanced frequency response at  283V into dummy loudspeaker load 1W into 8 ohms 2W into 4 ohms 4W into 2 ohms   Fig2 Bryston 14BSST smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms Channel separation was superb at better than 110dB in both directions below 3kHz while the Bryston was also very quiet The Aweighted signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms was 965dB The unweighted audioband ratio was only slightly less good at 935dB though this did worsen to 78dB with a wide measurement bandwidth These figures were all for the left channel the right channel was somewhat worse due to the presence of some 60Hz 180Hz and 300Hz hum components Nevertheless these were still well low enough in level to be inaudible This increased noise level in the right channel can be seen in fig3 which plots the amplifiers smallsignal distortion and noise against frequency Other than at high frequencies where there is a very slight increase in THD into the lower impedances in this graph youre really looking only at noise   Fig3 Bryston 14BSST THDN  vs frequency at 283V into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms simulated loudspeaker load  Increasing the power level and averaging 32 separate measurements to reduce the effect of noise reveals that what distortion is present—just 00038—is almost pure third harmonic  There did appear to be some high harmonics  at high power and low frequencies but these are at vanishingly low levels The level of intermodulation products present with the demanding mixture of 19kHz and 20kHz tones was also very low  despite the very high power at which this spectrum was taken 331W into 4 ohms which was close to visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen  Fig4 Bryston 14BSST 1kHz waveform at 17W into 4 ohms  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out   Fig5 Bryston 14BSST spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms   Fig6 Bryston 14BSST HF intermodulation spectrum DC24kHz 1920kHz at 331W into 4 ohms  Finally fig7 plots the percentage of THDN against continuous output power with both channels driven into 8 and 4 ohms and one channel driven into 2 ohms Despite its 600W 278dBW specification the 14BSST delivered no less than 690W into 8 ohms  at the 1 THD point we define as clipping The clip point into 4 ohms was just over a kilowatt  but the amplifier was running out of grunt into 2 ohms with 720W available at clipping    Fig7 Bryston 14BSST distortion  vs continuous output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms
