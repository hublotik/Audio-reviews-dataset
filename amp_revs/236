0, Denon PMA50 Audio  amplifier with included DAC and Bluetooth  a member It seems to be discontinued but when available it cost US 599 I see it on ebay and such from 370 to 450The enclosure is more stout and nicer lookingfeeling than a lot of products in this categoryThe volume control is large and nice feeling It works a bit odd though in that when you first turn it it switches the display to volume level but doesnt do anything with respect to changing the level You need to keep turning it to have it take effectThere is a headphone amp which I did not test yet May do that laterBack panel shows a nice suite of digital and analog inputs but no line out for the DACI performed all of my testing with USB and a bit with analog Aux inputIncluded mains power supply gets rid of the tangle of wires that comes with external suppliesInternally this is a DDFA design which means it accepts digital input and converts it to PWM for amplification Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI started my initial test with USB input to the amplifier and got thisWhile not stateoftheart performance is above average for amplifiers we have tested with respect to distortionUsing analog input degrades performance fair bitWe lose about 5 dB mostly in elevated noise level Note the channel mismatch when you use analog input as opposed to digitalFrequency response using USB input and high sample rate of 192 kHz shows the noise shapingfiltering of the digital amplifierYoung people with good hearing may hear some elevated sharpness Total bandwidth though is better than some other amps we have tested which truncate at 22 kHz and suchLooking at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone we see a very well behaved amplifier despite being classDUltrasonic noise is limited to 60 dB Some other products have peaks as high as 20 dB here There is a single spike at 840 kHz or so which is likely the switching frequencyNote that I did not have to use my AES filter as I usually do with class D amp The analyzer was not confused by the ultrasonic noise as presentUsing USB input we get very clean signal until the amp stops producing power54 watts of power slightly beats the 50 watt specification into 4 ohm Alas this is not much power relegating the unit to office small room useAs expected power drops with 8 ohm loadI suggest getting a 4 ohm speaker to extract the max power out of the unitUsing analog input we can compare the power at 4 ohm to other amps tested Here again the gain was strange as turning it up to 0 dB caused elevated noise and very early clipping So I dialed volume down and drove the unit to 2 volt input to get thisAs we see its modern competitors all have tons more powerThe digital input though does better as we see in this IMD comparisonIf the PMA50 had more power it would be a real contender hereSignal to noise ratio using USB input at nearly 5 watts and max power yielded thisWe barely miss the spec at max power Even at 5 watt though we are reasonably close to noise floor of CD16bit audio So not badConclusionsThe Denon PMA50 seems to be competently designed It has none of the performance quirks of cheap classD amps It has a solid cabinet and controls to go with that engineeringThe big knock against it is modest amount of power and high price relative to competition And in this day and age lack of streaming supportI personally put huge value on power in amplifiers so cant recommend the PMA50 on that front But you have the data and can judge for yourself with your prioritiesQuestions comments critique etc are welcomeThe weather has warmed up and we are having a glorious dry spring which is unusual for us The panthers have noticed the same and have been pestering me for a picnic lunch They may seem small in pictures but they have voracious appetite so I need money for food and drinks for them Please help with this cause by donating generously usingPatreon orupgrading your membership here though Paypal
