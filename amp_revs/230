0, Audiophonics DAS250NC class D amplifier  and stereo DACBluetooth It was requested by  supplied by the company It costs 58250 €  I really like the front panel display It has large font and super responsive rotary encoder that is a delight to use The power switch and input selections feel good as well Back panel shows the fact that only digital inputs are providedIn use the unit was robust in operation and recovered automatically from overloadsAudiophonics DAS250NC DAC MeasurementsUsing preout  performance of the DAC Lets start with our dashboardI was surprised that I could not get more than 08 volt out of the preout Like to see 2 volts Likely this is optimized for the gain setting of the integrated amplifier Distortion is below 110 dB but because output level is rather low noise drags that down to SINAD of 103 dB This is still competent performanceSNR is good enough for 16 bit contentLinearity is near perfectMultitone is quite good until you get to upper registersIMD vs level shows that impact of noise levelThere were regular pulses at 1 KHz which is the USB subpacket buffer sizeI tried changing the filter settings but they seemingly made no differenceMight as well as this is a fine choice anyway Attenuation could be better hurting THDN vs frequencyOverall performance of the DAC is not bad Question is is it good enough to not impact the amplifier performanceAudiophonics DAS250NC Amplifier MeasurementsUsing the same USB input I measured performance by setting the front panel volume control to 165 dB to get 5 watts and change outputThis is very good performance landing the amplifier well above average of all products ever testedZooming inNoise performance is very good almost meeting my 16 bit minimum SNR at 5 wattsFrequency response is nice in that it doesnt show any load dependencyCrosstalk is better than average of all amps testedMultitone test shows very good performance with almost no frequency dependencyI could barely get the amplifier to clip at max digital inputvolume controlThis tells me that we could have a bit more output voltage from the DAC to drive the amplifier This impacts 8 ohm moreNote that you want to operate in clipping region but a bit of power is left on the table as far as measurements are concernedSince the amplifier barely distorts I could not run my standard max and peak power using 1 THD metric I had to dial that down to 03 get max powerI was not able to run burst power due to same issue Note again that this is a good thing in that the amplifier just doesnt distort enough to get more burst powerLets switch the load now from 8 to 2 ohm while also changing the phase angle as to represent capacitive and inductive loadsI am impressed that it handled 2 ohm at all but 60 degrees capacitive Output voltage dropped though so you dont get to keep doubling down Likewise we lose output voltage at the extremes of ± 60 degrees at 4 and 8 ohmFinally as I suspected you get double power on glitch with the amp and DAC powering on in sequence resulting in some noiseConclusionsThe DAS250NC caught my eye from the moment I looked at the website The combination of a DAC and class D amplifier just makes sense to me for most people who only want a digital input Many smart amplifiers exist in this domain but they are usually compromised Seeing a DAC married to hypex amplifier and combined with a nice front panelremote seemed to be the ticket In testing the DAC performance is just good but seems to be mating well enough to the amplifier Any more performance and it would kind be wasted there So I cant complain much A version of this with higher performance DAC and amplifier would be just dandy Overall I like and recommend the Audiophonics DAS250NC
