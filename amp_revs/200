0, Topping LA90 integrated amplifier  costs US 800I must say this is one interesting industrial design Everything oozes style despite the diminutive package This aspect continues in the operation of the unit with the sound of the relays solidly clicking indicating something good is going to happen Here is the side viewWhile quite solid you can pick it up with one hand The small size is aided by a massive external switching power supplyHere are its ratingsBack to the unit you can see three balanced inputs Volume control can be bypassed although I did not do so for my testing You can also operate LA90 in bridged mono mode There is also 12 volt triggerThere are to gain settings One at 10 dB and another at 20 dB Topping LA90 MeasurementsThese are nonbridged mode measurements Bridged setup follows this section Lets start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm in low gain modeI dont need to tell you that this is a stunning level of achievement We have a power amplifier producing almost the same SINAD as a state of the art DAC Using this number LA90 grabs the top spot with ease with a nice gap to bootHere it is zoomedYou might be thinking that it can only do so with low gain but that is not true Even in high gain performance is spectacularIt would still achieve top spot in our rankings and achieve full audible transparencyNot only is distortion vanishingly low so is noise levelFrequency response is flat and wide as expectedBeing class AB design it has no load dependencyCrosstalk is incredibly good although it loses a tiny bit relative to last champ of amplifiersMultitone test shows the very low distortion levelsLets see how much power we haveSo power is modest in nonbridged mode But note how good the high gain mode is so I would feel just fine using that for operation of the unit if you need to Allowing distortion to rise to 1 naturally gets us more powerHere is 8 ohmOops High Power should be High GainChanging frequencies shows the same excellent performanceDespite being pushed deep into clipping the amplifier did not complain until I got to 20 Hz where its over temperature shut it downFinally you dont need any warm upTopping LA90 Bridged Mode PerformanceA shorting wire is provided to connect the two negative speaker bindings together allowing bridged mode from the top two posts Here is our dashboard againPerformance is still exceptional Here is our SNRDue to more power available now we cross the amazing 140 dB SNR threshold What this says is that even if you play at 140 dB the noise level will be at or below threshold of hearing Of course there is not enough power there to do that but basically you know that noise is not part of the equation with LA90 as even 5 watt measurement hits below threshold of hearingWe want to know the power increase though so here it is Now we get good bit of power at 95 watts with almost no penalty relative to nonbridged mode Notice the massive gap as far as noise floor relative to Purifi amplifierAllowing for 1 distortion we getHere is the super wideband spectrum of the amplifier while producing 5 wattsEditPower Tests at 2 Ohm  and 4 Ohm Requests were made to test the amplifier beyond its minimum load impedance specs Lets start with 2 ohm load while driving one channel in stereo mode Dashboard still shows superb performanceLets now sweep the powerYou dont get extra power relative to 4 ohm but the amplifier was stable and did not even go into protection Now lets switch to Bridged mode  and run our power sweep againNow we see the amplifier doubling down producing nearly 200 watts into 4 ohm Again the amplifier was well composed and kept driving into clipping region without complaining or shutting downAgain the above tests are beyond the amplifier specifications and tests I never run as suchConclusionsIt is clear that Topping engineers are bringing their expertise in designing ultra low noise and distortion in headphone amplification to power amplifiers As such they have outdone every amplifier I have measured in that regard getting ahead to capture the 1 position with a large gap to 2 choiceThe amplifier is not for everyone though Power level is modest as compared to competitors And you have that large external power supply My wish is another version of this amp with builtin power supply motorized volume control with bridge mode standard For now we need to celebrate one of the most important development in delivering transparent high fidelity amplification to audiophiles in a very attractive packageIt is my absolute pleasure to recommend the Topping LA90 History is made on this day folks
