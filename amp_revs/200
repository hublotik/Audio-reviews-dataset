Topping LA90 integrated amplifier costs US 800I must say one interesting industrial design Everything oozes style despite diminutive package This aspect continues operation unit sound relays solidly clicking indicating something good going happen Here side viewWhile quite solid pick one hand The small size aided massive external switching power supplyHere ratingsBack unit see three balanced inputs Volume control bypassed although I testing You also operate LA90 bridged mono mode There also 12 volt triggerThere gain settings One 10 dB another 20 dB Topping LA90 MeasurementsThese nonbridged mode measurements Bridged setup follows section Lets start dashboard 5 watts 4 ohm low gain modeI dont need tell stunning level achievement We power amplifier producing almost SINAD state art DAC Using number LA90 grabs top spot ease nice gap bootHere zoomedYou might thinking low gain true Even high gain performance spectacularIt would still achieve top spot rankings achieve full audible transparencyNot distortion vanishingly low noise levelFrequency response flat wide expectedBeing class AB design load dependencyCrosstalk incredibly good although loses tiny bit relative last champ amplifiersMultitone test shows low distortion levelsLets see much power haveSo power modest nonbridged mode But note good high gain mode I would feel fine using operation unit need Allowing distortion rise 1 naturally gets us powerHere 8 ohmOops High Power High GainChanging frequencies shows excellent performanceDespite pushed deep clipping amplifier complain I got 20 Hz temperature shut downFinally dont need warm upTopping LA90 Bridged Mode PerformanceA shorting wire provided connect two negative speaker bindings together allowing bridged mode top two posts Here dashboard againPerformance still exceptional Here SNRDue power available cross amazing 140 dB SNR threshold What says even play 140 dB noise level threshold hearing Of course enough power basically know noise part equation LA90 even 5 watt measurement hits threshold hearingWe want know power increase though Now get good bit power 95 watts almost penalty relative nonbridged mode Notice massive gap far noise floor relative Purifi amplifierAllowing 1 distortion getHere super wideband spectrum amplifier producing 5 wattsEditPower Tests 2 Ohm 4 Ohm Requests made test amplifier beyond minimum load impedance specs Lets start 2 ohm load driving one channel stereo mode Dashboard still shows superb performanceLets sweep powerYou dont get extra power relative 4 ohm amplifier stable even go protection Now lets switch Bridged mode run power sweep againNow see amplifier doubling producing nearly 200 watts 4 ohm Again amplifier well composed kept driving clipping region without complaining shutting downAgain tests beyond amplifier specifications tests I never run suchConclusionsIt clear Topping engineers bringing expertise designing ultra low noise distortion headphone amplification power amplifiers As outdone every amplifier I measured regard getting ahead capture 1 position large gap 2 choiceThe amplifier everyone though Power level modest compared competitors And large external power supply My wish another version amp builtin power supply motorized volume control bridge mode standard For need celebrate one important development delivering transparent high fidelity amplification audiophiles attractive packageIt absolute pleasure recommend Topping LA90 History made day folks
