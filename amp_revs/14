0, Primare A352   As the A352 has a classD output stage I didnt perform my usual preconditioning by operating the amplifier at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour With a classAB output stage onethird power results in the maximum dissipation in the output devices but this is not relevant with a classD design However because classD amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slewrate limiting all  with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz Without the filter there was 433mV of ultrasonic noise present at the loudspeaker terminalsThe Primares voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 258dB from the singleended inputs and unusually 198dB from the balanced inputs  The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with both balanced and unbalanced input signals The balanced input impedance was 13k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance was 147k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 135k ohms at the top of the audiobandThe A352s output impedance was a very low 0067 ohm at all audio frequencies  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore minuscule at ±01dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was flat to 20kHz with then a steep rolloff The Primares reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured a single damped cycle of ringing this presumably due to the output stages integral lowpass filterFig1 Primare A352 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Primare A352 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 90dB in both directions below 2kHz reducing to a stillgood 72dB at the top of the audioband Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and with the auxiliary lowpass filter incircuit the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was 526dB ref 1W into 8 ohms in both channels This ratio improved to 733dB when I restricted the measurement bandwidth to the audioband and to 76dB when the reading was Aweighted Lowlevel spuriae at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its odd harmonics were vanishingly low in level in the Primares lowfrequency noise floor  However a pair of spurious tones of unknown origin were present around 500Hz these low in level but a little higher in the right channel  than the left Fig3 Primare A352 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Primare specifies the A352 as delivering 200W into 8 ohms and 400W into 4 ohms Both powers are equivalent to 23dBW which implies that the Primare amplifier behaves as a perfect voltage source Using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the Primare exceeded its specified powers With both channels driven with a 1kHz signal it clipped at 225Wpc into 8 ohms  and at 460Wpc into 4 ohms Fig4 Primare A352 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsThe distortion at low powers in figs4 and 5 was below the level of the noise floor so I examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN was very low in the midrange into 8 4 and 2 ohms  but rose at higher frequencies The Primare amplifiers distortion at 50W into 8 ohms was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second and third harmonics  these each lying at just –100dB  The second harmonic increased slightly at the same voltage into 4 ohms but was joined by the fifth and seventh harmonics  When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay below –100dB  and higherorder intermodulation products were not much higher in levelFig5 Primare A352 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Primare A352 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Primare A352 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00025 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Primare A352 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig9 Primare A352 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms Fig10 Primare A352 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms The Primare A352 offers respectable measured performance with superb matching between the channels
