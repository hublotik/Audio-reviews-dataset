0, NAD 7050 integrated DAC amplifier and streaming playback It appears the product was announced in 2014 and since discontinued as I cant find it on sale anywhere The cost was USD 999 from what I can gatherThe unit can be used both horizontally and vertically A rotational sensor changes the display orientation conveniently Here is its upright position which I consider better for sound since the electrons can naturally free fall into the speaker terminalsThe outside has what appears to be some sort of rubber glued to it It is soft to touch but picks up dirt very easily and is impossible to clean due to sticky nature of itThe large knobs imply great feel which they dont have They wobble as you rotate them The larger knob is the volume control which had an odd delay in updating the display as you rotated it Overall a good effort has been made to create an unusual design but didnt quite get there in feel and functionalityThe back panel shows off the inputs and speaker outputFor my testing I focused on USB input as I suspect that is the most common interface for consumers Alas the USB interface is class one so only goes up to 96 kHz To get the advertised 192 kHz you need to use the other inputs I downloaded the NAD drivers which nicely gave me ASIO interface for testingThere is an app to control it and I downloaded it from Android play store It is a simple remote control but allowed me to change the audioout to be full range so I could use it for DAC testing Otherwise it is filtered for subwoofer out Despite its simplicity the app crashed on me onceThere is no analog input so I had do all of my testing with USB digital interfaceAs expected from a brand name company the NAD 7050 comes with full set of safety and emissions regulatory certificationsThe amplification in NAD 7050 apparently is a scaled down version of what is in NAD M2 Here is what NAD says about itMy read is that it is a power DAC similar to Lyngdorf TDAI3400 I reviewed recently Measurements will confirm if soDAC MeasurementsAs usual where possible I try to isolate the performance of the subsystems in this case the DAC Here is our dashboard view using USB inputLine Out I hope you are sitting down if you owan the 7050 and use it as a DACWhat the heck is going on here Even at 0 dB the unit doesnt get to 2 volts yet it severely clips resulting all of those harmonic distortions Dialing down to 2 dBFS improved performance but just to 83 dB By then the output voltage was even lower making it not so useful as a DAC anyway My thinking is that this is a split off output from the power amplifier as opposed to a traditional DAC output  I guess for the assumed subwoofer duty it may be OKNaturally with the SINAD as measured falls at the bottom of the graph of DACs testedAfter the first bad impression the 7050 almost nails the rest of the measurements such as linearityAnd jitterSince USB doesnt support 192 kHz I had to run a different multitone test at 441 kHzAmplifier MeasurementsAs usual the dashboard view is at 5 watts of power into 4 ohmAs power amplifier measurements go this is not too bad actually and almost matches the vaguely stated 90 dB spec by NADPower versus distortionnoise is also pretty decentThe downward part of the curve is always dominate by noise as the output level is low Here that part of the curve is flatter than I am used to seeing which is good as far as level of noise Likewise distortion is kept under complete control until onset of sudden and massive clipping at 54 watts This too is good  Stated rating is 50 watts at 4 ohm and we beating that a bit which is nice Then again 50 watts is not that much power in grand scheme of thingsTHDN versus frequency using my default 45 kHz bandwidth shows pretty awful results Suspecting ultrasonic noise at play I reran the test with 224 kHz  in blue which shows that effect quite conclusively One channel is worse than the other though which is strange Note that the drop above a few Khz is due to bandwidth of the test being too low to capture all the harmonics Broadband FFT shows of 1 kHz tone shows us what is going onThis is without my Audio Precision highfrequency filter  All the other tests used that filterOn the extreme left we see our 1 kHz tone as a spike rising to 0 dB or so We have a single and large spike at 850 kHz That seems to indicate to me that 850 kHz may be the switching frequency Given its high frequency the power DAC is running likely with as a single bit converter which would create a lot of quantization noise Noise shaping is used to push that above 30 kHz or so with the peak at about 80 kHz This is the drawback of power DACs as we have seen in the Lyngdorf and SONOS Amp versus class D amplification which doesnt need noise shaping You can see the effect of high frequency noise in the thickened sine wave of the same signal in the insetConclusionsUsually by the time I get to the end of testing I have a good idea of if I like or dont like a device Here I am not quite sure Lets agree that no one should be using the NAD 7050 as a DAC with external amplification as NAD suggests in the manual You will be listening to a heap of distortion products with anemic output to bootThe amplifier seems to have some good tricks under its sleeves with lower than normal noise and very controlled distortion until a very hard limit My issue there is the 50 watt rating for a 1000 device That is just not enough power for a product in this categorySeeing how the NAD 7050 is discontinued maybe it doesnt need my recommendation or lack thereof anyway So I will leave it at that
