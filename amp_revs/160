0,Though no larger than a paperback book the PS Audio Sprout is a complex product with USB SPDIF and Bluetooth digital analog linelevel and analog phono inputs and speaker outputs a headphone output and a linelevel output Testing the Sprout was therefore more complicated than with a typical integrated amplifier  Sprout using my recalibrated  system  As the Sprout is a classD amplifier—it uses an output module sourced from the Scandinavian ElanAbletec company—it produces ultrasonic noise that would overload the Audio Precisions input circuitry I therefore performed most of the tests using ahead of the analyzer an Audio Precision AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz Looking first at the PS Audio Sprout as a conventional integrated amplifier and driving its line input it offered a maximum voltage gain of 258dB into 8 ohms and preserved absolute polarity  The input impedance was on the low side at 825k ohms at high and middle frequencies rising slightly to 94k ohms at the bottom of the audioband The output impedance was extremely low at 003–005 ohm including 6 of speaker cableAs a result the variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was negligible nor was there any change in response as the load dropped from 8 to 2 ohms However note the 75dB peak centered on 67Hz in this graph It appears that the Sprouts speaker outputs offer some compensation for the rolledoff low frequencies typical of small inexpensive speakers then quickly roll off the low bass to avoid overload This equalization would work well with Herb Reicherts KEF and Totem speakers but should have made his fullrange Tekton Enzos sound too ripe However it is fair to note that he didnt comment on any such ripeness Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum Repeating the measurement with it set to 12 oclock gave a slightly lower bass peak but preserved the extended hightreble response The curtailed low bass correlates with the sloped tops and bottoms of the waveform with a 1kHz squarewave  and a slight overshoot is visible on the leading edges However looking at a 10kHz squarewave  reveals that this overshoot is not associated with any ringingFig1 PS Audio Sprout volume control set to maximum frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 PS Audio Sprout smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig3 PS Audio Sprout smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was good rather than great at 65dB in both directions at 1kHz this decreasing to 40dB at 20kHz With the Audio Precision lowpass filter in circuit the Sprouts wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio was modest at 573dB left and 552dB right though restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband respectively improved these ratios to 649 and 614dB Aweighting the measurement gave further improvement to 80 and 82dB Spectral analysis of the amplifiers lowfrequency noise floor while it reproduced a 1kHz signal at 1W into 8 ohms  revealed that there was a regular series of powersupply–related spuriae in the Sprouts output with the 60Hz component higher in the right channel than the left But these spuriae are still sufficiently low not to be heard as humFig4 PS Audio Sprout spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Sprout is specified as having maximum power outputs of 33W into 8 ohms  and 50W into 4 ohms  With clipping defined as the power when the THDnoise in the amplifiers output reaches 1 the Sprout with both channels driven clipped at 32Wpc into 8 ohms  and 57Wpc into 4 ohms  The downward slope of the traces in each of these graphs indicates that the Sprouts distortion actually lies beneath the noise up to 20W or so and is very lowFig5 PS Audio Sprout distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig6 PS Audio Sprout distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsUsually I would have plotted how the percentage of THDN varied with frequency at the voltage where the distortion started to rise above the noise floor However because the bass boost will reduce the Sprouts maximum output at low frequencies I examined this at 3V output Fig7 reveals that the THD doesnt change with frequency other than in the very low bass where the rise is actually associated with the response rolloff At 1kHz the distortion appears to be predominantly second harmonic  though I had to average 64 captures to bring the distortion waveform out of the noise that would otherwise obscure it I performed spectral analysis of the amplifiers output with a 50Hz tone into 4 ohms  at a lower power than usual because the Sprouts protection circuit operated at higher continuous levels into this impedance But again the second harmonic is the highest in level though actually lower in level than the 120Hz supplyrelated toneFig7 PS Audio Sprout THDN  vs frequency at 3V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig8 PS Audio Sprout 1kHz waveform at 7W into 8 ohms

pair of highfrequency tones  the Sprout produced a 1kHz difference tone at an acceptably low –63dB  though the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were 12dB higher in levelFig10 PS Audio Sprout HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 10W peak into 4 ohms The headphone output  again tested with a linelevel input signal offered a maximum gain of 124dB and again was noninverting as was the output at the line output  The headphone output offered a very low source impedance of less than 1 ohm while the line output jack offered 235 ohms  These outputs taken ahead of the main amplifiers classD stage behaved differently from the speaker outputs in the high treble and bass Fig11 shows the frequency response at the headphone output with the volume control set to its maximum  and to 12 oclock  The response rolls off above the audioband and has no boost in the midbass at the lower control setting and only a hint of boost at the maximum setting However the low bass is still rolled off below 70Hz which is perhaps why HR found the Sprout to sound dry and lean with headphones compared with his reference Harmonic distortion from the headphone output was very low  as was intermodulation distortion Fig11 PS Audio Sprout headphone output frequency response at 1V into 100k ohms with volume control set to maximum  and at 12 oclock  Fig12 PS Audio Sprout headphone output spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 2V into 300 ohms  Sprouts phonostage performance at the headphone output so it came as no surprise to find that the response with RIAA correction and the volume control set to its maximum was very similar to the line input response  The ultrasonic rolloff occurs earlier however and is –15dB at 20kHz But note the accuracy of the RIAA equalization and the very close matching between the two channels The phono stage was again noninverting and the maximum gain for phono sources was 533dB at the headphone output and 667dB at the speaker outputs these appropriate for movingmagnet cartridges The input impedance was also compatible with MM cartridges at 42k ohms at 2Hz 45k ohms at 1kHz and 375k ohms at 20kHzFig13 PS Audio Sprout headphone output phono input response with RIAA correction  The lowfrequency phonooverload margin was excellent at 20dB at 20Hz  though this will be associated with the rolledoff bass The margin dropped to an adequate 114dB at 1kHz and 126dB at 20kHz Distortion with a 1kHz tone at 5mV was low with the second harmonic the highest in level at just –86dB Fig14 PS Audio Sprout headphone output phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 5mV input Finally performance of the Sprouts DA converter with both USB and SPDIF data  With the volume control set to its maximum a –12dBFS signal at 1kHz gave rise to 1003V at the speaker outputs 214V at the headphone outputs A fullscale digital signal would therefore clip both outputs with the volume control at its maximum fortunately the control will not be used at its maximum Apples USB Prober utility identified the Sprout as XMOS USB 20 Audio Out indicating that the USB receiver uses the popular XMOS device and that it operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous modeThe DA section preserved absolute polarity and its impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that the digital reconstruction filter is a conventional FIR type Wideband spectral analysis at the headphone output with 441kHzsampled white noise  reveals that the filter has a fairly slow initial rolloff which means that the ultrasonic image of a fullscale 191kHz tone at 25kHz is suppressed by 60dB rather than being buried in the stopband noise floor Both the USB and SPDIF inputs locked to data of all sample rates from 441 to 192kHz A more conventional look at the baseband frequency responses with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHz  shows that the ultrasonic rolloff is identical with all three rates other than a sharp drop just below each Nyquist frequency  for 441 and 96kHz dataFig15 PS Audio Sprout headphone output impulse response at 441kHz Fig16 PS Audio Sprout headphone output wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig17 PS Audio Sprout headphone output frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  The drop in the noise floor that occurred when feeding the digital inputs first with 16and then 24bit data both representing a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  suggested that the Sprout offers about 17 bits of digital resolution for both USB and SPDIF data With an undithered tone at exactly –9031dBFS the Sprout successfully resolved the three DC voltage levels described by the digital data  Feeding the Sprouts digital inputs with the MillerDunn JTest signal gave the same result  too high a noise floor which completely obscures the oddorder harmonics of the lowfrequency LSBlevel squarewave and a regular series of sidebands of unknown origin spaced at ±800 ±1600 ±2400Hz etcFig18 PS Audio Sprout headphone output spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Fig19 PS Audio Sprout headphone output

together an inexpensive system
