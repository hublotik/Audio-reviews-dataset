Luxman SQN150 hybrid integrated amplifier phono stage costs US 3295Can say pretty I knew could Love elegant front panel VU meter Nice set balance tone controls provided wellAs see power amplification provided ECC83 triode drivers going EL84 power tubes Amplifier conservatively designed rate 1010 watts 6 ohms I like look without cage withNot much exciting back modern beefy speaker terminals vintage tube amplifiersThe package smaller one imagines weighs hefty 27 pounds Notice AC terminal doesnt earth ground unit double insulated In testing I found effect earthing unit notFrontend preamps solid stateLuxman SQN150 Amplifier MeasurementsWhen I picked 5 watts standard measuring amplifiers usually fraction amplifier power nearly half available power So relatively speaker distortion plays much strong role would otherwiseThe high second third harmonics set stage far SINAD I wish much power supply noise Sadly amplifier takes ranking second worst amplifier I ever measured far distortionnoiseThose power supply spikes set lower bound dynamic rangeIt bad likely use sensitive speakers low power amplifier numbers may manifest usually doFrequency response extended shows kink indicating kind filterCrosstalk follow usual curve indicating sort resistive element two channelsNormally issue capacitive causes two reference lines seeMultitone supposed resemble music 32 tone shows strong level grass Hard make case hearing detail much masked power levelI dont 6 ohm load used usual 4 8 ohm loads power testingEdit forgot post different frequency sweepsLuxman SQN150 Phono Stage MeasurementsThe amplifier noise distortion dwarfs phono stage I checked frequency responseSo good critical measurementLuxman SQN150 Headphone MeasurementsFor reason I made power measurementSeems usable power availability point view noise distortion quite high Company specifies 16 ohm output impedance wisely recommends using low impedance headphones good reasonThe headphone amplifier simply connected amplifier output using aforementioned resistor eats power It also change frequency response headphone flat So best avoidedLuxman SQN150 Listening TestsMy lab speaker infinity R253 sensitivity 87 dB I connected SQN150 started listen I immediately acknowledge lack power volume control maxed much distortion cause crackling noise I backed moderate listening level sound OK I noticed boominess lows room modes To confirm I switched Topping PA5 amplifier bench boominess gone Likely harmonic distortion amplifier hitting room modes causing extra bassboominess I see speakerssetup lacks bass experience bit itThe volume control kept 1200 oclock By 100 oclock distortion would start set sound would start get grungy rough Past 200 oclock would rather obvious beyond unusable There usable volume sitting 5 feet single speaker With two speakers could double still enough power speaker If audio reviewer cant hear level distortion give testing audio gear Sadly none reviews I read made remark distortion It classic case paying lot getting lot less fidelity enjoymentConclusionsThe high level picture clear wonderful looking presumably well built amplifier The problem using tube technology producing little power I see advantage euphonically otherwise But possible people bass impact positive But cost So much spent little dynamic capability due lack powerNeedless say I cant recommend Luxman SQN150
