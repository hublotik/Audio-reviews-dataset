0, Marantz PM5003s measured behavior using Stereophiles loan sample of the  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain  I run it for 60 minutes at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms Thermally this is the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage At the end of this period the Marantzs case was warm to the touch and the grille above its internal heatsink was too hot to touch Even so the amplifiers heatsinking is adequate for its power levelLooking first at the movingmagnet phono input this offered an appropriate 385dB of gain measured at the Tape Out jacks and preserved absolute polarity  The input impedance was 48k ohms over most of the audioband dropping slightly to 40k ohms at 20kHz The RIAA correction again measured at the Tape Out jacks was superbly flat in the right channel  but less good in the left  with a –026dB shelf in the treble presumably due to a slightly outoftolerance resistor or capacitor The wideband signalnoise ratio  was a good 57dB this increasing to 812dB when Aweighted which is only just below specification The phono amplifier had excellent overload characteristics offering 27dB of margin at all frequenciesFig1 Marantz PM5003 RIAA error of MM phono input The Marantzs line inputs can be operated with the tone controls incircuit or bypassed Marantz calls the latter mode Source Direct The maximum voltage gain was the same in both modes of operation at 379dB into 8 ohms and both modes were noninverting The input impedance was the same in both modes at 24k ohms across the audioband which is insignificantly higher than the specified figure of 20k ohmsThe PM5003s output impedance was fairly low at 01 ohm at low and middle frequencies rising inconsequentially to 012 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the modification of the amplifiers response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker  held to within limits of ±015dB However this graph also shows a 03dB channel imbalance in favor of the right channel  The volume control was set to 200 for these measurements rotating the control clockwise to its maximum setting reduced the imbalance to 01dB now in favor of the left channelFig2 Marantz PM5003 Source Direct frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  The set of curves in fig2 was taken in Source Direct mode  yet a slight  boost can be seen in the upper midrange that will be just audible The amplifier performed identically with the tone controls incircuit but set to their detented flat positions so this behavior is not due to residual tonecontrol equalization The PM5003 has a wide smallsignal bandwidth in Source Direct mode with a –3dB point of 140kHz which correlates with a wellshaped 10kHz squarewave response  However setting the volume control to its maximum position increased the upper –3dB point to well above 200kHz while switching in the tone controls reduced this to 110kHz and gave a very slightly earlier lowfrequency rolloff Fig3 Marantz PM5003 Source Direct smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig4 shows the effect of the treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum positions as well as to their central detented positions  The maximum treble boost and cut was ±10dB at 15kHz and the bass figures were ±11dB at 75Hz both sets are appropriately modest Channel separation at 1kHz was good at 90dB L–R and 80dB R–L but it decreased to 70dB in both directions at 100Hz and to 62dB L–R and 56dB R–L at 20kHz the latter due to the usual capacitive coupling The wideband unweighted SN ratio  was the same in both tonecontrol and Source Direct modes at 68dB Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved the ratio to an excellent 865dB which is basically to specificationFig4 Marantz PM5003 frequency response at 1V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to maximum and minimum positions With both channels active the Marantz PM5003 met its specified maximum output powers of 40Wpc into 8 ohms  and 55Wpc into 4 ohms  At clipping  the PM5003 delivered 42Wpc into 8 ohms  and 58Wpc into 4 ohms   Fig5 shows how the THDnoise percentage in the amplifiers output changed with output power into 8 and 4 ohms the downward slope of the traces below 20–30W suggests that the actual distortion present was below the noise floor and the onset of actual waveform clipping is quite sudden This graph was taken with the tone controls incircuit but set to their flat positions Though the clipping power was identical into both loads to my surprise the amplifier behaved quite differently at lower powers in Source Direct mode  The THDN is the same as in fig6 until 13W into 8 ohms and 26W into 4 ohms  when there is a sudden drastic rise in THD to just over 03 This then drops a little before the amplifier reaches its actual clipping pointFig5 Marantz PM5003 tone controls incircuit but set to flat distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 ohmsFig6 Marantz PM5003 Source Direct distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 ohmsFig7 Marantz PM5003 tone controls incircuit but set to flat THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms This disparity between the two modes can also be seen in the graphs plotting THDN against frequency at 283V  With the tone controls operating  the THD is below the noise at frequencies below 15kHz or so as predicted from fig5 it does rise at higher frequencies due to the usual decrease in openloop bandwidth though this is not to any significant level even into lower impedances In Source Direct mode  however the distortion remains quite high over most of the audioband and comprises many loworder harmonics  By contrast the distortion waveform with tone controls active at the same power level  is mainly secondharmonic in nature though the spikes at the signals zerocrossing points suggest insufficient bias current for the outputstage transistorsFig8 Marantz PM5003 Source Direct THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig9 Marantz PM5003 Source Direct 1kHz waveform at 54W into 8 ohms  031 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig10 Marantz PM5003 tone controls incircuit but set to flat 1kHz waveform at 54W into 8 ohms  0007 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out At power close to clipping the third harmonic becomes the highest in level in tonecontrol mode  while the second harmonic is highest in Source Direct  although a regular series of higher harmonics can be seen in both modes these are much higher in level in Source Direct While the 120Hz powersupply hum component in these two graphs is respectably low in both modes at –103dB left and –95dB right the 1kHz fundamental and the harmonics each acquire a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz in Source Direct  The PM5003 did well in the demanding highfrequency intermodulation test at a power level just below visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope  All the intermodulation products were at or below –96dB  This was with the tone controls active however In Source Direct mode at the same power level  the 1kHz difference component rose from –100dB  to –60dB Fig11 Marantz PM5003 tone controls incircuit but set to flat spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 27W into 8 ohms Fig12 Marantz PM5003 Source Direct spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 27W into 8 ohms Fig13 Marantz PM5003 tone controls incircuit but set to flat HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 22W peak into 8 ohms Bob Reina reports hearing no difference between Source Direct mode and the active but centered tone controls But its measured performance does indicate that the Marantz PM5003 was not working properly in Source Direct perhaps something broke in shipping or when I hooked up the amplifier on the testbench though its odd that both channels were affected But assuming that the PM5003s measured performance with tone controls active is indicative of its intrinsic performance it did well for such an inexpensive amplifier I was worried about the lack of outputstage bias but the excellent MM phono stage is a bonus
