0, TP  RA3 stereo balanced rackmount amplifier  costs US 229Yes this is a new subbrand from Topping I quite like it The large and highly visible volume level is as gorgeous to look at as it is responsive A remote control is provided which is something you dont usually get The remote  allow you to select between RCA and XLR inputFor those of us who have a DAC and an analog source this is all that we needLots of nice touches are there such as independent memory for the volume setting for RCA vs XLR Safe volume settings Trigger support and ability to update firmware in the future Love that despite low cost the power supply is built in You have a hard power switch which puts the unit in standby Push the volume knob or the remote button and it powers onThis line of products at least for now will be sold by Topping direct Alas it is not yet on the website so you may have to wait a bit to order itI dont know anything about the design but based on measurements below it seems to be a highly optimized class D chip architectureTP RA3 Amplifier MeasurementsLets start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 wattsDistortion is kept below threshold of audibility at around 116 dB So noise is the only thing we need to worry about There when combined with distortion nicely lands RA3 in our top 20 best amplifiers ever testedMind you noise performance is excellentSurvey of available music indicates best case dynamic range of 18 bits and TP RA3 gives you that at just 5 watts Allow it to go to its max power and it reaches 20 bitsMultitone showcases the very low distortion in mid frequencies where our hearing is most sensitiveBut if you insist on pumping ear deafening high frequency tones into it in the form of 19 and 20 kHz tones you naturally get more distortionA concern with low cost class D amp ICs is load  dependency Topping has worked hard to make that basically a nonissueCrosstalk is incredibly good besting even our referenceLets measure power into 4 ohmAs noted measurements completely match Topping spec of 130 watts at 1 THDN Not boundless power but very good for many Naturally we lose good bit of power if you have a rare 8 ohm speakerVarying the frequency we do see the class D chip amp create more distortion above 5 kHz or soThere is a bit of a noise spike with power offThere is some inconsequential spikes in one channel in the first short minutes as the amplifier warms upSpeaking of that the amplifier didnt feel to be rising above room temperature in my testing  on top anywayFinally here is the efficiency vs output power Idle power while on is about 9 watts The protection circuit is aggressive in the way it shuts the unit down when pushed hard so I did not try to run my reactive load testsConclusionsIt is remarkable to me how Topping is not only capable of producing new product one after the other they do so while striving for state of the art in performance This is so even though they are bound by the capabilities of the class D chip amplifier they are using I really like the larger form factor as it not only allows better dissipation of heat and inclusion of AC power supply but also makes the unit more substantial and professional looking If they made the rack ears optional they would fit nicely in a home system as wellFeature set is great for this class of product with inclusion of remote control trigger support nice and visible volume level etcIt is my pleasure to add TP RA3 to my recommended list Incredible performance for so little money
