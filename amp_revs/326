0, Rockville RPA16 Professional power amplifier   drop shipped to me It costs US 390The amp has a peak spec of 10000 watts No there is no typo in there It weights 40 pounds18 KG so it does have some meat to it You can probably see the bolt that holds the power transformer on top left So no switching power supply at least Back panel shows nice sub out optionThe fan is variable speed and is mostly quiet at idle But even under modest power it spools up as temps climb making a slightly whining soundThe front controls are analog actually but notched making it harder to select an exact value They are out of sync with each other so one notch is not the same as the other The displayed amount is also off by a couple of dB  There is a builtin limiter and clipping lightRockville RPA16 MeasurementsLets jump right in with our dashboardThat is very odd set of spikes in low frequencies We have the mains 60 Hz noise but also 70 Hz At this power level though spray of distortion at 62 dB sets SINAD though causing it to rank as one of the worse testedIts score of 55 dB is so low that it pulled down our overall median by 1 dB to 78Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts likely due to that power supply noise But there is so much power that when you push it the ratio is not badMultitone test shows that distortion naturally gets worse at higher frequenciesFrequency response is nice and load independent indicating a nonswitching amplifierYou have a choice of two roll offs for sub output Strangely both boost the gain as wellLets see how accurate the power specs are Naturally we dont get there but this is one powerful amplifier generating nearly 1500 watts with both channels combinedLetting distortion go up and with shorter term signal we get even more of itI dont think we have measured this much power before have weEven at 8 ohm you have a ton of powerAs noted though noise floor is high again I think the worst measured Distortion actually doesnt set in until 100 wattsChecking for frequency vs power and distortion we see orderly responseIf you are using it for sub you want to use the above number rather than the 1 kHz power tests shown earlier Fortunately this is still a ton of power considering dual channels are drivenFinally I ran a wideband spectrum test to confirm the design is not switchingAnd it is not There is also good filtering to push the noise levels down so low above a few hundred kilohertz ConclusionsThis is an interesting take on a pro amplifier to go with nonswitching design This makes the amp extremely heavy compared to competition yet the price is maintained and absurdly low Copious amount of power is available if you can tolerate some fan noiseDue to high level of noise I cant recommend the Rockville RPA16 But you are welcome to choose otherwise based on other factors
