0, AmazonBasics Class D 80 Wattchannel power amplifier   drop shipped to me On Amazon it cost US 128 but the owner found it on Woot for just 70 They are sold out there thoughNot a halfbad enclosure especially for the priceIt was so confusing to see dual languages on the front panel and the backI left the bass and treble controls as you see them there For testing I adjusted the gain to 29 dB which is my standard for testingAmazon Basics 80W MeasurementsAs usual we feed the amplifier a 1 kHz tone with enough amplitude to produce 5 watts and see what we getWell this is not good Distortion  is quite high at around 68 dB causing the SINAD to be pretty close to the bottom of all the amps we have testedFrequency response showed high sensitivity relative to  loadCrosstalk was horribleHow the heck they screwed this up The dashed line in teal is a 25 amplifier32tone test shows what we saw in the dashboard more or lessWe cant clear 16 bit content even at max powerPower curve shows early onset of distortionAt least spec is met Sweeping with different frequencies we see distortion rises a lot with frequencyConclusionsI am a sucker for a bargain as much as the next person But there comes a line that I hate to cross and this amplifier forces me to do so There are just so many faults here If you want to use it in a garage or workshop it will be fine and run cooler than little desktop amps That is the only positive thing I can say about itNeedless to say I cant recommend the Amazon Basics 80 Watt amplifierEdit see teardown here always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
