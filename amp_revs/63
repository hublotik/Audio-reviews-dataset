0, Esoteric M1X amplifiers serial number 20014 with my   amplifier following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at oneeighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes At the end of that time the internal heatsinks were fairly warm at 1057°F  though the top panels temperature was just 826°F  As JVS had told me that the M1Xs sound quality improved after a lengthy breakin I then ran the amplifier at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms for another 30 minutes before examining its measured performance The heatsink and top panel temperatures had increased only slightly after this period to1074°F  and 834°F  respectivelyThe Esoterics voltage gain is specified as 285dB I measured 2813dB into 8 ohms for the balanced input 2827dB for the unbalanced input The M1X preserved absolute polarity  with both input types The specified input impedances are 100k ohms balanced and 10k ohms unbalanced I measured an even higher 180k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz for the balanced input dropping slightly to a still very high 146k ohms at 20kHz The unbalanced input was 98k ohms at low and midrange frequencies dropping to 92k ohms at the top of the audiobandFig1 Esoteric M1X frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Esoteric M1X smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe Esoterics output impedance was a low 024 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing slightly to 0265 ohm at 20kHz  The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was very small at ±01dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was down by 3dB just above 100kHz though the increasing output impedance at very high frequencies means that the ultrasonic rolloff into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  was greater The M1Xs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  was superb with no overshoot or ringingFig3 Esoteric M1X spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was a very good 774dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to 85dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 877dB when Aweighted While spuriae at the evenorder harmonics of the 60Hz powersupply frequency were present in the Esoterics noisefloor  these are negligible at –100dB and below ref 1W into 8 ohms I repeated this spectral analysis with a wire connecting the grounding terminal on the amplifiers back panel to the Audio Precisions chassis ground but there was no difference in the levels of the power supply–related spuriaeFig4 Esoteric M1X distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Esoteric M1X distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe Esoteric M1X exceeded its specified output powers of 300W into 8 ohms and 600W into 4 ohms  With our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the M1X clipped with a 1kHz signal at 340W into 8 ohms  and at 620W into 4 ohms  Although the Esoteric amplifiers maximum power into 2 ohms isnt specified I measured 1050W into this load at 1 THDN The wall voltage had dropped from 1202V to 116V at this powerFig6 Esoteric M1X THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Figs4 and 5 indicate that distortion was very low below actual waveform clipping I examined how the percentage of THDN changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The distortion was extremely low in the midrange into 8 ohms  but rose in the top octaves and it was higher into 4 ohms  and 2 ohms  However even at this very high power into 2 ohms the THDN remained well below 01Fig7 Esoteric M1X 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 0051 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Esoteric M1X spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms The Esoterics distortion driving 1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms was predominantly the third harmonic  lying at –66dB  Though higherorder predominantly oddorder harmonics are present in this graph these are all low in level The third harmonic rose almost to –60dB  at the same voltage into 4 ohms Fig9 Esoteric M1X HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms When the M1X drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 50W into 8 ohms  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –94dB  Higherorder intermodulation products lay at the same level or lower At the same voltage into 4 ohms the intermodulation products rose by 3dBThe Esoteric M1X did well on the test bench offering very high power with low distortion and noise
