I used system measure Octave V 40 SE After installing four KT88 output tubes per setup sheet measurements I let amplifier warm morning I checked bias voltage KT88s using frontpanel rotary switch LED display All four LEDs illuminated green according excellent owners manual means Setting OK I took complete set measurements amplifier used alone repeated testing auxiliary Black Box capacitor bank connectedThe maximum voltage gain 8 ohms without Black Box outboard capacitance bank 3875dB V 40 SE preserved absolute polarity ie noninverting The input impedance low middle frequencies 615k ohms usefully higher specified 50k ohms still 51k ohms top audioband The output impedance specified 2 ohms however measured impedance significantly higher 33 ohms 20Hz 43 ohms 1kHz 38 ohms 20kHz I surprised measured impedances lowered Black BoxWith high outputimpedance values variation frequency response standard simulated loudspeaker resulting Ohms law interaction amplifiers output impedance manner load impedance varies frequency reached ±21dB The two channels matched closely audioband 8 ohms though left channel rolled little earlier 20kHz The ultrasonic rolloff fast sign slight peak developing 30 50kHz right channel lower impedances This correlates critically damped overshoot—one halfcycle overshoot ringing—with 10kHz squarewave Fig1 Octave V 40 SE frequency response volume control maximum 283V simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig2 Octave V 40 SE smallsignal 10kHz squarewave 8 ohmsChannel separation modest 65dB 1kHz 38dB directions 20kHz I measure integrated amplifiers signalnoise ratio worstpossible case input shorted ground volume control set maximum The wideband unweighted ratio conditions ref 283V 1W 8 ohms Black Box connected 776dB left channel 785dB right The ratios improved 799 843dB respectively measurement bandwidth restricted audioband 842 87dB Aweighted Spectral analysis V 40 SEs output drove 1kHz tone 1W 8 ohms revealed left channels slightly poorer noise performance due higher level 60Hz channel though –83dB wont audibleFig3 Octave V 40 SE spectrum 1kHz 1W 8 ohms DC–1kHz The V 40 SEs maximum output power specified 40Wpc 4 ohms Figs 4 5 plot THDnoise percentage amplifiers output output power 8 4 ohms respectively We define clipping THDN reaches 1 two graphs indicate impedances Octave clips 265W Adding Black Box didnt increase power clipping However V 40 SE reaches specified power 4 ohms 112 THDN THDN still 118 50Wpc 4 ohms amplifier starts hard clip Below 50W THDN rises linearly increasing power due low level loop negative feedback usedFig4 Octave V 40 SE distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 8 ohmsFig5 Octave V 40 SE distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power 4 ohmsThe distortion 1W low especially higher impedances Fig6 plots percentage THDN frequency 283V 8 4 2 ohms The distortion rises frequency extremes expected circuit topology 2 ohms become problematically high Fortunately distortion content low powers predominantly subjectively innocuous second harmonic even low impedances though joined higher powers highorder harmonics Highfrequency intermodulation distortion Id expected Octaves THDvsfrequency behavior 1kHz difference component—resulting equal mix 19 20kHz tones 10Wpc 8 ohms—reaching –50dB There peculiar rise powersupply–rated spuriae midtreble graph taken Black Box connected Disconnecting Black Box didnt change behavior experimenting various ways grounding amplifier Audio Precision test systemFig6 Octave V 40 SE THDN vs frequency 283V 8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig7 Octave V 40 SE 1kHz waveform 1W 4 ohms 0208 THDN distortion noise waveform fundamental notched Fig8 Octave V 40 SE spectrum 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz 10W 8 ohms Fig9 Octave V 40 SE HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz 10W peak 8 ohms Other anomaly Octaves V 40 SE measured I would expect traditional design uses pair KT88 output tubes channel And like Octaves RE 290 100Wpc power amplifier favorably reviewed Erick Lichte January 2013 issue V 40 SE constructed impressively high standard
