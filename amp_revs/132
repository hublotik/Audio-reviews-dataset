0, Mark Levinson No536 monoblocks     of a power amplifier I precondition it by running it at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes  After an hour driving 133W into 8 ohms the temperature of the No536s heatsinks was fairly hot at 1148°F  and its top panel was warm at 1013°F The voltage gain into 8 ohms for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs was 256dB and both inputs preserved absolute polarity the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was extremely high at 240k ohms 360k ohms balanced and though at the top of the audioband this impedance dropped to 250k ohms balanced these are still very highThe output impedance was low at 01 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 013 ohm at 20kHz The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by just ±01dB  The amplifier offered a wide smallsignal bandwidth the output into 8 ohms  not reaching –3dB until 195kHz Consequently the No536s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured very short risetimes and commendably no overshoot or ringing was apparentFig1 Mark Levinson No536 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Mark Levinson No536 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsMeasured with the input shorted to ground the Mark Levinson amplifier offered a wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio of 71dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This improved to 96dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 993dB when the reading was Aweighted This is a quiet amplifier and while spectral analysis of its noise floor as it reproduced a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms  revealed some supplyrelated spuriae these were all at a very low levelFig3 Mark Levinson No536 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Mark Levinson is also an extremely powerful amplifier With clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 the No536 clipped at 510W into 8 ohms  compared with the specified maximum output into 8 ohms of 400W  It clipped at 800W into 4 ohms  and at 1050W into 2 ohms  I dont hold the wall voltage constant in these clipping tests as I feel that is more representative of how an amplifier behaves in normal use The wall voltage at the 20A circuit that feeds my test lab dropped from 1228V to 1195V with the No536 clipping into 4 ohms and to 117V with it clipping into 2 ohms With the wall voltage held constant the amplifier would deliver even more power into very low impedances The shape of the traces in these two graphs puzzled me Although the level of THDN is extremely low at low powers it starts to rise earlier than I expected and the amplifier appears to become more linear at moderately high powers before it starts to clip I suspect that this behavior is due to there being only a moderate degree of negative feedbackFig4 Mark Levinson No536 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Mark Levinson No536 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe THDN percentage at 283V—which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms 200W into 4 ohms and 400W into 2 ohms—was very low at low and middle frequencies  Though the THD rises at frequencies above 2kHz it still lies below 008 at 20kHz With a 1kHz signal the distortion signature is oddorder in nature  with the second harmonic around 12dB lower in level than the third  At low frequencies however the higherorder harmonics reach the same level as the third and the evenorder products disappear  However it is fair to note that all the distortion components lie at or below –86dB  And while the mix of harmonics varies with frequency it remains constant with output power which some commentators feel correlates with good sound quality When  No536 with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones the peak level equivalent to 200W into 4 ohms  while some higherorder intermodulation products are visible almost all lie below –90dB  and the secondorder difference product is at –100dB Fig6 Mark Levinson No536 THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 Mark Levinson No536 1kHz waveform at 200W into 8 ohms 0013 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Mark Levinson No536 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–10kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Fig9 Mark Levinson No536 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Fig10 Mark Levinson No536 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms Overall the Mark Levinson No536 measured very well its performance uncompromised by its ability to deliver very high powers into lowimpedance loads
