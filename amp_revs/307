0, Behringer NX3000D Pro DSP power amplifier It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me by a member It costs US 399As pro amplifiers go the NX3000D is half attractive especially when on with its amber lights and LEDsThere are variable  gains as you see I did not play with the DSP or menu system but it lets you do such useful things as setting up a crossover to drive a sub There is builtin power limiting in thereThe unit is quite light So light that you think it may fly away given its large and noisy fanThe fan unfortunately is not temperature sensitive and wails away upon power up I am sure saving weight is a big deal when you try to squeeze every dollar out of shipping costs Good news is that as they advertise this thing runs as cool as it can get After a bunch of testing the temperature was the same as the roomNote that speaker connections are SpeakOn which I like but not common in consumer audio Inputs are only balanced XLR14 combo There is extra gain though to use RCA unbalanced with them using an adapter Where I placed the gain knobs provided 29 dB of gainAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we feed the amp 1 kHz and see what else it outputs beside that at 5 watts into 4 ohm test loadWhat it outputs is a bunch of distortion in the form of third harmonic at 3 kHz placing the unit well below averageNote also the disparity in channel output which you can also see in the frequency response measurementThe gain controls are notched so not easy to select any inbetween gains to adjust for thisAnother news is how narrow the bandwidth is Being a DSP amplifier it digitizes the input and it seems to use 48 kHz sampling resulting in bandwidth of 24 kHzNoise performance is not that great at 5 watts falling well below 96 dB we like to see for CDstreaming 16bit contentFortunately at full power  you do clear that hurdleThese amps are sold almost exclusively by how much power they produce versus their cost so lets get into that with 4 ohm loadSeems like the rated power numbers are a fantasy unless they are measured for one channel driven not two as I do Still 400 watts is lots of power in such a cheap package You get a bit more as well if you allow the distortion to rise to 1 and also measure it as a peak Switching the load to 8 ohms naturally lowers available powerSwitchingclassD amps can have complex distortion profiles that highly depend on frequency and power level and we see some of that hereAt higher frequencies different distortion mechanisms become dominant causing the curves to go up and down While I always see some power loss at 20 Hz it is disappointing to see it dip so low to just 268 watts for an amplifier rated at 900 watts Bass is where we need the powerFinally we can remove our filter and examine the ultrasonic spectrum to see what the amp is producing thereSwitching frequency seems to be around 410 kHz which is well above the audible band and is attenuated quite a lot for a switching amplifier  I am not too happy to see so much other junk there though although not audible per seConclusionsPro amps can often make good alternative to hifi amps since they are sold at much lower costwatt than consumer products We get that in Behringer NX3000D but we also get the other drawbacks of pro products in the form of high fan noise And distortion that is pretty high If you can hide it some place and use it to do drive a subwoofer it should be fine But otherwise I think a more quiet amplifier would work better for home hifif than this unitOverall the Behringer NX3000D is not my cup of tea for home use so I cant recommend it
