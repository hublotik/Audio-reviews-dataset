Hegel H95 integrated amplifier DAC streaming support costs US 2000The H95 looks pretty niceI really like large high resolution responsive graphic display What I dont like absence power button front face After research I found bottom I realize without symmetry one two times play something super loud want rush shut hate fact take effort reach power Another thing I didnt like lack acceleration volume control You crank crank turn way downThe back panel shows extra connectively standard analog amplifierVery nice see builtin DAC Ethernet streaming What maximum supported sample rate 96 kHz USB This tells using ancient obsolete USB interface They say ease design save money put toward making DAC better We see thatA simple plastic remote control provided similar see Chinese desktop manufacturers I tend like unusual expensive product come kind remote Usually include heavy harder use remoteHegel H95 DAC MeasurementsThis amplifier I immediately jumped measuring part first But I backtrack I noticed digital input performance worse analog Given line I decided measure DAC using coax input For reason like Hegel DAC I tested past ASIO4ALL interface would see USB input I decided test Coax Here dashboard volume control adjusted produce nominal 2 voltsI dont need tell stunning high level distortion landing H95 seven bottom list 350 DACs testedWhen sweeping IMD distortion level see part problemThis something see AudioVideo receivers set optimal gain drive amplifiers 2 volts looking Even performance good barely showing less noise 9 phone dongle We measure noise itselfThis horrid performance modern DACBack distortion see multitone testJitter performance lackluster I would expect see random ebay DACTo finish suffering poor linearity measurementI think may unseated Schiit multibit DACs poor linearityReally really bad showingHegel H95 Amplifier MeasurementsI first started line adjusted volume get nominal gain 29 dB use integrated amplifier testsNoise distortion averageI expected lot better companys claim fame comparator supposedly detects distortion sends inverted signal amp correct We see plenty amplifiers without circuit performing far better see graph And course products use true feed forward technology Benchmark AHB2 currently occupying 1 spot graphWhats stability issues circuit Check warm performance amplifierI never seen anything like Variations quite large two large spikes It never stabilized even though I let warm far longer amps tune 17 minutes Best case performance actually amplifier powered 805 dB SIAND finishing 795 Switching DAC input one would hope would eliminate source external noise made things worse better regardYou losing 9 dB SINAD due much higher noise floor Why Again AV receivers I dont think I measured kind degradation using digital inputSo I focused analog input Here dynamic rangeI like see 96 dB 5 watts 91 fine The max power performance doesnt improve much powerful amplifierCrosstalk also goodFrequency response flat audible bandPower output 63 watts 4 ohm knee distortion curveAllowing distortion busting sharply increased available powerPower 8 ohm low expensive amplifierChecking frequency dependency see something limiting power amplifier naturally soHegel H95 Headphone AmplifierI usually dont bother testing headphone output type amplifier usually afterthought But company talks improving output noise level relative prior products I decided test Here power curve 300 ohmI like see 100 milliwatts power 80 close enough Switching low impedance get lot power notThe guarantee reason high output impedance precisely haveI amazed day age companies like Hegel aware fact high impedance bad many headphones even budget headphone amps impedance 1 ohm 77 ohm questionConclusionsLets quickly agree DAC headphone amplifiers junk They better leaving You better hundreds products cost shipping tax H95 I watched one video youtuber said preferred sound Hegel DAC Chord Mojo ways Wonder thinks nowThe amplifier H95 good far noise distortion nothing write home Continuous power low amplifier costing 2000 howeverThis bad attempt around I cant see reason recommend Hegel H95 Company needs go back drawing board design performant DACs headphone amplifiers minimum On amplification left behind proper feedforward designs excellent class D tons power As always questions comments recommendations etc welcomeAny
