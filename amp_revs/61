0, on one of the Accustic Arts Mono IIs SN M21JB1258   I repeated some of the tests on SN 1259 the sample that Jason Victor Serinus found had developed a hum toward the end of his auditioning   first sample of the Mono II by running it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time the sidemounted heatsinks were hot at 1206°F  The top panel was also hot at 1041°F The Accustic Arts voltage gain into 8 ohms is specified as 31dB I measured 308dB into 8 ohms with the singleended input unusually the balanced inputs gain was 6dB lower The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  for both inputs The balanced input impedance is specified as 40k ohms which was confirmed by my measurements However I measured 28k ohms at low and middle frequencies for the unbalanced input impedance dropping to 23k ohms at 20kHz While this is lower than the specified 100k ohms the difference is inconsequentialThe Mono IIs output impedance was very low at 0074 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising very slightly to 0082 ohm at 20kHz As a result the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by less than ±01dB  The audioband response into 8 ohms  is flat up to 20kHz with an ultrasonic rolloff reaching –3dB at 100kHz The responses of the two samples matched very closely The Mono II reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing Fig1

1259 developed a hum I didnt find any significant differences in the two samples signalnoise ratios The wideband unweighted SN ratio ref 283V and measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground was a high 79dB which improved to 86dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 892dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the Mono IIs noise floors  revealed that while 1259  did have higher levels of oddorder harmonics of the 60Hz powerline frequency than 1258 these spuriae were still very low in level and will not be audible I dont know why therefore JVS found that 1259 developed a humFig3 Accustic Arts Mono II spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Accustic Arts specifies the Mono IIs maximum power as 300W into 8 ohms  500W into 4 ohms  and 700W into 2 ohms  With clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 I found that the Mono II failed to meet its specified powers Fig4 was taken with 1258 and indicates that the Accustic Arts amplifier clipped at 220W into 8 ohms  I repeated this test with 1259 and got an identical result Into 4 ohms  the Mono II again failed to meet its specified power delivering 385W  at 1 THDN Into 2 ohms  the Mono II clipped at 575W Fig4 Accustic Arts Mono II distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Accustic Arts Mono II distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Accustic Arts Mono II distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsThese  with a balanced input signal I repeated them with a singleended signal and while the distortion was higher at low powers than it had been with balanced drive I got the same clipping powers This is still a highpowered amplifier however Figs 4 and 5 indicate that the distortion with a balanced 1kHz signal is very low at all powers below clipping However when I tried to plot how the THDN percentage varied as I swept the frequency down from 20kHz to 20Hz at a moderate power level 50W into 8 ohms the amplifiers protection operated as soon as it was fed the 20kHz tone I had to reduce the level of the input signal by more than 6dB before I could perform the test without the Mono II turning off its output The results at this lower level are shown in fig7 The THDN in this graph is very low at low frequencies into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms  However as the impedance dropped the distortion started to rise at an increasingly lower frequency reaching high levels at the top of the audioband This behavior suggests that the Mono II has a limited openloop bandwidth with less gain margin available for corrective negative feedback to be applied as the frequency rises Fig7 Accustic Arts Mono II THDN  vs frequency at 8975V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms The waveform of the residual distortion and noise with a 1kHz signal  suggests that the subjectively benign second harmonic is dominant which was confirmed by spectral analysis  The second harmonic is still very low in level however at –110dB  and rose by just 6dB when I reduced the load impedance to 4 ohms When I tried to examine the Accustic Arts intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones I again found that the amplifiers protection circuitry limited the power at which I could perform the test At the highest power I could test the Mono II with this signal equivalent to 40W peak into 4 ohms the secondorder difference product lay at a very low –90dB  and higherorder intermodulation products were even lower in level Fig8 Accustic Arts Mono II 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms 00053 THDN  distortion and noise waveform

ohms I was puzzled by the Accustic Arts Mono IIs measured performance Some aspects are excellent—the low levels of noise the very low levels of distortion at low and middle frequencies with balanced drive the dominance of the second harmonic in the distortion signature the reproduction of squarewaves and the generally excellent matching between the two samples But the Mono IIs inability to meet its specified powers and the dramatic rise in distortion at high frequencies into low impedances are disappointingThe Accustic Arts Mono II is capable of much higher powers at low and middle frequencies than it is at high frequencies especially into low impedances This may not be an issue with classical orchestral music chamber music acoustic jazz or bluegrass but it could lead to problems with highly compressed rock that has high levels of energy in the top octaves I was also surprised by the apparently limited openloop bandwidth  which is uncommon in modern solidstate amplifiers Footnote 1 See fig3 here
