0, Behringer A500 Reference Power amplifier I purchased this unit on suggestions from members from Amazon for just 199 including Prime shippingBeing targeted at the pro market this is rackmount unit with heft heatsinks on each sideFull compliment of inputs are provided from RCA to balanced XLR and TRS No input selector is provided though and the manual warns against simultaneous connection to more than one inputThe plastic volume knobs feel cheap but otherwise it seems to be a sturdy buildThe manual says it has a class AB output stage I am assuming some kind of power rail voltage switching is used to keep power consumption generally low but I have not confirmed thisFor my testing I used a 4 ohm dummy load and balanced XLR inputs Lets get into measurements and see how she didEDIT the first revision of this review had tested the A500 with the input switch set to bridged It has now been updated in proper stereo modeMeasurementsLets start with our dashboardEven though I was using balanced input and outputs from the amplifier we see large contributions from noise from the power supply in the form of 120 Hz and multiple harmonics The harmonic distortion is quite high too with distortion spikes seemingly going on forever So even if the power supply was 100 quiet it would likely still not get better distortionsinad rating A dismal showing regardless underperforming good DACs by whopping 40 dbSignal to noise ratio is rated at 100 and I get numbers reasonably close to itHere is distortion versus powerSad to see a class AB amp not be able to outdo the switching amp in the Topping TP60 with respect to distortion and noise where the two overlapThankfully the Behringer A500 has copious amount of power producing nearly 170 watts prior to clipping Behringers rating is 180 watts at 1 distortion which seems like an honest ratingFrequency response is OK but not as flat as it should be for a power amp in the audible rangeIf there is rail supply switching then it likely has an output filter to get rid of switching noise from that and as a result start to roll off the response as we see aboveI think we have a good picture of A500 performance so lets not torture ourselves anymore ConclusionsWe seem to have a stream of bad luck with bargain amplifiers Sure they provide exceptional value in how little they charge per watt I know I cant make and ship the empty case of this amplifier for 199 But still we want good distortion specs that rise up at least to some of the worst DACs we have ever tested Heck these numbers are no better than some analog formatsGiven the high distortion levels and somewhat uneven frequency response I cant recommend the Behringer 500 If you just want loud amplification then you do have a bargain here
