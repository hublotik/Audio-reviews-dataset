0, Pass ACA Class A stereo power amplifier It is a DIY design by the famous designer Nelson Pass meant to be starter amplifier for people new to audio electronics to build There are many kits available The one loaned to me from a long time friend of the forum The kit seems to cost around US 320 or soThe ACA sample I received comes in an attractive black caseThe design is a Mosfet output stage with a single stage buffer Very modest level of feedback  is provided to keep distortion somewhat under control As you will see the gain is very low requiring full 2 volt of DACs to drive it to max powerHere is the back sideI did not mess with it but I am assuming the single XLR allows bridged mono operationPower is provided by a very beefy external switching power supply which outputs 24 volts with up to 5 amps or 120 watts All of that is put to use in generating copious amount of heat I was told by the owner to let it warm up for a few minutes As you will see in the measurements this actually made the performance worse not betterOverall this is a very nice package if it performsAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard with 5 watt output into 4 ohm Normally this is well below the max power but not in this case as we see laterGosh What happened to aiming for high fidelity This is a distortionfactory if there ever was one The notion that it is mostly second harmonic does not hold true either Welcome to the bottom of our amplifier ratingsLets dig into distortion spectrum at lower power level of just 1 wattSecond harmonic is more dominant than at 5 watt but it doesnt stay there that long Here it is at 2 wattsOur 32tone signal resembling music paints an ugly picture as a resultI was pleasantly surprised how quiet the unit is thoughFrequency response is also very well extendedYou may be able to make an AM radio out of this thing Back to ugliness here is our power versus distortionnoise into 8 ohm loadOh gosh again Only 7 watts of power with SINAD of 38 dBThings dont get much better with 4 ohm loadWe now have distortion climbing into near 10 category at max power of just 74 wattschannelThere was little variation of response with respect to frequencyDistortion level is so high that it is masking secondary sources of itMaking sure this unit matches the reference I compared them to what Nelson Pass has publishedWe are getting very good agreement So this is what the unit is supposed to do Nelson stays with 1 watt output which shows the performance to be betterEDIT I noted on the dashboard that the gain was much lower than the spec I am told that version 16 which I tested now has a spec of 10 dB for gain so we are goodEDIT 2 See this link for bridged mode measurements TestsIs this thing on That is the expression that immediately came to mind after I hooked up the ACA amp to my Sonus Faber Concertino bookshelf speaker Granted the Concertino is speced at 86 dB efficiency but come on I could barely hear it There was no bass naturally But not much above that either And this was with my Topping DX3 Pro at full volumeFor grins I plugged the US 74 tiny little SMSL SA100 Amplifier which I recently reviewed into the setup Now the speakers came alive with lots of bass great dynamic range and detail Yes the amp started to cry when I turned it up much but until that point it left the ACA so far in the dust it was not even funnyConclusionsAs a starter hobby amplifier to get some sound coming out of a speaker with relatively few components the Pass ACA Class A Amp does the job Build it have fun with it and then put it aside and get a proper amplifier Amplifiers need to have a lot more power And much less distortion We are not even close here folksDo I need to tell you that I cant recommend the Pass ACA for hifi listening I hope not
