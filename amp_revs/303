0, Naim Uniti Atom streamer DAC and integrated amplifier   costs US 3799The overall industry design is attractive and has a highend look to it Alas every part of the unit has an ultra sharp edge from heatsinks to edges of the plexiglass  front panel It is a heavy box which makes you really feel those sharp edges as if they are going to tear into your skin It was unpleasant every time I had to move or rotate the unitThe front panel is large and sharp which I like Alas and strangely so it is not a touch screen In this day and age and at this price a touchscreen is a requirement in my opinion A very large rotary control managed the volume It seem to have some kind of acceleration but wasnt very intuitiveHere is the back panelI was surprised to see the compact binding posts that are made only for banana plugs Likewise there is no USB B to use the unit as a DAC Maybe you can use the typeA connector for that but even so it is very unusual choice Nice to see a floating ground switch In my testing it only impacted the networked tests Otherwise it had no effectInclusion of HDMI is very important to allow sound from TV to be piped into itUpon booting and with Ethernet cable plugged in it nicely told me there is new firmware It took something like 10 minutes to download the image and then went into a seemingly infinity cycles of booting dark screen nondescript progress bar and power button that would fade on or off or solid on I left there for probably half hour when it finally seem to be readyThere is the usual app to control it but I opted for the included remote control It too has very sharp edges but otherwise functionalNaim Uniti Atom DAC MeasurementsI started by testing the unit using Coax due to lack of typeB or typec USB port Here is our usual dashboardDistortion dominates causing our SINAD  to barely reach into fair categoryDistortion rises into the noise floor of even 16 bit content so not a good first showing As noted changing the grounding mode made no difference in any of these measurementsThe output stage is capable of higher voltage which is niceGood to see the output does not become all distorted once the internal amplifier is pushed beyond clipping Noise performance is not competitive with even budget DACs but almost good enough for 16bit playbackMultitone distortion was quite highJitter display looks clean but noise floor is high and is masking interference patternsLevels of those spurious tones though is quite low and inaudible We have a rather odd filter responseThis partially contributes to rather poor noisedistortion relative to frequencyFinally linearity matches the fair performance of the rest of the systemNaim Uniti Atom Amplifier MeasurementGiven the choice of analog or digital input I tested both which producing 5 wattsPerformance is very close so I opted to use analog in as that makes the comparison to other amps easier Notice the high power supply noise at 120 Hz  Overall ranking is well below averageFrequency response test with analog input shows a brick wall filter which indicates input is being digitizedShame then that no DSP functionality is provided The roll off filter in the ADC causes some drooping in the high frequenciesCrosstalk response was kind of shaky but overall goodMultitone test once again shows less than optimal performanceRated power is low and that is what we seeSweeping the frequency for power measurement we get orderly responseNotice the typical sharp drop in power at 20 Hz This is why you need more powerful amplifier than you think you are getting Power is needed in bass but the reservoir capacitors in the power supply get depleted and you dont get as much outputNaim Unit Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI expected the headphone output to be junk but it actually is notThat is plenty of output for satisfactory response of high impedance headphones Noise floor is not competitive with any modernrecommended headphone amp but could have been far worse At 32 ohm though available power is much more limitedSweeping the load we see that the headphone amplifier is not capable of much current deliverySo best to stay with high impedance headphonesNaim Uniti Atom Streaming MeasurementsI ran the streaming tests a day later and here I noticed noise bleeding into the outputSo I tried the ground lift switch and it remedied thatSINAD though is dominated by high distortion so didnt matter one way or the other And performance is the same as localcoax SPDIF inputConclusionsPerformance of Naim Atom ranges from fairadequate to rather poor Shame that when you pay so much for a piece of audio not much design hygiene is included I suspect more went into software development and enclosure design than making sure the hardware is performant I hope for a version 2 the company works to substantially improve the performance of these subsystems I am sure many buy a Naim product thinking they are getting great audio performanceI cant recommend the Naim Uniti Atom streaming amplifierPS I was going to give the mailman panther rating to the unit but he is out making deliveries
