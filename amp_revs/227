Devialet Expert 200 Amplifier DAC Phono premaplifier wired streamer It seems generation behind current products offered Devialet The Expert 200 cost US 9650 The Devialet line amplifiers made quite buzz originally announced given unique lifestyle packaging changed yetA combination class A amplifier class D current source used keep size efficiency Innovative time inclusion SD card online configurator change operation unit including repurposing back RCA connectorsThe thin package creates real compromises exclusion balanced analog inputs preamp outputs Usability suffers quite bit well display top unit simply visible afar There provision wallmounting come audiophile going dangle cables itThere substantial remote strangely display That would consume lot power likely requiring charger suchTrying troubleshoot problem let going configurator site downloading SD images 10 times I tell gets old taking SD card unit plugging PC making simple change put back unit wait restart see effect Granted experimentation quite tedious In day age configurator inside unit activated vi app browser The data SD card small anyway So like data intensiveOverall I think looks put way ahead function Davialet amplifiers I planned much extensive review unit sadly right first power sweep shut longer powers back The online brochure talks extensive protection measures Clearly enough I suspect microprocessor board failed opposed amplifier health monitoring I hoping Devialet responsive review failure make good repairing unit I never amplifier fail simple sweep keeps power max secondsAnyway I accumulated enough data I thought worthwhile post waiting response DevialetAmplifier Audio MeasurementsThe Devialet amplifiers digitize analog inputs I thought I start dashboard 5 watts driving using USB inputDistortion products quite low 110 dB However noise floor high low frequencies causing SINAD suffer lot ending metric 92 dB This well average compared amplifiers measured way short stateoftheartAnalog input creates lot harmonic distortion drags SINAD notches stillI dont understand ADC could distort much product expensive It cant even clear 15 bits distortionfree rangeThere lofty numbers like 130 dB noise floor thrown around Devialet I sure computed Using analog Linein consistency amplifier measurements get rather ordinary numbersCrosstalk good state artAt point I went measure simple frequency response got stomped big time No matter I output would drop randomly 8 10 kHz As mentioned I messed configurator everything power turn filters tone controls etc nothing helped So I dug feeding amp 15 kHz tone noticed output would jump especially one channel What heck going onMy frequency response testing 5 watts I use dashboard Turns amplifier cannot reproduce high frequencies reliably 5 watts It kind limiter kicks pulls power back It also low frequencies past maximum power That I sort understand high frequency hold back To see action I ran THDN vs Level vs Power testFocus red line first That 20 kHz Notice actually zigzags back forth input level increased output level Or even goes backward This must good channel produced 10 watts The channel finicky noted would get upset even 5 wattsProblem severity goes frequencies still 10 kHz indicated light blue line zips back around 180 watts soAt lower frequencies amp simply refuses increase power go clippingWith knowledge I reduced output power 1 watt ran frequency response sweepThis linein digitized It produces 48 kHz bandwidth fine What fine phase shift channels frequencies go upSome kind filter active causing phase shift channels Even processing active affect channels equally far phaseOur story ends power measurement notedThis healthy amount power 269 watts channels driven 4 ohmsConclusionsWhile Devialet elegant looking audio device clearly sacrifices usability reliabilityperformance get There something clearly wrong way handles high frequencies No saying It also buried stereophile measurement another one units 10000 amplifier cant produce 20 watts high frequencies without power supply collapsing Conclusions like dont helpNo testament good amplifier get No amplifier power limit 20 watts high frequencies We issues class D amps generating band noise causes measurements low regard But producing full power Not Devialet Then phase shift Poor usability sneaker net style shuffling SD cards back forth make simple changesAnd course total failure unit simple industry standard test power sweepI feel sad amplifier failed watch I hope Devialet steps makes right owner
