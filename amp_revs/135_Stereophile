When I received sample Moonriver 404 Reference Jason Victor Serinus auditioned serial number DK201002153RE rattled I unpacked I removed top cover saw amplifier incurred damage transcontinental journey The heavy toroidal power transformer mounted one side large printed circuit board occupies almost amplifiers internal space two aluminum straps connecting board central internal heatsink provide necessary support The box must dropped top journey two aluminum straps fractured one loose inside chassis When I connected amplifier system left channel dead though I able perform complete set tests right channel using linelevel inputsI let Editor Jim Austin Moonrivers US distributor Philip OHanlon On Higher Note know situation OHanlon told would running change production provide support transformer arranged Moonriver ship second sample directly SwedenThis sample serial number DK201120164RE arrived without shipping damage I resumed testing Although internal heatsink doesnt look
