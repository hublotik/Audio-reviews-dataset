0, five channel Classe Sigma AMP5 It was kindly sent to me by  originally cost US 5000 I see one on ebay for 1900 right nowThis is one heavy amplifier for a class D architectureAt first I thought it had a linear power supply and its transformer was the reason behind the weight Alas looking into other reviews and pictures inside it uses a switching power supply So all the weight is from the enclosure and likely the very thick front plateAt first I was hoping that the glossy front where the logo is is an LCD display with VU meters and such But there is not It is just for looks I must say as highend products go it is not that attractive to me relative to the high cost of the enclosure It has sharp corners which is not niceThe back shows quality selection of partsI like the staggered speaker binding posts which makes it easier to plug things in XLR connections is what I like to see in an amp in this price range and we have them This amp was mated to their processor of the time which I suspect is discontinued longer than this ampAmplifier MeasurementsI tested two channels  using XLR input Here is our dashboardRather high second and third harmonics dominate causing the overall ranking to be middle of the roadNice to see precise channel matching thoughFrequency response showed unexpected resultsResearching I found out there is an analog to digital converter which explains the sharp cut off I thought that meant DSP functions but there is none Instead the digital signal is used as part of a protection circuit I can see that as a parallel path but not as the main path compromising the response this way This amp came out in 2015 so it is not like we didnt have higher sample rates available then to at least go up to 48 kHz and get us flat audible responseSignal to noise ratio is middle of the road as wellCrosstalk is OK but should be betterPower vs distortion shows odd response at 4 ohm which gets worse at 8 ohm Very strange noise response at the start and the multiple sources of distortion take over each causing their own nonlinearities On the positive front we have healthy amount of power Not much more is available though in burst mode Here is power into 8 ohmThat step function is quite bizarre Worst measurements came when bandwidth was increased to 45 kHz and frequency sweeps were usedNo way this amplifier is so well behaved Instead I think there is high amplitude noise that is masking any distortion present  We can see that if we perform a wideband frequency analysisWe see sharp increase in noise right above audible band This is either caused by noise shaping in the ADC the Amp or both and explains the previous graphThere is naturally switching spikes  but I am disappointed that its level is just 8 dB or so below our fundamental I like to see 20 dB or more attenuation ConclusionsThis is a custom Class D design and switching power supply from Classe It clearly shows deficiencies of the design and creating a market for Hypex to come and show how class D is done Digitizing the input is not a good idea if there is no user benefit to it and there is none hereWe could get depressed about the above or look at copious amount of power this amplifier produces while remaining cool  Since lack of power is the 1 reason amps sound bad I am going to put enough emphasis on this as to not give it a failing gradeOverall I am neutral on the Classe Amp5 At current sale prices you have about 400 per channel for 400 watts of power It may be hard to match this with Hypex amp so you decide if it is worth it or not
