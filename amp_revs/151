0,  I thermally stress it by running both channels for 60 minutes into 8 ohms at onethird the specified power—in the case of the Naim Supernait 27Wpc The THDnoise percentage was 0025 at the beginning of that period it hadnt significantly changed at the end by which time the amplifiers case was quite hot though not so that I couldnt keep my hand on itLooking first at the Naims digital input it locked on to data with sample rates ranging from 32 to 96kHz and the input was noninverting A signal at 0dBFS gave a level that clipped the Supernaits main output with the volume control at 10 oclock With the volume control full a digital signal at –265dBFS clipped the speaker outputs meaning that the amplifier as a whole has way too much gain for its digital input Surprisingly the frequency response above the audioband with 96kHzsampled data assessed at the tape output  merely continued the slight topoctave rolloff evident with CD data  with a –3dB point of 31kHz The output with CD data was down 025dB at 20kHz and the channels were very well matched in levelFig1 Naim Supernait frequency response into 100k ohms with external data sampled at 96kHz  and at 441kHz  Spectral analysis of the Supernaits tape output while it decoded dithered 16bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS have the top pair of traces in fig2 The tone peaks at the correct level and the highfrequency noise floor is that of the recorded dither However at lower frequencies there is a bump to –117dBFS at the supplyrelated frequency of 60Hz Extending the word length to 24 bits and driving the Supernait with dithered data representing 1kHz tones at –90dBFS and –120dBFS gave the middle and bottom pairs of traces in fig2 The noise floor drops by 15dB at high frequencies suggesting a true DA resolution of around 18 bits but a series of oddorder ACsupply harmonics are unmasked in the bass and midrangeFig2 Naim Supernait 13octave spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS 16bit data  and 24bit data  and of 24bit dithered tone at –120dBFS  I experimented with the grounding between the Supernait and both of my measurement setups—Stereophiles vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain and a new  we have on loan —and couldnt eliminate this lowlevel hum As the hum occurs at the supply frequency of 60Hz and its odd harmonics rather than at the fullwave–rectified supply frequency of 120Hz I suspect it is due to magnetic coupling from the large toroidal transformer rather than some kind of grounding problem Yes these components are at a very low level but I would rather not have seen them at allDAC linearity error assessed with 24bit data was negligible  and the Naims reproduction of an undithered tone at –9031dBFS was superb with good waveform symmetry and a clean depiction of the three DC voltage levels  Wordclock jitter assessed with the Miller Audio Research Analyzer was quite low at 367 picoseconds peak–peak The spectrum of the Naims output while it reproduced the jitter test signal  was dominated by datarelated sidebands these close to the residual levelFig3 Naim Supernait leftchannel departure from linearity 24bit data Fig4 Naim Supernait

frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHz Turning to the analog domain  and looking at the speakerlevel outputs the Supernaits linelevel inputs gave a maximum gain into 8 ohms of 495dB which is significantly higher than usual for an integrated amplifier The input impedance was a usefully high 64k ohms at 1kHz dropping slightly but inconsequentially at the frequency extremes and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity ie was noninvertingThe output impedance was a little higher than usual for a solidstate design at 03 ohm across most of the audioband As a result the modifications of the amplifiers response by the usual Ohms Law interaction between its output impedance and the impedance of the speaker was a mildly audible ±03dB  Into resistive loads the output rolls off quite quickly above 20kHz resulting in relatively leisurely risetimes on the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  Channel separation  was only moderately good at 70dB or higher below 2kHz while the Supernaits unweighted signalnoise ratio assessed with the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum was compromised by the high gain and by the residual 60Hz hum at 56dB ref 283V into 8 ohms The Aweighted figure was better at 645dB left and 675dB rightFig6 Naim Supernait leftchannel frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8  4  2  ohms Fig7 Naim Supernait smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 4 ohmsFig8 shows how the THDN percentage in the Naims output varies with output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms The downward slope of the traces below 20W indicates that the reading is dominated by noise rather than distortion Defining clipping as 1 THD the Naim more than meets its specified power into 8 ohms at 89Wpc  with both channels driven It clipped at 140Wpc into 4 ohms  but turned off at 141W into 2 ohms to protect itself which is why the trace in fig8 ends at that point Reducing the drive signal allowed the amplifier to turn itself back onFig8 Naim Supernait distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 ohmsFig9 plots how the THDN percentage changed with frequency at 8V equivalent to 8W into 8 ohms  15W into 4 ohms  and 32W into 2 ohms  It stays commendably low at all frequencies partly because the background noise still contributes to the reading At a slightly higher power into 8 ohms  the distortion is primarily the benign second harmonic but still overlaid with noise despite my having averaged 32 separate readings to produce this graphFig9 Naim Supernait leftchannel THDN  vs frequency at 8V into 8  4  2  ohmsFig10 Naim Supernait 1kHz waveform at 18W into 8 ohms  002 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Even at high powers the distortion remained predominantly secondharmonic in nature  The second harmonic in this graph lies at –72dB  and the third at –84dB  But note that the powersupply component at 180Hz is almost as high as the second harmonic especially in the right channel  and that a regular series of offorder powersupply harmonics extends across the spectrum As I conjectured earlier I suspect that this behavior is due to magnetic interference from the toroidal transformer that dominates the Supernaits interior These spuriae can also be seen albeit at a low level in the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it reproduced an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 4 ohms at a level just below visible clipping on the screen of the oscilloscope with which I monitor my measurements  Actual intermodulation is commendably low however with the 1kHz difference component lying at –83dB and the higherorder components at 18kHz and 21kHz at –79dBFig11 Naim Supernait spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 110W into 4 ohms Fig12 Naim Supernait HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms In many ways the Naim Supernait offers excellent measured performance Its DA section is also good and not just an afterthought But the presence of the 60Hz ACsupply components in its output even though they lie at a low level did concern me and the amplifiers ultimate noise performance is compromised to an extent by the higherthannecessary gain
