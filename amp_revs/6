0,I preconditioned one of the Halcro dm88 monoblocks  by running it for 60 minutes at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms With the amplifier cold the measured THDnoise was just 000093 The figure was the same at the end of the hour while the lefthand side panel was gently warm the righthand panel was still cool It wasnt possible to measure the dm88s Current Mode input I performed complete sets of measurements via the dm88s balanced and unbalanced Voltage Mode inputs as well as via its unbalanced Minimal Path jackThe dm88s voltage gain was a higherthanaverage 294dB into 8 ohms via the unbalanced Voltage Mode input unusually it dropped by 6dB to 234dB using the balanced jack The Minimal Path gain was also low at 231dB Both Voltage Mode inputs preserved absolute polarity— ie were noninverting —but the Minimal Path input inverted signal polarity The unbalanced Voltage Mode input impedance was a little higher than usual for a solidstate design ranging from 25k ohms at 20Hz to 22k ohms at 1kHz though it dropped further to 175k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was exactly twice the unbalanced as expected However the Minimal Path input had a very low impedance of 650 ohms across the audioband As well as explaining the slightly lower voltage gain via this input this low input impedance will be incompatible with many preamplifiers especially those using tubed output stagesThe dm88s output impedance was very low across almost all the audioband at 01 ohm including 6 of multistrand speaker cable It rose slightly at 20kHz to 014 ohm though the increase is insignificant As a result any alteration of the amplifiers frequency response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker remained within tight ±01dB limits  The responses shown in this graph were taken via the balanced Voltage Mode jack it is 3dB down at 122kHz into 8 ohms with a slightly earlier ultrasonic rolloff into low impedances The low frequencies are down 05dB at 20HzFig1 Halcro dm88 balanced frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 4 2 ohms The LF response was identical via the unbalanced Voltage Mode input though the ultrasonic response extended a little higher to –3dB at 172kHz  This extended ultrasonic response was the same via the Minimal Path jack but the bass is now flat to below 10Hz  The extended HF response gives rise to an excellent 1kHz squarewave response  and the 10kHz waveform is free from ringing or overshoot Fig2 Halcro dm88 Minimal Path frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms Fig3 Halcro dm88 smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig4 Halcro dm88 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe dm88s noise floor was very low Referenced to a level of 283V into 8 ohms  the Aweighted signalnoise ratio with the input shortcircuited was an extraordinary 1056dB Even the wideband unweighted measurement was 847dB This is an amplifier that can take full advantage of the high resolution promised by SACD and DVDAudioAs expected from its pedigree the dm88 can put out high powers with very low distortion at least into higher impedances Fig5 plots the percentage of THDnoise in the amplifiers output against output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms The downward slope of the traces below 10W in this graph implies that the actual distortion is below the noise floor even with the Halcros very low level of noise in absolute terms Above that power level the amplifiers behavior depends on the load impedance The distortion remains very low into 8 ohms the small discontinuities in the trace indicating that the measurement is at the limit of the Audio Precision System Ones resolving power Into 4 ohms however and even more so into 2 ohms the distortion begins to rise at high powers though still not to any level that might be considered subjectively significant  The amplifier does clip very suddenlyFig5 Halcro dm88 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsThe measured output power at 1 THDN was greater than specified at 295W into 8 ohms  and 525W into 4 ohms  The dm88 is less happy driving 2 ohms however clipping at 266W The low levels of THD at smallsignal levels made it more informative to plot the dm88s THD against frequency at a higherthanusual output voltage where the actual distortion would be above the noise Fig6 shows how the dm88s THD changes into 8 4 and 2 ohms The traces are flat with frequency suggesting that the amplifier has a commendably wide openloop bandwidth However the distortion does increase as the load drops Peculiarly the THD was a little higher at 00017 across the band from the Minimal Path input  Figs7 and 8 reveal that the primary harmonic content is the third and that while this rises in level into low impedances it is not joined by other harmonics Given both the subjectively benign nature of the third harmonic and the very low level of the distortion in absolute terms even into 2 ohms I think it safe to say that the dm88s audible distortion signature will be nonexistentFig6 Halcro dm88 THDN vs frequency at 20V into  8 4 2 ohmsFig7 Halcro dm88 1kHz waveform at 90W into 8 ohms  000093 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Halcro dm88 1kHz waveform at 196W into 4 ohms  00038 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 plots the spectrum of the dm88s output while it drives 50Hz at onethird power into 8 ohms The third harmonic lies at just –106dB  though the second harmonic makes an appearance at –103dB  with this lowfrequency tone  Halving the load impedance didnt affect the secondharmonic level but the third rose to –86dB  as expected from the waveform graphs Intermodulation distortion was very low even at very high powers into 4 ohms  The amplifier didnt misbehave when I drove it into clipping with this very demanding signal Fig9 Halcro dm88 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Fig10 Halcro dm88 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 453W peak into 4 ohms As I have come to expect from Bruce Candy designs the dm88 offers superb measured performance
