0, Hypex Nilai500DIY class D amplifier module with PS500DIY power supply Parts were provided by the company and member Rick Sykora was kind enough to assemble itAs indicated the single channel amplifier is on the left and the power supply on the right The amplifier has builtin preamp providing three levels of gain  A jumper selects the appropriate level At 12 dB you need about 12 volts to reach full power which requires a pro audio interface or a preamp with that level of output The sole input in this configuration is balancedIn use the amplifier was exceptionally solid even when pushed hard It kept going and stayed very cool It is rated to 2 ohm Edit in the original review I had the top open so I could change the gain settings Alas it turns out that doing so allowed some noise pick up around 10 kHz I retested with the lid closed and that issue went away As a results we have slightly better performance especially in highgainHypex Nilai500DIY MeasurementsLets start with lowest gain settingThat is superb performance with distortion at or below 140 dB Here is the response at higher grain settingsWith all thee gain settings the amp lands in our top 20 best amplifiers ever reviewed based on combined noise and distortion rating Noise performance is excellent but just shy of state of the artBut gets there at full powerAs we expect from Hypex frequency response is load impedance independentMultitone performance is excellentAmplifier is stable on power upLets look at available power at 4 ohmLooks like we no longer have to decided between superbly low noise and distortion and available power State of the art performance is once again achieved in low gain while still producing lots of power  Allowing distortion to climb to 1 naturally gives us more power We still have healthy power even with 8 ohm loadSince the amp is rated at 2 ohm I measured that as wellThere is a bit of penalty but still great performance Seems power supply is limiting power so you dont get more juiceI was a bit surprised at the ballooning of the distortion at higher frequenciesEDITThere is more of a noticeable pop on power off than power onAs requested here is the switching responseConclusionsIt is clear Hypex is taking competition in class D amplifiers seriously responding with a DIY friend amplifier solution that has a ton of power and wonderful performance While we could nitpick here and there but in the larger context of the amplifiers out there this is a superb offering of great performance and lots and lots of powerFYI I dont have pricing for the kit If someone has it please post I see online ads saying around 900 to 1100 for a single channelI am happy to add Hypex Nilai500DIY amplifier and its companion PS500DIY power supply to my recommended list As always questions comments recommendations etc are welcomeAny
