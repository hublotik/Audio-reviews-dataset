refurbished upgraded NAD 2200 stereo amplifier It bought member sent QuirkAudio fully updated loaned The work Peter done exemplary The inside looks brand new I repaired hundreds amplifiers never seen one clean So inside components updatedreplaced lot care gone cosmetically clean unit Peter sent long list parts upgraded including reservoir capacitors As result I dont know representative measurements stock units although probably far Used 2200 go US 530 ebayThe front panel nice informative clipping indicatorAs see put amp bridge mode select whether want soft clipping I left see pictureDuring use protection circuit came appropriate nicely reset nothing happenedThe NAD 2200 uses dual voltage rail keep power consumption heat dissipation low producing lower power upping voltage peak power This common technique usually applied low baseline power level Here 100 watts power provided using low voltage power supply rail power higher voltage used Technique worked quite well see later kept amplifier cool happy testingAmplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual start dashboard view 1 kHz tone 4 ohm load 5 wattsNot bad Distortion 100 dB With noise SINAD degrades 93 dB putting 2200 well average nearly 100 amplifiers tested dateNotice gain quite high 32 dB Common range 25 29 dB latter THX standard The higher gain increases noise despite performance good seen High gain makes good fit AVRs example produce distorted output well nominal 2 voltsFrequency response sharp roll seems indicate output direct coupled common todayOr maybe purpose I dont knowCrosstalk goodAs dynamic rangeIt power measurements magic amplifier comes life lets look 4 ohm load firstWe see kink distortion hit 200 watts unit sails past produce whopping 337 watts per channel driven Per design characteristics much momentary peaksWow one kilowatt power coming amp short durationSwitching 8 ohm see similar results 4 ohmSweeping power test 4 ohm different frequencies shows wellbehaved amplifierYou loose power higher frequencies fine since music spectrum lower energy anywayDue long duration test protection circuit likely backed high voltage rail producing lower output levelsEDIT adding Lab Input MeasurementsLab Input MeasurementsI surprised frequency response flat relieved see later thread due insertion low high pass filters So frequency response Lab input doesnt filterResponse ruler flat 10 Hz well extending past 40 kHz limit measurementI figured filters may adding noisedistortion reran dashboard againDistortion doesnt change look noise floor 20 Hz 10 dB That improves SINAD couple dBs making amplifier stand even moreZoomedAnd signal noise ratioConclusionsNice see innovation like equipment 30 years old Shame manufacturers produce amplifiers much less power distortion higher prices days No dont get fancy case sheet metal strictly budget category But going sit amp The guts matters NAD 2200 deliversNOTE output relay stock 2200 gets corroded fails time There videos DIY threads upgrade relay fix problem The unit tested fix Other reports many reliability issues even though NAD products often said less reliable brandsOverall I happy recommend NAD 2200 I almost gave highest honors given upgraded nature test unit fact used amps may issues I avoided But could easily pushed give golfing panther
