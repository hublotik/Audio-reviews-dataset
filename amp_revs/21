0, Fig6 is a spectrum of the dm58s output at 200W into 8 ohms taken with a very linear signal generator the National Instruments NI4451 PCI card that Miller Audio Research uses as one of the platforms for its QC Suite measurement software The second third and fourth harmonics are all between 106dB and 110dB The summed total of the harmonics is around 00008 but even then this is not appreciably higher than the level of the residual harmonics present in the NI cards output   Fig6 Halcro dm58 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC10kHz at 200W into 8 ohms  Given this very low THD it seemed academic to examine the Halcros intermodulation behavior with the Audio Precision System One Nevertheless I include fig7 because it shows that even at the high power level featured in this measurement—220W into 4 ohms just below visible clipping on the scope screen—the only intermodulation products present are those in the output of the DAC used to drive the amplifier  Fig7 Halcro dm58 HF intermodulation spectrum DC24kHz 1920kHz at 220W into 4 ohms  Finally fig8 shows how the percentage of THDnoise present in the dm58s output varied with continuous output power into 8 4 and 2 ohms The constant downward slope with increasing frequency reveals that the measured figure is dominated by noise below the knee of the traces not distortion In addition the slight sawteeth present in the traces due to the Audio Precision System Ones automatic gainranging reveal that the Halcros residual THDN is at the lower limit of what is possible to measure with this setup The actual clipping points  are 260W into 8 ohms  and 490W into 4 ohms  Into 2 ohms the amplifiers protection circuitry cut in at 210W muting the output Into 4 ohms it cut in at 500W  Fig8 Halcro dm58 distortion  vs continuous output power into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Halcros dm58 offers astonishing measured performance for an amplifier particularly when it comes to harmonic and intermodulation distortion Most important this does not appear to have been achieved by compromising other aspects of the amplifiers performance as was the case in the THD Wars of the 1970s
