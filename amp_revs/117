0, Devialet DPremier with Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain  later blackfinish sample serial no00965 the mirrorfinish no00061 having been sent off for photography Before testing an amplifier with a conventional classB or AB output stage I precondition it by running it at onethird power for an hour which thermally stresses the amplifier to the maximum extent In theory this test is irrelevant with the Devialet but I did so anyway At the end of the hour the left side of the top panel was hot to the touch at 1314°F  the right side a little cooler at 1143°F  It might be efficient at converting wall current into speakerdriving power but the DPremier still runs hot As Devialet warns in the DPremiers manual the amplifier needs to be well ventilatedI didnt test the phono inputs performance as I didnt use it during my auditioning for this review The phono stages sound and measured performance will be covered in a FollowUpThe rotary volume control on the Devialets remote control covers a range of –975dB to 300dB in accurate 05dB steps With the control set to 300 the voltage gain into 8 ohms for an analog source and a line input was a high 523dB At 00dB the gain of course was 223dB The analog inputs preserved absolute polarity  and the analog input impedance was moderately low at 14k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly at 20kHz to 125k ohmsDevialet specifies the DPremiers output impedance as 0001 ohm I measured 004 ohm at all audio frequencies but thus includes the impedance of the 6 of speaker cable I used for the test But the fact that the DPremier has an extraordinarily low output impedance can be seen in fig1 where the voltage drop as the load changes from 8 to 4 ohms and the variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker are each less than 01dB Even with a 2 ohm load  the level drops by less than 02dB in the audioband With the DPremier in its standard configuration pressing the middle bottom button on the remote rolls off the low frequencies by 3dB at 20Hz Fig1 was taken with the AD converter that digitizes the analog inputs set to the default of 96kHz sampling As a result the response can be seen to drop like a stone above 40kHz and a 10kHz squarewave has the distinctively rounded shape that is due to the absence of all harmonics above the third  The 1kHz squarewave  has the usual timesymmetrical ringing visible preceding the start of each change in level Fig1 Devialet DPremier analog frequency response with

samplingChannel separation via the analog inputs was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 25kHz  The DPremier is specified as having a superb signalnoise ratio of 130dB but without conditions or reference level given My standard test with an integrated amplifier is to shortcircuit the input but set the volume control to its maximum which is very much the worstcase condition  With its very high gain the DPremier is put at a disadvantage under these conditions  wideband unweighted SN ref 1W into 8 ohms to be a fairly low 471dB in the left channel and 485dB in the right Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these figures to 516 and 523dB respectively while switching in an Aweighting filter gave further improvement to 549 and 552dB Reducing the level of the volume control will improve these ratios of course and fig3 shows the lowfrequency spectrum of the DPremiers output while it reproduced a 1kHz tone at 100W into 8 ohms with the volume control set to 00dB The noise floor is a little higher in the left channel than in the right and rises by 10dB as the frequency decreases The only other thing to note in this graph is the presence of a powersupply–related tone at 120Hz but at –110dB ref the level of the 1kHz tone this is inconsequentialFig3 Devialet DPremier spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms The Devialet is specified as having a maximum output power of 240Wpc into I understand 6 ohms  Fig4 shows how the THDnoise percentage changes with output power into 8 ohms1 The downward slope of the trace below the knee indicates that what distortion is present is actually buried in the noise floor We define clipping as the power when the THD reaches 1 fig4 shows that the DPremier was putting out 180Wpc into 8 ohms  at 1 THD Fig5 shows the behavior into 4 ohms The trace is similar in shape to that into 8 ohms except that very unusually it slopes backward above the knee which occurs at 2458Wpc into 4 ohms  What is happening is that with sustained drive at very high power either the power supply starts to collapse or the DSP protection starts to operate both reducing the power delivery Because of this behavior I didnt test the maximum power into 2 ohmsFig4 Devialet DPremier distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Devialet DPremier distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsI plotted how the output power changes with frequency at a level 20V equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms where the power supply would remain stiff The results are shown in fig6 Below 10kHz the measurement is dominated by noise above that frequency and unlike a conventional classD amplifier there is almost no rise in THD However I havent shown the behavior into 2 ohms as again the powersupply voltage would start to decrease after a few seconds operation at 20VFig6 Devialet DPremier THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms The lower trace in fig7 taken at a level just below the discontinuity in fig4 confirms that actual distortion in the DPremiers output is buried beneath the noise However FFT analysis reveals there to be harmonics present at high powers albeit at a very low level  The two highest in level the second and third harmonics lie at –106dB  and –104dB  respectively with all other harmonics lying at or below –110dB  Conventional classD amplifiers tend to perform poorly when fed highfrequency intermodulation By contrast the DPremier given a mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 20W into 4 ohms  performed well on this test  The 1kHz difference tone lay at almost –110dB and the higherorder intermodulation products were all below –90dB Fig7 Devialet DPremier 1kHz waveform at 150W into 8 ohms  00022 THDN distortion and noise

4 ohms Turning to the DPremiers digital inputs I measured its performance at the speaker outputs as that is how I used the amplifier With the volume control set to 00dB a fullscale 1kHz tone resulted in a level of 3079V into 8 ohms equivalent to a power of 1185Wpc just under 2dB below clipping into this load This suggests that with digital inputs the volume control should be kept below 15dB The digital inputs were again noninverting Although the SPDIF and AESEBU inputs locked on to datastreams with sample rates from 32 to 192kHz including 882 and 1764kHz the AIR WiFi input was restricted to 96kHz and belowFig10 shows the DPremiers frequency response for its digital inputs with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHz Unusually the 192kHz rate gives only a slight increase in bandwidth compared with 96kHz Digital channel separation  was similar to that for analog inputs To remain consistent with the measurements of DAC resolution I have performed since 1989 I used a sweptbandpass technique to generate the traces in fig11 which represent a dithered tone at –90dBFS with 16 and 24bit data Repeating the analysis with a modern FFT technique gave a similar picture  confirming that the only powersupply–related spuriae present was a small amount of 120Hz at –110dB The increase in bit depth from 16 to 24 with both these graphs dropped the noise floor by around 12dB implying a resolution of 18 bits or so which is good if not quite up to the standard set by the bestmeasuring standalone processors such as the Bricasti M1 MSB Diamond DAC IV NAD M51 or Weiss DAC202Fig10 Devialet DPremier

some peculiar scalloping of the noise floor visible with 24bit data in the right channel in fig12  I am not sure what this means Repeating the analysis with 16 and 24bit data over WiFi using the DPremiers AIR input and the Devialet iTunes streamer gave an anomalous result  With 16bit data the 1kHz tone lay at the correct –90dBFS in the left channel  the noise floor lay at the correct level and no harmonics were visible However the right channels noise floor  lay about 5dB higher in level Even more peculiarly sending 24bit data gave only a slight lowering of the noise floor in the left channel  but a raising of the floor in the right channel  I tried rebooting the DPremier by unplugging it from the wall and then powering it back up but this did not restore proper operation with 24bit data This was with v140 of Devialets AIR client I imagine it is something that can be fixed in a future software or firmware releaseFig13 Devialet DPremier FFTderived spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit AIR data  24bit data With SPDIF and AESEBU data the DPremiers reproduction of an undithered sinewave at exactly –9031dBFS was essentially perfect  with undithered 24bit data giving a welldefined sinewave Fig14 Devialet DPremier waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit SPDIF data Fig15 Devialet DPremier waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit SPDIF data Feeding the DPremier a 24bit version of the 441kHz MillerDunn JTest via one of the TosLink inputs gave the spectrum shown in fig16 No datarelated jitter components are visible However a pair of sidebands around the 11025kHz tone at ±120Hz can be seen Although these lie below –120dBFS  and are presumably irrelevant to sound quality they perhaps result from some powersupply interference at the DACs voltagereference pin Repeating the test with Devialet AIR WiFi data gave rise to the same 120Hz sidebands  but now some broadening of the central peak can be seen And as with fig13 the left channels noise floor  is not much lower than the 16bit floor while the right channels floor is significantly higher in level  I suspect that this loss of resolution via WiFi is the reason I ended up preferring using a standalone USBSPDIF converter for the bulk of my auditioning of the DPremierFig16 Devialet DPremier highresolution jitter spectrum of

frequency range ±35kHzOther than its slightly anomalous behavior via WiFi the Devialet DPremiers measured performance is a testament to what can be obtained with switchingamplifier technology However sustained highpower operation into speakers with an impedance of 4 ohms or below is best avoided— John AtkinsonFootnote 1 Because the DPremiers output stage includes a classD element I performed all the distortion measurements using Audio Precisions AUX0025 highpower passive lowpass filter between the amplifiers output and the SYS2722s input But this really didnt appear to be necessary unlike with the classD amplifiers we reviewed in December I could detect no ultrasonic switching noise in the DPremiers output
