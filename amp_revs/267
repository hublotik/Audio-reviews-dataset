0, Behringer NX1000D power amplifier with DSP Cant tell if it is discontinued or not but see it on sale at one place for 299 Retail cost is 549I am a fan of orange displays and NX1000D delivers on that What I am not a fan of pun intended is the super loud fan that stays on all the time I walked away to go to the bathroom and was so surprised that I could hear it from very far distance in the house Unless you can put it in a sealed cabinet I dont see it being useful for hifi use Maybe you can modify it to quiet the fan or make it temperature sensitive On the positive front I really liked the look and feel of the control app that talks to itThe only thing I did not like about it is that it is not clear when some processing is on or off For example above is the peak limiter on or offThe back panel shows SpeakOn connectorsAnd of course combo XLR14 inch balanced inputs You can bridge the two channels although I did not test this configuration The 1000 designation is for total amount of power available As you will see I was not able to come close to that in stereo use with 4 ohm loadBehringer NX1000D MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboardThis is average performance as amplifiers goBut it is good for pro amps SNR falls in the same categoryBest in class amplifiers produce 96 dB at 5 watts and we are pretty shy of that So be mindful of background noise you may get out of your speakers if they are sensitiveFrequency response thankfully is load independent as the company advertises Due to inclusion of DSP though your bandwidth is severely cut to that of 44148 kHz sampling So no high res sampling for youCrosstalk was surprisingly good for the classAs I hinted power delivery into 4 ohm is way under specificationsEven allowing for 1 THD and burst mode we cant get to the company specHow did they get their 300 watt number Using car stereo standardsPower drops quite a bit into 8 ohmJust 78 watts in a pro amplifier This is AVR class amount of power not what you see in this class of product usuallyMultitone test shows distortion increasing at both low and highend of the spectrumWe see the same in our power testing versus frequency and distortionnoiseNotice how the 20 Hz distortion rises unusually what wayConclusionsWe the home users look to pro products to get more wattage on the cheap Behringer unfortunately doesnt give us that here Instead it saddles the product with a loud nontemperature sensitive fan which rules it out of many applications we may have for it So I dont think it is a fit for what most of us want out of an amplifier even though there are some good qualities like load impedance independence DSP low cost etcAs is I cant recommend the Behringer NX1000D
