0, First Watt SIT3     SIT3 by running it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time the top panel was warm at 1063°F  and the heatsinks were hot at 1238°F The First Watts voltage gain into 8 ohms was a very low 113dB and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  The input impedance measured close to the specified 200k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to a still very high 151k ohms at 20kHz The output impedance was half that of the First Watt J2 which Herb Reichert reviewed in October 2016 at 025 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz and 0265 ohm at 20kHz As a result the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±02dB  This graph shows that the audioband response is flat up to 10kHz with a rolloff in the top octave reaching –08dB at 20kHz The SIT3 reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing Fig1 First Watt SIT3 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 First Watt SIT3 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsLike the J2 the SIT3s channel separation was excellent measuring 100dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 74dB at 20kHz The wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio ref 283V and measured with the input shorted to ground was an excellent 873dB in the left channel and an even greater 954dB in the right These ratios improved to 945 and 981dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 107dB when Aweighted These high ratios will be related to the low overall gain of course Spectral analysis of the SIT3s noise floor  revealed spuriae both at 120Hz and its harmonics and at 60Hz and its oddorder harmonics the latter will be due to magnetic interference from the AC power transformer All of these spuriae are very low in level however and will not be audibleFig3 First Watt SIT3 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The SIT3 is specified as being able to deliver 18Wpc into 8 ohms  With clipping defined as when the THDnoise reaches 1 fig4 indicates that the SIT3 clipped at 84Wpc into 8 ohms  Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3 THDN the First Watt clipped at the specified 18Wpc Into 4 ohms  the SIT3 delivered 168Wpc  at 1 THDN and 36Wpc  at 3 Figs 4 and 5 both show that while the distortion is low at very low powers it rises linearly as the power increases This is typical for an amplifier with a singleended output stageFig4 First Watt SIT3 both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 First Watt SIT3 both channels driven distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsThe First Watt SIT3 offered levels of distortion that remained relatively constant with frequency but that increased into lower impedances  Fortunately and as specified by First Watts Nelson Pass  the SIT3s distortion was predominantly the sonically benign second harmonic what appears to be the opposite phase to the fundamental at least regarding the positivegoing half cycles   Though the third harmonic was present at a level around 15dB lower than that of the second  it didnt increase in level as the power increased or the impedance dropped  However higherorder harmonics became visible when the output reached 5W into 8 ohms and above as predicted by Nelson Pass  Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a low power into 8 ohms the levels of higherorder intermodulation products were relatively low  though the secondorder difference product lay at –54dB  Commendably the levels of these intermodulation products were similar when I kept the output voltage the same and halved the load impedance Fig6 First Watt SIT3 THDN  vs frequency at 283V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig7 First Watt SIT3 1kHz waveform at 1Wpc into 8 ohms 0244 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 First Watt SIT3 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms Fig9 First Watt SIT3 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 2Wpc into 4 ohms Fig10 First Watt SIT3 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 5Wpc into 8 ohms Fig11 First Watt SIT3 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms Fig12 First Watt SIT3 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 2Wpc peak into 4 ohms Although that relatively high level of secondharmonic distortion which is a deliberate design choice is controversial the First Watt SIT3 is a wellengineered amplifier Footnote 1 See Gramophone Dreams elsewhere in this issue
