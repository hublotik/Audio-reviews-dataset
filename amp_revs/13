0,A muchtouted benefit of an amplifier with a classD output stage is that it can be smaller and much lighter than a conventional amplifier for a given power I was surprised therefore when I unpacked LKVs Veros PWR to find that it was both large and heavy This is because the amplifier uses a linear power supply with three hefty transformers rather than a switchmode supply  Veros PWR   As the LKV has a classD output stage it wasnt necessary to precondition the amplifier by using it to drive a 1kHz tone at onethird power into 8 ohms Nevertheless before doing any testing I ran it for an hour at a moderate power level following which the top panel was warm at 939°F344°C Because classD amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slewrate limiting all  with an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz Without the filter 218mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the loudspeaker terminalsThe voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 27dB from both the balanced and singleended inputs and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with both inputs The singleended input impedance was a commendably high 165k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to a stillhigh 84k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was more than twice these values at 358k ohms at 20Hz 334k ohms at 1kHz and 268k ohms at 20kHzThe LKVs output impedance including the series impedance of 6 of loudspeaker cable was a very low 007 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz It increased very slightly to 009 ohm at 20kHz The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore negligible at less than ±01dB  The response into resistive loads was flat to 20kHz into 8 ohms but rolled off rapidly above the audioband reaching –3dB at 60kHz  These responses were taken with the balanced inputs the unbalanced inputs behaved identically The restricted ultrasonic response is responsible for slightly lengthened risetimes with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  There is also a small amount of overshoot with the squarewave reproduction with one critically damped cycle of ringing Presumably this is mainly due to the classD output stages integral lowpass

in the L–R direction at 90dB below 3kHz but was up to 20dB worse in the R–L direction Measured with the Audio Precision ultrasonic filter and the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured an excellent 806dB in the left channel and 799dB in the right Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratios to 916dB left and 863dB right and an Aweighting filter increased them further to 948dB left and 915dB right Spectral analysis of the LKV amplifiers lowfrequency noise floor  revealed that spuriae related to the AC powerline frequency were very low in level but were a little higher in the right channel  than the left Fig3 LKV Veros PWR spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Veros PWR is specified as delivering 200Wpc into 8 ohms and 400Wpc into 4 ohms both equivalent to 23dBW At our usual definition of clipping which is when the THDnoise reaches 1 the LKV amplifier with both channels driven exceeded its specified power into 8 ohms clipping at 221Wpc  It clipped at 400Wpc into 4 ohms  and with one channel driven I measured a clipping power of 505W into 2 ohms  This contrasts with the specified maximum 2 ohm power of 220W into 2 ohms  Fig4 LKV Veros PWR distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 LKV Veros PWR distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 LKV Veros PWR distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohmsDistortion levels were very low  but less so in the right channel  than the left channel  even into 2 ohms  However the level of the THD declined above 10kHz perhaps due to the output stages lowpass filter The shape of the THDN spuriae waveform at a moderate power into 8 ohms  suggests that the distortion signature is predominantly thirdharmonic in nature This was confirmed by spectral analysis  though at a moderate power into 4 ohms the third harmonic was higher in the right channel  than it was in the left  Intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones was also very low in level Fig7 LKV Veros PWR THDN  vs frequency at 155V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  and 2 ohms Fig8 LKV Veros PWR 1kHz

performance Footnote 1 See for example Tom Gibbss review of the Bel Canto e1X amplifier in June 2020Footnote 2 In an email Bill Hutchins wrote John noted that the max output power into 2 ohms  contrasts with our spec of 220W into 2 ohms  Because the amps maximum power output is currentlimited into 2 ohms Johns 505W measurement converts to about 250W if both channels are driven with the same sinewave signal Thus his measurement and our spec are in rough agreement
