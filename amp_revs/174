measurements When first product Swiss company NHB108 amplifier Wes Phillips reviewed April 2005 similar measured performance I wrote The NHB108s measured performance indicates exception slightly bent transfer function designer Hervé Delétraz avoided problem commonly associated absence usual overall negativefeedback loop But like earlier design CTH8550 hasnt managed reduce measured aberrations point I could confidently describe inaudible circumstances Which shame given amplifiers beautiful appearance versatile user interface Footnote 1 See Keith Howards article RIAA equalization general
