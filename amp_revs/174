0, darTZeel CTH8550s measured behavior using mainly Stereophiles loaner sample of the topoftheline  system  for some tests I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain s on an amplifier I run it for 60 minutes at onethird its specified power into 8 ohms which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a classB or AB output stage Cold out of the box the darTZeel offered 0083 distortion at onethird power into 8 ohms After 45 minutes of running with both channels driven at this level the THDnoise had increased slightly to 0093 More importantly I cut short the preconditioning at that point as the top panel was too hot to touch and the sidepanels covering the heatsinks were so hot that I was concerned about the amplifier going into thermal runaway Even with no signal the CTH8550s chassis gets very warm after a while—contrary to the manufacturers claim this is definitely not a coolrunning amplifierThe MM phono input of our review sample—Built for THE Show according to the frontpanel display—wasnt activated but it did have an MC phono stage As supplied this offered 547dB of voltage gain at 1kHz measured at the Rec Out jacks and the input impedance was to specification at 1000 ohms across the audioband The RIAA error was commendably low in the audioband with superb channel matching but increased with increasing frequency above 10kHz due to the manufacturer including the socalled Neumann 4th Pole  The darTZeels MC input was quiet with the wideband unweighted SN ratio measuring 516dB ref an input of 500µV at 1kHz It improved to 69dB when Aweighted The phono stages distortion was very low at typically 0025 and the overload margin at low and middle frequencies was superb at 30dB The margin dropped to just 52dB at 20kHz however which is disappointing Fig1 darTZeel CTH8550 MC input RIAA error at 1mV input at 1kHz Turning to the line stage I didnt examine the behavior of the proprietary Zeel and darT inputs and outputs The conventional unbalanced jacks had an input impedance of 42k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to a stillhigh 30k ohms at 20kHz The balanced XLR jacks had an input impedance of 19k ohms across the audioband All the inputs preserved absolute polarity ie were noninverting the XLRs being wired with pin 2 hotMeasured at the speaker terminals the maximum lineinput voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to 12 was 384dB for unbalanced inputs and unusually 6dB lower at 324dB for the balanced input The volume control operated in accurate 05dB steps at 0 the gain at the Preamp Out jacks was 027dB and at 12 it was 1227dB These jacks offered a usefully low output impedance of 80 ohms and again preserved absolute polarityThe CTH8550s output impedance was quite high for a solidstate design at 04 ohms in the bass rising to 05 ohms at 20kHz As a result the modification of its frequency response by the usual Ohms Law interaction between this impedance and the load impedance of our simulated loudspeaker reached ±025dB  which will be audible The smallsignal response into 8 ohms  was flat within the audioband and didnt reach –3dB until 125kHz This wide bandwidth correlated with a wellshaped 10kHz squarewave  and didnt vary significantly with the volume control setting Into increasingly low load impedances however the upper –3dB frequency progressively dropped and the beginning of an infrasonic rise in response became evident Fig2 darTZeel CTH8550 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig3 darTZeel CTH8550 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe CTH8550s channel separation was good rather than great at 78dB in both directions below 1kHz reducing to 65dB at 20kHz This is rather less than the specified 90dB however The background noise level measured with an unbalanced input shortcircuited and the volume control at its maximum setting was –636dB ref 283V into 8 ohms  The Aweighted SN ratio was 872dBA ref the same level which is a little lower than the manufacturers specification of 115dBA ref full powerThe darTZeel comfortably exceeded its maximum power specification This can be seen in fig4 which plots the THDnoise percentage against output power into 8 and 4 ohms with both channels driven and into 2 ohms with one channel driven Defining clipping as 1 THDN the CTH8550 clipped at 230W into 8 ohms  375W into 4 ohms  and 450W into 2 ohms  The distortion starts to rise above the noisefloor at levels of a few hundred milliwatts but was not particularly low The traces in fig5 were taken at a constant 10V into 8 4 and 2 ohms and only really show acceptably low distortion into the higher impedances Ameliorating this behavior to some extent at least will be the fact that the THDN percentage doesnt increase with frequencyFig4 darTZeel CTH8550 distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 2 ohmsFig5 darTZeel CTH8550 THDN vs frequency at 10V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The bottom trace in fig6 shows the waveform of the spuriae the peaks in that waveform occur suspiciously close to the zero crossing points of the sinewave signal  which suggest the presence of crossover distortion Given how hot the amplifier runs which suggests a high output bias current for the output stage this surprised me FFTderived spectral analysis of the amplifiers output at low levels indicates that the dominant harmonics present are the second and third harmonics  which are relatively innocuous subjectively speaking At higher powers however a regular series of higherorder harmonics makes an appearance  and the amplifiers performance on the demanding highfrequency intermodulation test is disappointing Fig6 darTZeel CTH8550 1kHz waveform at 204W into 4 ohms  0206 THDN

into 8 ohms Fig9 darTZeel CTH8550 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 135W peak into 4 ohms Disappointing is the word I would use overall to describe the darTZeels measurements When  first product from this Swiss company the NHB108 amplifier that Wes Phillips reviewed in April 2005 which had a very similar measured performance I wrote that The NHB108s measured performance indicates that with the exception of its slightly bent transfer function designer Hervé Delétraz has avoided the problem most commonly associated with the absence of the usual overall negativefeedback loop But like the earlier design the CTH8550 hasnt managed to reduce the measured aberrations to the point where I could confidently describe them as inaudible under all circumstances Which is a shame given the amplifiers beautiful appearance and versatile user interface Footnote 1 See Keith Howards article on the RIAA equalization in general and this subject in particular in the March 2009 issue
