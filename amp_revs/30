0,I began to perform a full suite of measurements on the PS Audio BHK Signature 300    First however  amplifier by running it at onethird the specified power 100W into 8 ohms for 60 minutes At the end of that time its top panel was warm and its heatsinks were hot at 1221°F  The percentage of THDnoise at this power level was 00145 with the amplifier cold 00164 with it fully warmed upThe BHK 300s voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was a little higher than usual at 305dB with both balanced and unbalanced input signals Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  and the singleended input impedance was 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies decreasing slightly and inconsequentially to 39k ohms at the top of the audioband The balanced input impedance was exactly twice these values as expected The output impedance  was on the high side for a solidstate amplifier at 016 ohm at all audio frequenciesAfter that point having been powered up for two hours the BHK 300 became unstable Both with signal present and with the input shorted to ground there was a tone at 270kHz present at the output at a level of 3V The frontpanel light remained illuminated  I put the amplifier into standby with its frontpanel button then turned it off with the rearpanel switch When I turned it on again and let it go through its turnon routine it worked fine for about a minute operating with a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms with very low distortion after which the ultrasonic noise reappeared I turned the amplifier off again after which it wouldnt turn on at allI redid all of the testing with serial no 5G0063 This sample performed without any problems and matched no 5G0062 very closely at least with the tests Id performed up to the point where I had the problemThe gray trace in fig1 shows the BHK 300s smallsignal frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker The variations in response were just ±015dB and into resistive loads the amplifier had a wide bandwidth with –3dB frequencies of 195kHz into 8 ohms  175kHz into 4 ohms  and 100kHz into 2 ohms  With this wide bandwidth it came as no surprise that the BHK 300s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  featured very short risetimes though the slightest hint of overshoot is visibleFig1 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio  was good measuring 822dB  This ratio improved to 867dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband and 902dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the lowfrequency noise floor while the BHK 300 drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms revealed a regular series of ACrelated spuriae  though these were all very low in levelFig3 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The PS Audio comfortably exceeded its specified power outputs of 300W into 8 ohms and 600W into 4 ohms  clipping at 370W into 8 ohms  and 620W into 4 ohms  The BHK 300 clipped at 950W into 2 ohms but was less comfortable at lower powers into this low an impedance This can be seen in fig6 which plots the percentage of THDnoise into 8 4 and 2 ohms at a level 8975V  at which I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise The THD was very low at low and middle frequencies into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  but rose into 2 ohms  and in the top two audio octavesFig4 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 THDN  vs frequency at 8975V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The distortion signature was predominantly the relatively benign third harmonic in nature  which was low in level even at high powers lying at –80dB  into 8 ohms  Reducing the load to 4 ohms at this output level  brought up the fifth and seventh harmonics a little  but the third harmonic didnt increase Despite the decreasing linearity at high frequencies seen in fig6 the BHK Signature 300 did very well when asked to handle an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level a few dB below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen Even into 4 ohms  the 1kHz difference product lay at –107dB  and the higherorder products at 18 and 21kHz were still almost 80dB down from the peak signal levelFig7 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 1kHz waveform at 60W into 4 ohms 0025 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms Fig9 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 200W into 4 ohms Fig10 PS Audio BHK Signature 300 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms Amplifiers do tend to break when I set them up on the test bench—its the audio equivalent of taking a car out on the skid pad to find out at what lateral gforce it rolls over—so I give PS Audios BHK Signature 300 the benefit of the doubt Its measured performance indicates that it is a welldesigned wellengineered powerhouse of an amplifier though it will perform at its best with speakers having an impedance of 4 ohms and above
