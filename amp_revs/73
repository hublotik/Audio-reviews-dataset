0,As Bel Canto Designs Black is a complex product—both the ASC1 control unit and MPS1 monoblocks have both digital and analog inputs—I performed most of my measurements with the control unit and amplifiers connected with the SToptical datalinks with checks of the analog inputs of the amplifiers  Black using the digital and analog outputs of my  system  and my 2012 MacBook Pro running on battery power to feed the USB input Because the MPS1 is a classD design I used an Audio Precision AUX0025 passive lowpass filter ahead of the analyzer which eliminates noise above 200kHz  After an hour of running at moderate power levels into 8 ohms the chassis of the two MPS1s were warm to the touch at 946°F I didnt test the Ethernet input but all the ASC1s other digital inputs locked to data with sample rates ranging from 441 to 192kHz Apples USB Prober utility identified the Black as Bel Canto uLinkUSB 20 Audio Out and confirmed that the USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode Measured at the MPS1s speaker terminals the ASC1s digital inputs preserved absolute polarity and with the volume control set to 100 data with a level of –20dBFS gave rise to an analog signal of 1208V RMS into 8 ohms This suggests that the volume control shouldnt be used above 94 to avoid clipping the amplifiers The control itself operated in accurate 05dB stepsThe Blacks reconstruction filter offers three different rolloffs as well as a setting called Filter Off Fig1 shows the impulse response at a sample rate of 441kHz with Filter Off this is a conventional linearphase halfband impulse response with the ringing symmetrically placed around the single sample at 0dBFS By contrast Filters 1–3 offer minimumphase impulse responses with  all the ringing following the high sample and the amount of ringing decreasing as the number of the filter increases Fig2 for example shows the impulse response of Filter 2Fig1 Bel Canto Black digital input Filter Off impulse response at 441kHz Fig2 Bel Canto Black digital input Filter 2 impulse response at 441kHz White noise sampled at 441kHz reveals that the Filter Off filter has the usual fast rolloff above the audioband  with a small rise in the ultrasonic noise floor centered on 65kHz  Bel Canto claims that Filters 1–3 are apodizing types meaning that they eliminate ringing at half the sample rate The red and magenta traces in fig4 show the Blacks output with Filter 1 selected You can see that it is indeed an apodizing type by the sharply defined null at exactly half the sample rate  Filters 2 and 3 are identical other than the fact that the rolloff starts a little earlier and the height of the lobe in the stopband above the green line is lower in amplitude The blue and cyan traces in these graphs are the output with a fullscale tone at 191kHz all four filters completely suppress the ultrasonic image at 25kHz and the distortion harmonics are all at or below –76dB Fig3 Bel Canto Black digital input Filter Off wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig4 Bel Canto Black digital input Filter 1 wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig5 is a more conventional way of showing digital frequency response with Filter 1 and sample rates of 441 96 and 192kHz The overall shape of the response is the same at all three rates with as expected a sharp rolloff at 20kHz at 441kHz But the ultrasonic rolloff occurs a little earlier with the higher rate With 192kHz data for example the output is down by 9dB at 52kHz rather than at the expected 90kHz or so This measurement was taken at the speaker terminals so it includes the contribution of the classD modules and of course the Audio Precision lowpass filter However repeating the measurements without the AP filter or with an analog input to the MPS1 gave the same result The classD stage has of necessity a curtailed ultrasonic response due to the fact that it cannot have an infinitely high switching frequency so while the full bandwidth extension offered by high sample rates cant be realized with the Black it looks as if Bel Cantos design team has achieved a careful balance of what is possible Filters 2 and 3 offer earlier rolloffs with 441kHz data trading off the slight loss of topoctave response against the better timedomain behavior of these filtersFig5 Bel Canto Black digital input frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  To test the resolution of the Blacks digital inputs I set the volume control to 90 equivalent to an output power of 165W into 8 ohms Under this condition increasing the bit depth from 16 to 24 with dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS dropped the noise floor by 23dB  which is equivalent to a resolution of almost 20 bits superb performance Referenced to the Blacks specified clipping power this would increase to 21 bits though I didnt test that due to my concern that I might inadvertently break the amplifier before I finished the measurements This graph was taken with AESEBU data repeating the test with USB data gave the same result indicating that the USB input correctly handles 24bit data With its superb lowlevel linearity and low noise the Bel Canto had no problem dealing with an undithered 16bit tone at exactly –9031dBFS  The data describe three DC voltage levels these were clearly evident and the waveform was nicely symmetrical about the time axis With undithered 24bit data the result was a clean sinewave relatively free of noise Fig6 Bel Canto Black digital input spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Fig7 Bel Canto

rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit JTest data  the Black produced no visible jitterrelated sidebands and the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were all close to the correct levels  This graph was taken with AESEBU data USB data gave an identical result and with 24bit data the noise floor was clean and free from spuriae Fig9 Bel Canto Black digital input

 Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHzTurning to the Bel Canto Blacks performance with analog signals these are digitized by the ASC1 As the ASC1 has AESEBU outputs as well as the SToptical outputs to feed the MPS1s I could examine the efficacy of its digitization by looking at the digital data directly The ASC1s AD converter operates at a sample rate of 192kHz and a 24bit word length The maximum volume control setting was 110 with settings above 100 applying gain in the digital domain At this setting it took an 830mV signal at 1kHz to reach –01dBFS Reducing the volume appears to increase the digital headroom Fig11 shows the ASC1s analoginput frequency response measured in the digital domain The output is down by 3dB at 53kHz the fairly slow rolloff suggesting good timedomain behaviorFig11 Bel Canto ASC1 analog input AD frequency response  The ASC1s singleended analog input impedance was 9k ohms at all audio frequencies this a little on the low side for use with tubed source components The MPS1s balanced analog input impedance was 18k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping to 2300 ohms at 20kHz Both components analog inputs preserved absolute polarity  at the factory default setting The MPS1s audioband output impedance was very low at 009 ohm  As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response due to the interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was minuscule  The data plotted in this graph indicate that the MPS1s response is down by 1dB at 20kHz –3dB at 31kHz and –9dB at 50kHz This ultrasonic rolloff was the same driving the ASC1s analog input and measuring at the MPS1s speaker terminal nor did it change with different settings of the ASC1s volume controlFig12 Bel Canto MPS1 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig13 shows the Blacks reproduction of a smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms The tops and bottoms of the waveform are obscured by the ultrasonic switching noise generated by the classD output stage Repeating the measurement with the Audio Precision lowpass filter ahead of the analyzer gave the wellshaped waveform in fig14 I suspect that the small amount of overshoot and ultrasonic ringing is due to the ASC1s AD converter A 10kHz squarewave  was reproduced with just one cycle of ringing and lengthened risetimes associated with the ultrasonic rolloff seen in fig12 Even with the Audio Precision filters rolloff there is enough leakage of the output stages switching noise to interfere with both the unweighted wideband and audioband signalnoise ratios The Aweighted SN ratio of the MPS1 alone taken with the analog input shorted to ground and ref 283V into 8 ohms was 792dB that of the complete Black with its analog input shorted but its volume control set to 110 was 602dB Channel separation measured at the ASC1s analog inputs was 100dB below 2kHz and still 70dB in both directions at 20kHzFig13 Bel Canto Black smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig14 Bel Canto Black smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision lowpass filterFig15 Bel Canto Black smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision lowpass filter MPS1s clipping power by driving it directly to avoid the possibility of overdriving the ASC1s analog input AD converter and confusing the result The Black is specified as delivering 300W into 8 ohms 600W into 4 ohms or 1200W into 2 ohms all equivalent to 248dBW However in this continuously driven condition the amplifiers protection circuit operated at a level 3dB below the specified maximum power This can be seen in figs 16 and 17 which respectively plot the THDnoise percentage against output power into 8 and 4 ohms The traces stop at 1495W into 8 ohms  at 000223 THDN and at 293W into 4 ohms  at 0002 which in both cases was where the protection circuit went into action Into 2 ohms  the protection cut in at 545W  at 0015Fig16 Bel Canto Black distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig17 Bel Canto Black distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsBut below the continuous powers where the protection operated the MPS1 offered very low distortion The lower trace in fig18 shows the distortionnoise waveform at 59W into 4 ohms I had to average 64 captures to reduce the noise to the point where the distortion waveform emerged from the higherlevel noise it is primarily thirdharmonic in nature This was with the review unit designated as the left channel As can be seen in fig19 the other sample  had just a trace of secondharmonic distortion Intermodulation distortion at a fairly high power was also very low  the 1kHz difference component resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at –96dB Fig18 Bel Canto Black 1kHz waveform at 59W into 4 ohms 0005 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig19 Bel Canto Black spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 86W into 4 ohms Fig20 Bel Canto Black HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 86W peak into 4 ohms Overall I was very impressed by the Bel Canto Black especially with its behavior as a DA converter that is effectively capable of driving loudspeakers Once I have finished the review of another amplifier I have been working on I am going to set up the Black in my own system for a listen Footnote 1 This test was suggested to me by Jürgen Reis of MBL
