0, Gryphon Essence    amplifier by operating it with classAB outputstage bias at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour At the end of that time the top panels temperature was 883°F  and that of the sidemounted heatsinks 904°F  Repeating the preconditioning with classA bias after letting the amplifier cool down resulted in a slightly higher heatsink temperature 921°F  The Essence monoblock easily has sufficient heatsink capacity for its output powerThe Gryphons voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 307dB with both outputstage bias conditions and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  the XLR input jack being wired with its pin 2 positive The input impedance was close to 10k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz Though this is half the specified 20k ohms it is still sufficiently high not to cause compatibility problems with tube preamplifiersThe Gryphons output impedance in classA was higher than the specified 0015 ohms at 026 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz and 028 ohm at 20kHz  The output impedance was slightly higher in classAB at 029 ohms at 1kHz Nevertheless the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was small at ±02dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  was flat to 20kHz and down by 3dB at 170kHz which correlates with the Essences superb reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  Commendably there was no overshoot or ringing with the squarewave response Into 2 ohms  the response was –02dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 90kHzFig1 Gryphon Essence frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Gryphon Essence smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsMeasured with the input shorted to ground the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was an excellent 865dB ref 1W into 8 ohms this ratio improving to 959dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband and to 1008dB when Aweighted This is a quiet amplifier Spuriae at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its harmonics were very low in level but varied with the outputstage bias The spuriae at 60Hz and 180Hz were highest in level with classA bias at –104dB and –110dB ref 1W into 8 ohms  and were even lower in level with classAB bias Fig3 Gryphon Essence spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms with classA bias  and classAB  The Essences manual specifies the amplifiers maximum power as 55W into 8 ohms 110W into 4 ohms and 220W into 2 ohms all equivalent to 174dBW  Using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the Gryphon didnt quite meet its specified powers clipping with a 1kHz signal at 53W into 8 ohms  with both classA bias  and classAB bias  In both bias conditions the THDN was very low at powers of a few watts Into 4 ohms the Essence clipped at 101W  but the THDN was lower at low powers with classA bias  than with classAB bias  The Essence didnt quite meet its specified power into 2 ohms clipping at 182W  However it is relevant to note that I dont hold the AC wall voltage constant when I test an amplifiers clipping powerFig4 Gryphon Essence

into 8 ohms 40W into 4 ohms and 80W into 2 ohms which are all approximately 4dB below the clipping powers into these loads The THDN was very low in the midrange into 8 and 4 ohms with both classA bias  and classAB bias  but rose into 2 ohms  There is the usual increase in THDN in the top audio octaves due to the circuits limited openloop bandwidth Fig10 Gryphon Essence classA bias THDN  vs

predominantly an equal mix of the subjectively benign second and third harmonics  each lying at –73dB  ref 20W into 8 ohms Higher harmonics are all much lower in level With classAB bias the second harmonic was the highest in level at the same –73dB  but there were now more higherorder harmonics present When the Essence drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 20W into 8 ohms  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay just above –80dB  in both bias conditions with higherorder intermodulation products a little higher in level at –70dB Fig12 Gryphon Essence classA
