0, Crown DCI 4  300N four channel DSP and networked professional amplifier It was kindly purchased  and sent to me for testing and costs US 3511There is only a power onoff on the front I wish there was a processing bypass as well The full capability is visible on the backI wouldnt be able to scratch the surfaces of all that this amplifier can do Suffice it to say you can do full processing  environmentremote control and transmission of digital audio over Ethernet type cabling Configuration is available using Audio Architect software Typical of these Pro applications it takes a bit of effort to get used to its operation but after that it seemed easy enough to useA rather loud fan turns on during power on testing and then goes off Alas during my testing it came back on Unless the amplifier is way away from your listening spot better plan to put it in another roomdedicate closetConnections are all through screw terminals Not so bad for speakers but for balancedunbalanced input you are going to need to have bare wires  Not the end of the world but dont expect to buy and power on the same day if you dont have these bitsI was disappointed with the trim controls in the back They are very coarse and hard to adjust to an exact value And being on the rear makes it harder to manipulate For its intended application of professional installation is not a big deal but for oneoff testinguse is more workI chose to test channels 3  4 as my standard setup is stereo During use the amplifier case did not rise above ambient but again the fan was running the whole timeNote our company Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and we move probably more Crown amplifier than any system integrated on the west coast So feel free to read bias into my subjective remarksCrown 4300N Amplifier MeasurementsUpon power on output noisedistortion was quite stable which is niceSo on to our 1 kHz dashboard  5 watts into 4 ohm loadI must say I expected much worse performance Distortion is below 100 dB and SINAD as a result is dominated by noise As is performance is a bit above average of many amplifiers tested to dateAs noted noise floor is somewhat high causing SNR at 5 watt to be below desirable level Using default settings  this is our frequency responseI was surprised to see the response not being flatter at 4 ohm Still we are talking about less than 05 dB Importantly there is slight change with load change to 8 ohm indicating small amount of load dependency Multitone yet again displays the low levels of distortionCrosstalk is better than most amplifiers I measureWe have healthy amount of power into 4 ohmAnd get even more when we allow 1 THDNSwitching to 8 ohm load we naturally get less but there is still good bit of power on tapI was disappointed to see distortion rise though above 1 kHz as power increasedOn the positive front there is not much impact at 20 Hz so you can comfortably use the amp to power subs and suchFinally turn on and off behavior is very goodDo notice the long time to turn on though ConclusionsNice to see that as we go up in price performance of a pro amplifier improves as well No it is not state of the art but this combination of four channels with sophisticated DSP and audio streaming is not easy to find in consumer domainI am going to put Crown 4  300N amplifier on my recommended list
