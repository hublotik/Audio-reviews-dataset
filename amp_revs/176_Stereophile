My review sample PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP fitted EL34 output tubes—I made sure bias correctly set tubes performing testing After allowing DiaLogue Premium HP warm hour I used system examine measured performance With 4 8 ohm outputtransformer taps choice triode ultralinear operation DiaLogue Premium HP four amplifiers one I looked four output conditionsThe lowest maximum gain triode mode
