0,Because of the Boulder 2150s bulk and weight—319 lbs in its shipping crate—I wouldnt have been able to get it down the stairs to my test lab much less back up those stairs So I packed up my  system  and the PC I use to control it along with analog and digital oscilloscopes test loads and all the cables I would need and drove to Michael Fremers lair in deepest darkest New JerseyThere I had a couple of problems Usually before doing any testing of a power amplifier I precondition it by running it at onethird power into 8 ohms for an hour  However onethird of the Boulders specified maximum power of 1000W is 333W and I dont have a test load that could handle that power level for an hour without overheating Therefore I wasnt able to precondition the 2150 before testing itMy second problem too was related to the 2150s power The only practical place to perform the measurements was in Mikeys garage which adjoins his house However the only electrical outlets within reach of the long extension cords Id brought with me were on a 15A circuit  While this allowed me to test the amplifiers distortion and clipping power into 8 and 4 ohms the circuit breaker tripped at powers above 800W into 2 ohms which is well below the specified maximum power of 4000W into this loadThe Boulder 2150s voltage gain into 8 ohms was 259dB a little below the norm but conforming to the specified 26dB The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with pin 2 of the XLR jack wired as hot  The input impedance at 20Hz and 1kHz was 194k ohms which is close to the specified 200k ohms and at 20kHz dropped inconsequentially to 130k ohms The output impedance including 6 of speaker cable was extremely low at 002 ohm at low and middle frequencies this rose only slightly to 0026 ohm at the top of the audioband As a result the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  was virtually nonexistent The frequency response into resistive loads was flat in the audioband and down by just over 3dB at 200kHz  The Boulders reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured short risetimes and was free from any overshoot or ringing Fig1 Boulder 2150 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Boulder 2150 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe 2150 was extremely quiet—its unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio with the input shorted to ground measured 785dB ref 283V into 8 ohms This improved to 943dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 97dB when Aweighted Spectral analysis of the Boulders noise floor while it reproduced a 1kHz tone into 8 ohms  indicated that the only powersupply–related spuriae were all very low in level and primarily comprised the 60Hz AC frequency and its third and fifth harmonics all of which were close to or below –110dB  This spectrum was not affected when I experimented with the grounding between the Boulder and the test systemFig3 Boulder 2150 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Not only was the Boulder 2150 quiet it offered very low distortion and very high power Fig4 plots the percentage of THDnoise against output power into 8 ohms The downward slope of the trace below 200W or so indicates that whatever distortion is present lies below the noise The 2150 clips sharply reaching 1 THDN at 960W  This is 02dB lower than the specified 1000W  but this is most likely due to the fact that I didnt hold the wall voltage constant during this test Fig5 is a similar graph for 4 ohms The 2150 clips at 1450W into this load  but again note that I didnt hold the wall voltage constantFig4 Boulder 2150 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Boulder 2150 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsNot only was the Boulders distortion very low into 8 ohms it hardly changed with frequency even at 40V  There was a rise at higher frequencies at this same level into 4 ohms  but to no higher than 0004 And at 1kHz at 40V into 4 ohms the distortion waveform was mainly noise with the faintest hint of third harmonic  Spectral analysis  indicates that the third harmonic at this level lies at –119dB  which is about the same level as the third harmonic of the AC supply frequency Intermodulation distortion is also extraordinarily low Fig6 Boulder 2150 THDN  vs frequency at 40V into 8 ohms  4 ohms Fig7 Boulder 2150 1kHz waveform at 400W into 4 ohms 000036 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig8 Boulder 2150 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–20kHz at 400W into 4 ohms Fig9 Boulder 2150 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 200W peak into 8 ohms Boulders 2150 is an extraordinary amplifier It measured so well that it taxed the capabilities of my   Footnote 1 The SYS2722 has been superseded by the higherperformance APx555 but its going to be a while before I can afford to buy one
