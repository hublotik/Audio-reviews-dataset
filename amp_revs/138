0, Simaudio Moon i33 I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the topoftheline  system  Before I did any testing of the Moon i33 I ran it at 33Wpc into 8 ohms for an hour This power level  imposes the maximum heat stress on an amplifier with a classAB output stage and at the end of the hour the Simaudios heatsinks were way too hot to touch and its top plate was around 140°F  You should make sure that this amplifier is in a wellventilated position The THDnoise at this power level with the amplifier stone cold was 0025 after 60 minutes it had risen to 005 but the amplifier seemed otherwise fineAlthough Erick Lichte didnt use it the review sample of the i33 was fitted with the optional phono stage  a small daughterboard at the right rear of the chassis Internal jumpers allow this to be set to MM or MC modes for the input impedance to be set to 100 or 47k ohms and for the input capacitance to be switched between 0 and 100pF The phonostage gain measured at the fixed linelevel output was approximately 55dB higher than the specified figures of 40 and 60dB  but this appeared to be due to the fact that the level from this output for linelevel signals was 57dB higher than unity Both MM and MC settings preserved absolute polarity  and the input impedances at 1kHz were close to specification at 49k ohms  and 101 ohms  These impedances varied only slightly at different frequenciesFig1 shows the departure of the RIAA equalization from true accuracy The treble is shelved up by 04dB and the right channel is 025dB higher in level than the left but otherwise the channels match closely The i33s phono board incorporates the IECrecommended lowfrequency rolloff and the output rolls off sharply above 40kHz The phono stage was pretty quiet for such an inexpensive option The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was excellent at 768dB  and 62dB  measured at the fixed outputs with the input shorted and referenced to 1kHz at 5mV and 500µV respectively Aweighting the measurements gave 885 and 65dB The overload margins were also excellent at 29dB at 20Hz and 26dB at 1kHz in both modes The 20kHz margin was less good however at approximately 7dB Stephen Mejias will be writing a FollowUp review on this phono stageFig1 Simaudio Moon i33 phono input response with RIAA correction  Moving on to the amplifiers performance from its line inputs these also preserved absolute polarity and offered an unbalanced input impedance of the specified 11k ohms at low and midrange frequencies this dropping to 7k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was twice these figures as expected The output impedance from the variable preamp jacks was a low 100 ohms Measured at the speaker jacks the i33 preserved absolute polarity and offered a sensible maximum gain of 353dB into 8 ohms for both the regular unbalanced inputs and the optional balanced outputsThe output impedance was a very low 006 ohm over most of the audioband rising to just 009 ohm at 20kHz As a result the variation in frequency response with our simulated loudspeaker  was minimal This graph also shows that the i33 has an extended highfrequency response the –3dB point lying at 90kHz Commendably this was not affected by the volumecontrol setting and the 10kHz squarewave response featured very low risetimes  and the 1kHz squarewave was beautifully square Fig2 Simaudio Moon i33 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig3 Simaudio Moon i33 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig4 Simaudio Moon i33 smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was good at 80dB in both directions below 7kHz and the wideband unweighted SN ratio  was a good 71dB ref 1W into 8 ohms improving to 75dB when AweightedThe background noise limited the THDN measurement at low power levels but the true distortion began to emerge from the noise floor at around 10W into 8 ohms and 30W into 4 ohms  This graph also shows that even with both channels driven the Simaudio comfortably exceeds its specified maximum power the 1 THDN limit being reached at 130Wpc into 8 ohms  and 210Wpc into 4 ohms  I plotted the THDN percentage against frequency at 9V  and you can see in fig6 that while the distortion starts to rise in the top two octaves particularly in the right channel it remains low in absolute termsFig5 Simaudio Moon i33 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  8 4 ohmsFig6 Simaudio Moon i33 THDN  vs frequency at 9V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The distortion is strongly thirdharmonic in nature  which will be relatively benign in subjective terms However spectral analysis of the amplifiers output driving a highpower lowfrequency tone into 4 ohms  reveals that as well as some other loworder spuriae accompanying the third harmonic spectral components are present at the odd harmonics of the 60Hz AC mains frequency I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision test set but couldnt eliminate the spuriae Though there is some 120Hz content present which is the frequency of the raw fullwaverectified supply this is low in level at –109dB and –104dB left and right channels respectively The presence of oddorder harmonics of the 60Hz frequency suggests that these result from magnetic interference from the humongous toroidal transformer that occupies half the amplifiers internal real estate So even though the amplifier performs well on the highfrequency intermodulation test with low levels of loworder intermodulation products  the noise floor is marred by the 60Hz harmonics It is fair to point out however that these drop to below –120dB above 25kHz even in the noisier right channelFig7 Simaudio Moon i33 1kHz waveform at 10W into 4 ohms  002 THDN

1920kHz at 60W peak into 8 ohms Turning to the Moon i33s performance as a DA converter I measured its behavior at the fixed outputs with the volume control set to its minimum to avoid stressing the poweramplifier section The USB input uses the ubiquitous BurrBrown PCM2705 receiver chip which is limited to sample rates of 48kHz and below and to 16bit data The SPDIF inputs successfully locked to data with sample rates ranging from 32 to 192kHz though with the AP SYS2722s digital output the i33s frontpanel display stubbornly said 441kHz regardless of the actual sample rate It did display the correct sample rate with the digital output of the RME soundcard fitted to one of my lab PCs however and it appears that not all digital sources include the necessary metadata for the i33 to correctly display the sample rate Simaudio will have a userconfigurable firmware update for this by the time you read this review In the meantime it is important to note that the DA board does correctly decode data regardless of the sample rate This can be seen in fig10 which shows the frequency response with data sampled at 441 96 and 192kHzFig10 Simaudio Moon i33 frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 441kHz  96kHz  192kHz  With my usual test for DAC resolution in which I sweep a 13octave bandpass filter from 20kHz to 20Hz while the device under test decodes dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS increasing the word length from 16 to 24 bits drops the noise floor by around 10dB  This suggest that the i33s digital board which uses the 24bit PCM1793 DAC chip from BurrBrown actually achieves closer to 18bit performance This is not quite good enough to resolve a tone at –120dBFS  The 60Hzrelated spuriae can also be seen in this graph as well as in FFTderived spectra of the same –90dBFS data Fig11 Simaudio Moon i33 13octave spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  and 24bit data  and of dithered tone at

decoding undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS which should consist of three DC voltage levels  Increasing the bit depth gave a good if rather noisy representation of a sinewave  and linearity error with 16bit data was negligible down to below –105dBFS  The Moons DA circuitry featured low distortion the only harmonics accompanying a fullscale tone being the second and third both at –100dBFS Fig13 Simaudio Moon i33 waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data Fig14 Simaudio Moon i33 waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 24bit data Fig15

interface jitter with the Miller Analyzer measuring 575 picoseconds peak–peak This primarily comprises datarelated sidebands at ±229Hz  Though the USB connection is not susceptible to interface jitter performing a similar analysis with the same signal sourced from my MacBook revealed a rather messylooking spectrum  with sidebands present at 595ps p–p The spectral peak representing the 11025kHz tone is noticeably broadened at its base compared with fig17 due to the presence of lowfrequency random timing errorsFig17 Simaudio Moon i33 highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz

analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit data from MacBook via USB Center frequency of trace 11025kHz frequency range ±35kHz Simaudios Moon i33 offers usefully high power in an attractively small package though its use of a largerthannormal AC transformer does somewhat pollute its noise floor The optional phono stage measures well despite its low cost The optional digital board offers good rather than great performance I am not surprised that EL preferred the sound of the external CEntrance DACport which is a bit of an overachiever for the same price as the Simaudio board
