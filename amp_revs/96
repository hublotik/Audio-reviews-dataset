0,As mentioned by Wes Phillips its generous output stage bias causes the NHB108 to run hot After the preconditioning period of running at onethird power into 8 ohms its chassis and heatsink were very hot The amplifier is very fussy about how it is used Turning it on without a load attached blows the 63A fastblo fuses as does unplugging an input jack Several times during the testing I inadvertently blew fuses and got quite proficient in replacing them even though the fuseholders are hard to reach and manipulate given their placement inside the chassis adjacent to each power transformerUnusually there were DC offsets present on the review samples output terminals With the NHB108s input shortcircuited I measured 985mV on the left channel 115mV on the right The manufacturer handtrims each amplifier before shipping as this sample had seen a lot of travel over the past two years its possible that its DC operating points had gone out of alignment I did a complete set of measurements with the NHB108 set to its Hi condition with some followups set to Lo The voltage gain at the Hi and Lo settings was 263dB into 8 ohms absolutely normal and the amplifier was noninverting ie it preserved absolute polarity The XLR jacks on this sample input were simply connected in parallel with the unbalanced RCA jacks current production Im told has true transformercoupled balanced inputs in addition to the unbalanced and 50 ohm Zeel inputs The RCA jacks offered a higherthanspecified input impedance at 220k ohms at 1kHz dropping to 110k ohms at 20kHz  As a result the NHB108 will not load down preamplifiersThe NHB108 lacks overall negative feedback According to the designer the only feedback in the input stage is degenerative  while the output stage is full openloop with no feedback at all no emitter resistor no serial inductance whatsoever A small local symmetrical feedback is wrapped around the middle second stage but there is no feedback path from the output to the input Amplifiers lacking overall loop negative feedback can have high output impedances However the NHB108 measured quite well in this regard the source impedance remaining around 034 ohm across the audioband As a result the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms Law interaction between its source impedance and the impedance of our simulated loudspeaker load  stayed within respectable ±03dB limitsFig1 darTZeel NHB108 frequency response at 283V into  simulated loudspeaker load 8 ohms 4 ohms Into resistive loads the measured smallsignal response  revealed a very wide bandwidth with the amplifiers output down by just 1dB at 148kHz  As a result the NHB108s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was superb with small risetimes and an absence of overshoot and ringing Fig2 darTZeel NHB108 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsOne thing I noted during the measurements was that after an abrupt change in load impedance the amplifiers output level continued changing very slightly settling asymptotically on its new steadystate value I also noticed this phenomenon with Ayres AX7 amplifier  which resembles the darTZeel in not having an overall feedback loopThe darTZeels channel separation was excellent at 95dB L–R and 100dB R–L But this is still a higher level of crosstalk than I was expecting from the amplifiers physically dualmono construction  Perhaps the need with this earlyproduction sample to connect the two channels speaker ground terminals introduces some small degree of crosstalk One reason I could see this low level of crosstalk on my oscilloscope screen was because the NHB108s noise floor was superbly low Referenced to an output level of 1W into 8 ohms the Aweighted signalnoise ratio was 914dB Even with a wideband unweighted measurement the SN was 765dBAgain due to its lack of loop negative feedback the NHB108 is not a lowdistortion design Fig3 plots the level of THD and noise present in its output  as the output power rises from 100mW to clipping  into 8 4 and 2 ohms The distortion level at low powers is relatively high and almost doubles with each halving of the load impedance Even so the amplifiers linearity remains reasonably constant over a wide range of output power meaning that the circuits operating conditions will not be modulated by the signal Clipping occurs quite abruptly but the amplifier easily exceeds its specified 100Wpc20dBW output power I measured 160W into 8 ohms  230W into 4 ohms  but 162W into 2 ohms  The manufacturer strongly recommends using the Lo setting if the amplifier is to be used with low impedances However the amplifier then delivers significantly lower power at clipping—43W into 8 ohms  68W into 4 ohms  and 95W into 2 ohms —with no reduction in lowpower THDFig3 darTZeel NHB108 Hi setting distortion vs 1kHz continuous output power with one channel driven into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohmsThe distortion though relatively high also remained constant with frequency as can be seen in fig4 Of more subjective importance than the absolute level of distortion present in an amplifiers output is its harmonic spectrum and here the NHB108 did well As can be seen in fig5 the distortion is predominantly loworder harmonics At low powers the subjectively benign second harmonic was dominant at higher powers the third became dominant Fig4 darTZeel NHB108 Hi setting THDN vs frequency at 283V into  8 ohms 4 ohms 2 ohms Fig5 darTZeel NHB108 Hi setting 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  0165 THDN distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig6 darTZeel NHB108 Hi setting spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 55W into 8 ohms At that point I still had one more measurement to perform the highfrequency intermodulation test in which I drive the amplifier being tested with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones and turn up the signal until the amplifier just clips I then reduce the level by a couple of dB and perform a spectral analysis of the amplifiers output signal to see what tones are present other than the original 19kHz and 20kHz components under these very demanding conditionsUnfortunately when I approached clipping with this signal a click emanated from the NHB108 which I assume was the crowbar protection circuit cutting in Before I could reach over and tug the AC cord loose there was a loud bang from the leftchannel output devices and my test lab filled with blue smoke Once my ears had stopped ringing it turned out that when Id last replaced the fuses I had inadvertently used a sloblo type for the left channel When the crowbar circuit operated the rightchannel fastblo fuse had blown as required protecting the output stage Unfortunately the left channels devices blew up to protect the fuseThe NHB108s measured performance indicates that with the exception of its slightly bent transfer function designer Hervé Delétraz has avoided the problem most commonly associated with the absence of the usual overall negativefeedback loop But that highish DC level and the hairtrigger crowbar protection make it difficult for me to recommend on a general basis The darTZeel NHB108 is like a Shelby Cobra—a handbuilt highperformance design that makes demands on its always gratified owner rather than a plugnplay neververygratifying Ford Taurus But given that caveat I was impressed by the NHB108 and my own auditioning echoes that of both Wes Phillips and John Marks I found it a very sweetsounding amplifier
