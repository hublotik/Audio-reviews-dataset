0, on one of the two FMJ P49 samples I was sent    As the P49 is specified as having a maximum power output of 200Wpc into 8 ohms I preconditioned it before the measurements by running both channels at onethird that power 67W with a 1kHz signal into 8 ohms for one hour Following that period the top panel was warm at 1098°F  though the vents covering the internal heatsinks were hotter at 1341°F  The THDnoise percentage at this power level was 0001 with the amplifier cold but 0025 with it hotPeculiarly I heard the P49 emit a mechanical whine at continuous levels greater than 54Wpc into 8 ohms Recording this sound with a microphone held over the vents in the top panel revealed that it was related to the signal frequency eg with a 1kHz signal the whine comprised tones at 2 4 and 6kHz etc with a 2kHz signal the sound comprised tones at 4 and 8kHz etc This behavior was obviously related to the powersupply voltagerail switching associated with the classG output stage as this switching occurs twice each halfcycle once the output power exceeds the threshold But it is fair to note that I could hear nothing amiss in my listening room with music playing only in the quiet surrounds of my tiny test lab with pure tones at high powersThe P49s voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms with unbalanced drive was exactly 31dB with the gain set to 31 25dB with it set to 25 Unusually the balanced gains were 6dB lower than these figures though this agrees with the specification In bridgedmono mode the gain was 6dB higher for both unbalanced and balanced inputs The unbalanced input impedance was 96k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz which will be a little on the low side for some tube preamplifiers the balanced input impedance was 96k ohms per signal phase ie 192k ohms overall Both unbalanced and balanced inputs preserved absolute polarity the XLR jacks being wired with pin 2 hotThe smallsignal output impedance was a little higher than usual for a solidstate design at 015 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 019 ohm at 20kHz  With stereo operation the modulation of the P49s frequency response that results from the interaction between the amplifiers source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was a small ±015dB  while into an 8 ohm resistive load the response rolled off sharply above 40kHz reaching –3dB at 100kHz  The response rolled off a little earlier into 2 ohms  but was still basically flat in the audioband The response in bridgedmono mode was identical to that in stereo mode Correlating with the wide smallsignal bandwidth the P49s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms had very short risetimes  Though a small degree of overshoot can be seen in this graph there is no ringingFig1 Arcam FMJ P49 balanced frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Arcam FMJ P49 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was superb at 100dB in both directions below 3kHz and still 80dB at 20kHz The unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio measured with the inputs shorted to ground measured 787dB in the left channel 799dB in the right These ratios respectively improved to 845 and 877dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband with Aweighting giving further improvement to 881 and 901dB The level of random noise in the P49s outputs was extremely low but the slightly less good SN ratios in the left channel were due to there being very low levels of spuriae present at 60Hz and its odd harmonics  These are perhaps due to the signal circuitry for that channel being closer to the large toroidal power transformer They were slightly higher in level when the amplifier was hot than when it was coldFig3 Arcam FMJ P49 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms With one channel driven the P49 comfortably exceeded its specified maximum power of 200Wpc into 8 ohms clipping at 250W into 8 ohms or 24dBW  with clipping defined as the output power when the THDN present in the output reached 1 Into 4 ohms  the Arcam clipped at the specified 400W  while in bridgedmono mode  it clipped at 750W into 8 ohms Fig4 Arcam FMJ P49 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Arcam FMJ P49 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Arcam FMJ P49 bridgedmono mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDN changed with frequency at a level  where I could be sure I was measuring distortion rather than noise Other than a small rise in the top two octaves the distortion was very low in level into 8 and 4 ohms  The P49 however was less comfortable driving the demanding 2 ohm load at this signal level  In bridgedmono mode  the topoctave rise in THDN was greater but was still 0002 at a level of 67W into 8 ohmsFig7 Arcam FMJ P49 THDN  vs frequency at 179V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms I looked at the spectral content of the distortion at a level—67Wpc into 8 ohms—where the classG voltagerail switching was operating Even so unlike the Creek Evolution 100A amplifier reviewed in July 2015  which has a similar outputstage topology no switching artifacts can be seen in the residual distortion waveform  This graph suggests that the distortion is primarily thirdharmonic in nature and while spectral analysis at a slightly higher level with the amplifier cold  reveals that the second harmonic is also present the left channel  shows significantly lower distortion than the right  The second and third harmonics are higher in bridgedmono mode  though it is fair to note that this graph was taken with the amplifier hot Intermodulation distortion was very low even at high power into 4 ohms Fig8 Arcam FMJ P49 1kHz waveform at 67W into 8 ohms

wellengineered amplifier with no problems resulting from its use of a classG output stage Prolonged running at power levels greater than the classG voltagerail transition did appear to raise distortion levels but not to anywhere near the point where they could lead to audible problems— John AtkinsonFootnote 1 See fig8 here
