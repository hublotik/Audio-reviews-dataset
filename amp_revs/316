0, OSD Nero StreamXD analog and digital streaming  amplifier It was kindly sent to me by a member for testing It costs US 230 from Amazon including Prime shipping There is a bit of heft to this box considering its budget categoryThere is a rotary control for volume and input selection Naturally with no display you dont know the volume level Various inputs are provided although USB is for storage device not as a DACI focused my testing on analog and Toslink inputsLike the inclusion of power supply in the unit which likely is the reason for some of its weight In use it got warm to touch but nothing concerningOSD Nero StreamXD MeasurementsLets start with using the analog input and see how it doesWell this is not good There is strangehigh noise floor plus plenty of distortion Perhaps it digitizes the analog input Lets test Toslink thenSame bad results  It ranks way at the bottom of our rankingsCan the news get worse Yes it canThere is a subwoofer output so maybe this is someones idea of high pass filter I looked in the manual and there are no tone controls that could be responsible for thisLet me just post the rest of the graphs and not waste words on a failing designConclusionsThis is a prime example of what we in the industry call phoned in design You call up a shop in China given them your wish list and out comes an amp You do no testing yourself and put no requirements as far as performance on the shop that is designing it Result is all the checklist items marketing wants with performance not even on the back of the priority list Does it sound better than a sound bar when paired with a couple of speakers Should that frequency response not screw things up too bad maybe For me I pass and get an AVR instead
