0,A few seconds after I first powered up Ken Micallefs review sample of the Edge A  it turned itself off its frontpanel light glowing red to indicate a fault I suspect that despite the protection afforded by the impressive packaging the box had been dropped somewhere on its way to me As Cambridges Dominic Baker was visiting the companys US office in Chicago he stopped by my Brooklyn test lab on his way back to the UK with a second sample for me to measure This second sample of the Edge A passed its selftest routine and I measured it   ing I ran it at onethird power into 8 ohms At the end of that period its heatsinks were hot at 1187°F  and its top panel was warm at 939°F Looking first at the linelevel analog inputs With the volume control at its maximum setting the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 315dB from the speaker terminals for the balanced input and 375dB for unbalanced signals  The maximum gains from the headphone and preamp outputs were a respective 92 and 1525dB The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  from all outputs The unbalanced input impedance was 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly to 394k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was 88k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 83k ohms at 20kHzThe headphone output impedance was a low 105 ohms at all audio frequencies The output impedance at the speaker terminals  was 0075 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising very slightly to 0115 ohm at 20kHz The response was flat into resistive loads  rolling off above the audioband to reach –3dB above 200kHz and any modulation of the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was within ±005dB  Fig1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum the response didnt change at lower settings of this control The Cambridges reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  was superbly square with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing apparentFig1 Cambridge Edge A analog input frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Cambridge Edge A analog input smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 110dB in both directions below 2kHz though this decreased to 80dB at 20kHz With the analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum the wideband unweighted signalnoise ratio  measured a superb 785dB Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 916dB and an Aweighting filter increased it further to 943dB  Levels of any residual spuriae at the AC powerline frequency and its harmonics were almost nonexistent in the right channel  but some very lowlevel spurious tones can be seen in the left Fig3 Cambridge Edge A analog input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms The Edge A is specified as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  or 200Wpc into 4 ohms  At our usual definition of clipping  with continuous drive in both channels the Cambridge exceeded its specification delivering 145Wpc into 8 ohms  and 230Wpc into 4 ohms  With one channel driven the Edge A clipped at 450W into 2 ohms  The downward slope below 100W in these three graphs indicates that any distortion is actually below the already very low level of noise Not only is this a very quiet amplifier it is also a superbly linear oneFig4 Cambridge Edge A analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms both channels drivenFig5 Cambridge Edge A analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms both channels drivenFig6 Cambridge Edge A analog input distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms one channel drivenDistortion levels even at 46dB below the measured clipping power were very low and were consistent with both frequency and load impedance with just a slight rise in the top two audio octaves  The shape of the spuriae waveform was obscured by noise  and the distortion signature was almost nonexistent just below halfpower into 8 ohms  At the same voltage into 4 ohms the third harmonic was the highest in level at a stilllow –99dB in the left channel  and –109dB in the right  Intermodulation distortion at high powers was also extremely low even into 4 ohms Fig7 Cambridge Edge A analog input distortion  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig8 Cambridge Edge A

ohms Fig10 Cambridge Edge A analog input spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100Wpc into 4 ohms Fig11 Cambridge Edge A analog input HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms Turning to the digital inputs the Cambridges coaxial and optical SPDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz and preserved absolute polarity Apples USB Prober utility identified the Edge A as CA Edge 20 from CA and confirmed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the Edge As USB port could handle 16 and 24bit integer data at all sample rates up to 7056kHz A 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in an output level of 144V into 8 ohms with the volume control at its maximum setting which suggests that the digital inputs have about 12dB too much gain ie a digital signal at –8dB with the volume control up full will just drive the amplifier into clipping into 8 ohmsThe Cambridges impulse response with 441kHz data  indicates that its reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type with timesymmetrical ringing to either side of the single sample at 0dBFS With 441kHzsampled white noise  the Edge As response rolled off sharply above 20kHz reaching full stopband suppression just above the Nyquist frequency of 2205kHz  An aliased image at 25kHz of a fullscale tone at 191kHz  can be just seen at –115dB The distortion harmonics of the 191kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor the highest in level being the third at –84dB Fig12 Cambridge Edge A digital input impulse response Fig13 Cambridge Edge A digital input wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz When Edge As digital frequency response with SPDIF data at 441 96 and 192kHz the response followed the same basic shape with a sharp rolloff just below the two lower sample rates  When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  the noise floor dropped by about 18dB meaning that the Edge A offers around 18 bits worth of resolution With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –9031dBFS  the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical With undithered 24bit data the result was a clean sinewave Fig14 Cambridge Edge A digital input

TosLink data Intermodulation distortion via the Edge As digital inputs was extremely low  When  digital inputs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit JTest data the oddorder harmonics of the LSBlevel lowfrequency squarewave were all at the correct levels  and no other sidebands can be seen With 24bit JTest data the resultant spectrum was superbly clean Fig18 Cambridge Edge A digital input

performance in both the analog and digital domains
