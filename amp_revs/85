0, Classé Sigma 2200i   Out of the box I ran into problems Despite Classés excellent manual I couldnt at first define one of the Sigma 2200is digital inputs to accept USB data Eventually I got the input to behave by defining the input then turning the amplifier off and back on again Then I couldnt get the Sigma 2200i to accept a balanced signal at the input marked XLR L1R1 But then I remembered that when I was setting up the USB input with the onscreen menu Id had to select a specific input connector for that input in that case USB Checking the setup menu for the XLR input it had been set by a prior user to accept a signal from the unbalanced Line 2 RCA jacks Once Id set it to accept a signal fed to the balanced XLR jacks all was well—except that the amplifier now went into standby after running for 19 minutes The manual says that A powersave feature is enabled that puts the Sigma 2200i into standby after 20 minutes without a signal at its input In my case even with a signal present the amplifier continued to turn itself off every 19 minutes Sigma 2200is performance via its digital inputs using either SPDIF signals fed from the SYS2722 or WAV and AIFF testtone files played with Pure Music 30 by my MacBook Pro running on battery power and fed via USB All  at the speaker terminals For the measurements taken to characterize the Classés performance as a conventional amplifier I fed a singleended analog signal to the Line 2 inputs or a balanced signal to the XLR inputsLooking first at the Classés performance in the digital domain Apples USB Prober utility identified the amplifier as the Sigma 2200i 22A5A7 from BW Group Ltd and confirmed that its serial number was 2270631 The USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode Apples AudioMIDI app indicated that the Classé operated at all PCM sample rates up to 192kHz via USB with integer bit depths of up to 24 With the volume control set to 00 the amplifiers output level into 8 ohms with a 1kHz sinewave at –20dBFS was 9415V meaning that it would clip with fullscale digital data I therefore set the volume control at –135 for most of the digital input tests increasing it to 00 for only the lowlevel testsThe Classés impulse response with data sampled at 441kHz  indicates that its reconstruction filter is a conventional linearphase type and that the amplifier as a whole inverts signal polarity Tested with 441kHzsampled white noise at –4dBFS  this filter can be seen to rapidly roll off the output above the Nyquist frequency  but there is an increase in ultrasonic noise above that frequency this presumably due to the Sigma 2200is PWM output stage The harmonics of a fullscale 191kHz tone  are a little higher than I was expecting with the third harmonic lying at –54dB Fig1 Classé Sigma 2200i impulse response Fig2 Classé Sigma 2200i wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS  and 191kHz tone at 0dBFS  with data sampled at 441kHz Fig3 shows spectral analyses of the Classés output while it decoded dithered 16 and 24bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS With 16bit data  the spectrum is dominated by the dither noise However with 24bit data while the noise floor has dropped by 24dB suggesting resolution of at least 20 bits harmonics of the fundamental tone are visible This graph was taken with TosLink data USB data gave an identical result But with its low noise floor in the audioband the Sigmas reproduction of an undithered 16bit signal at exactly –9031dBFS was superb  with the three DC voltage levels described by the data and the ringing of the reconstruction filter clearly visible Note that even though the traces in fig4 were taken at the speaker terminals there is zero DC offset visible This is rare with amplifiers having a conventional output stageFig3 Classé Sigma 2200i 441kHz SPDIF data spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16bit data  24bit data  Fig4 Classé Sigma 2200i waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –9031dBFS 16bit data Tested for its digital inputs rejection of wordclock jitter with 16bit 441kHz data the Sigma 2200i didnt accentuate or attenuate the oddorder harmonics of the JTests lowfrequency LSBlevel squarewave  However the spectral peak that represents the highlevel tone at onequarter the sample rate has widened at its base which suggests the presence of random lowfrequency jitter Also visible is a patch of spurious lowlevel tones between 9 and 10kHz that were present with 24bit JTest data  A wider spectral analysis reveals these more clearly  as well as an idle tone of unknown origin at 15kHzFig5 Classé Sigma 2200i highresolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal 11025kHz at –6dBFS sampled at 441kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz 16bit TosLink data  Center

24bit USB data Also in fig7 can be seen the start of the PWM output stages ultrasonic noise floor Because of the presence of this noise when  amplifiers performance using analog input signals I used Audio Precisions highorder AES17 highpass filter when measuring distortion as otherwise the reading would be obscured by the noiseThe Sigma 2200is overall gain via its analog inputs with the volume control set to 00 was 274dB balanced and 334dB unbalanced the 6dB difference being in the opposite direction to what I usually find All the analog inputs inverted absolute polarity and the unbalanced input impedance was 46k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 35k ohms at 20kHz The balanced input impedance was a high 90k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz 84k ohms at 20kHzThe analog inputs are converted to 96kHzsampled digital so the Sigma 2200is frequency response measured via these inputs rolls off sharply above 40kHz  The output impedance was 01 ohm at low and middle frequencies but rose to 15 ohms at the top of the audioband The response therefore peaks a little between 10 and 40kHz into higher impedances which in turn results in overshoot with a 1kHz squarewave  But with 2 ohms the high output impedance at high frequencies results in an output that is down by 4dB at 20kHz  Although there is very little change in the amplifiers frequency response below 1kHz with our standard simulated loudspeaker  the topoctave sound of the Sigma 2200i will vary more than usual depending on the loudspeakers used With a 10kHz squarewave the 96kHz sample rate gives a bandlimited response  that also reveals the presence of the ultrasonic noiseFig8 Classé Sigma 2200i frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig9 Classé Sigma 2200i smallsignal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsFig10 Classé Sigma 2200i smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsThe effects of the Sigma 2200is treble and bass tone controls set to their maximum and minimum settings is shown in fig11 The boost and cut are sensibly chosen I didnt test the effect of the Tilt control as I couldnt manage to set this correctly using the onscreen menu Channel separation was good at 80dB L–R and 90dB R–L below 3kHz Though the output was commendably free from powersupply–related spuriae  the wideband signalnoise ratio ref 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the analog input shorted to ground and the volume control set to 00 was affected by the output stages ultrasonic noise and was just 297dB  Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the SN ratio to 581dB Aweighting further increased it to 7575dBFig11 Classé Sigma 2200i frequency response at 283V into 8 ohms with bass and treble controls set to 0  6  –6  Fig12 Classé Sigma 2200i spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms I then plotted how the percentage of THDnoise varied with output power using the AES17 lowpass filter set to 20kHz The Classé offered very low distortion and high power below clipping into 8 ohms  and 4 ohms  These graphs reveal that the amplifier clipped at 215Wpc into 8 ohms  and 410Wpc into 4 ohms  both powers slightly higher than the specified 23dBWFig13 Classé Sigma 2200i distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig14 Classé Sigma 2200i distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig15 shows how the THDN percentage varied with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The AES17 lowpass filter was again set to 20kHz which is why the graph ends at 5kHz rather than the usual 20kHz in order not to eliminate the higher harmonics The distortion is very low into 8 ohms  with a slight rise in the treble The THDN percentage rises more at high frequencies into lower impedances with the 2 ohm measurement higher than 01 above 1kHz  The distortion at this power level seems primarily to be the third harmonic  accompanied by some lowerlevel higher oddorder harmonics  Assessed with my usual mix of equallevel 19 and 20kHz tones the intermodulation distortion was very low  However you can see in this graph the start of the rise in the ultrasonic noise floor examined in more detail in fig19Fig15 Classé Sigma 2200i THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms Fig16 Classé Sigma 2200i 1kHz waveform at 100W into 4 ohms 0017 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig17 Classé Sigma 2200i spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms Fig18 Classé Sigma 2200i HF intermodulation spectrum DC–24kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms Fig19 Classé Sigma 2200i HF intermodulation spectrum DC–50kHz 1920kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms Its use of a PWM output stage doesnt seem to have compromised the Classé Sigma 2200is measured performance and the amplifier offers high power in an attractively lightweight package But I dont think it would be a good match for loudspeakers that would present it with impedances as low as 2 ohms Footnote 1 My thanks to Jürgen Reis of MBL for suggesting this test to me
