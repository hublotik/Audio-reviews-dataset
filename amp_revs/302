0, Yamaha AU671 USB DAC and integrated class D amplifier The AU671 costs US 499 but most vendors say it is no longer available even though it shows as current on Yamaha site How fast modern gear becomes obsoleteYamaha has been clever to mimic the look of 1970s and 1980s switchgearAlas the controls are plastic and dont have nearly the nice feel of their old brethren The volume control is motorized though and is operable through the remote A builtin DAC and analog input would nicely satisfy many people Unfortunately the unit arrived with something rattling in it I took it part to find out it was a clamp of sort for the power supply bundle that had come loose I put it back together and all worked except the USB DAC I could control it change its sample rate and such but it would not produce audio  Another one of the power supply screws was also loose They should have put thread lock on them so that they dont come loose The back panel is as expected but with decent quality speaker terminalsSince I had to take the unit apart anyway here is a quick teardownThe DAC is on top and the amp on the bottom of the green board The yellow board is the switching power supply And that black wrapper is what had come loseIn use the amp was very quick to shut down on overload It would actually power off telling me it may be the power supply that is undersized Temperature rise is not remotely an issue Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load  5 wattsI set the volume control manually to 29 dB as I normally do with integrated amps SINAD which represents the worst of noise andor distortion is dominated by distortion At 70 dB this is well below averageSignal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about eitherCrosstalk is good Frequency response is problematic showing that it changes with your speaker loadMultitone shows frequency dependent error and high noise floorHere are the power ratingsThe regulated switching power supply allows no headroomThermal StabilityNot a whole lot changed with warmupConclusionsI have a soft spot for the look of the Yamaha AU671 And inclusion of a USB DAC in a light and compact enclosure Not much else to hang your hat on from there on If you can find one at a yard sale for 100 it would be a good purchase I dont know that I would buy it over so many other modern choices with Room EQ and streaming builtin
