       "['  McIntosh MC462,    .  ,   MC462 by running its 8 ohm output at one-third power for 30 minutes into 8 ohms—thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-AB or class-B output stage. At the end of that time the heatsinks were very hot, at 158.6°F  . I usually precondition amplifiers for an hour, but I was concerned that the MC462 would get even hotter.The McIntoshs voltage gain varied according to which output Autoformer tap was used and whether the balanced or unbalanced inputs were used. From the balanced inputs, the 8 ohm taps gain into 8 ohms was a lower-than-usual 22.9dB, the 4 ohm taps gain lower at 20.4dB, and the 2 ohms even lower, at 17.4dB. The gains using the unbalanced input were 6dB higher rather than 6dB lower; the latter is usually the case. All three sets of outputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLR jacks being wired with pin 2 hot, the modern standard.The MC462s unbalanced input impedance measured very close to the specified 22k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced, as expected. The output impedance was lowest from the 8 ohm Autoformer tap, at 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.13 ohm at 20kHz. The 4 ohm taps output impedance was almost twice that of the 8 ohm tap—not what I was expecting—while the 2 ohm taps was 0.14 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.185 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±0.2dB  . The channels levels match to within 0.1dB, and the audioband response into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms   is flat up to 20kHz. Into 2 ohms  , a slight top-octave rolloff reaches –0.4dB at 20kHz. The MC462 reproduced a 1kHz squarewave with short risetimes and flat tops and bottoms  , suggesting that the amplifiers use of output transformers doesnt affect its low-frequency reproduction. A 10kHz squarewave was reproduced without overshoot or ringing  .Fig.1 McIntosh MC462  , frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 McIntosh MC462  , small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 McIntosh MC462  , small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The McIntosh MC462s channel separation   was superb, measuring close to 120dB in both directions below 1kHz, though it did decrease to 70dB at 20kHz, due to capacitive coupling between the channels at some point in the circuit. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured at the highest-gain output   and with the balanced input shorted to ground, was equally superb, at 87dB. This ratio improved to 96.2dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 99.6dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the MC462s noise floor   revealed spuriae at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, these due to magnetic interference from the AC power transformer. All of these spuriae are very low in level, however, and will not be audible.Fig.4 McIntosh MC462  , channel separation.Fig.5 McIntosh MC462  , spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .McIntosh specifies the MC462 as being able to deliver 450Wpc   into a load matched to the nominal output Autoformer tap. With clipping defined as being when the THD+noise reaches 1%,  .6 indicates that the MC462 exceeded its specification even with both channels driven, its 8 ohm output clipping at 516Wpc into 8 ohms  . The trace in this graph stops at 1%, as that is when the amplifiers protection was triggered. Into 4 ohms  , the McIntoshs 8 ohm output clipped at 720Wpc  . Its fair to note that I dont hold the wall voltage constant for this test; with both channels clipping into 4 ohms, the wall voltage had dropped from 121 to 115.4V. The MC462s 2 ohm output delivered 190Wpc   with both channels driven into 8 ohms at 1% THD+N, 298Wpc with both channels driven into 4 ohms  , and 536W   with one channel driven into 2 ohms  .Fig.6 McIntosh MC462  , both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 McIntosh MC462  , both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 McIntosh MC462  , both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.9 McIntosh MC462  , both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Figs. 6–9 indicate that distortion is extremely low, lying below the noise floor at powers below 30W or so. I therefore plotted how the THD+N changed with frequency from the 8 ohm output at a level of 28.3V, equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms and 200W into 4 ohms, where I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise. The result   reveals that the THD into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms   rises above 1kHz, but still remains below 0.007%. I havent shown the THD+N trace into 2 ohms from this output, because it was >2% in the midrange and treble and >3% in the bass at 28.3V, which is equivalent to 400W into 2 ohms. The moral: Match the MC462s nominal output to the lowest impedance magnitude of the loudspeaker used.Fig.10 McIntosh MC462  , THD+N   vs frequency at 28.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion signature is primarily of the second and third harmonics  ; these components are very low in level, even at high powers  , though the right channel   had slightly more distortion than the left  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at high power into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm output, the levels of higher-order intermodulation products were extremely low  , and the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at a \"roots-of-the-universe\" –114dB  .Fig.11 McIntosh MC462  , 1kHz waveform at 50Wpc into 8 ohms, 0.00056% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 McIntosh MC462  , spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 McIntosh MC462  , HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Summing up the McIntosh MC462s measured performance is easy: It is an extraordinarily well-engineered, exceptionally powerful amplifier.

       " '  Primare A35.8  . As the A35.8 has class-D output stages, all measurements other than frequency response were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which mitigates noise above 80kHz and eliminates noise above 200kHz.   Without the filter, 325mV of ultrasonic noise was present at each pair of loudspeaker terminals, with a center frequency of 396kHz. Because the AUX-0025 filter is a two-channel device, I could only measure two of the Primares eight channels at a time. Almost all the measured performance was taken from channels 6 and 8, with the bridged-mode tests performed with channels 5 and 6 linked and channels 7 and 8 linked. I dont precondition class-D amplifiers before testing, but after an hours operation, the top panels temperature had stabilized at a warm 102.2°F  .As with Primares two-channel A35.2 that Herb Reichert reviewed in May 2020, the A35.8s balanced inputs offered 6dB lower voltage gain into 8 ohms than the single-ended inputs, at 19.95dB compared with 25.95dB.   The voltage gains in bridged mode were identical, but they were exactly 6dB higher in \"bridged +6\" mode. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both balanced and unbalanced input signals in both normal and bridged modes. The balanced input impedance was close to the specified 36k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance, specified as 15k ohms, was 14.7k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 13.25k ohms at the top of the audioband.Including the series impedance of 6 of spaced-pair loudspeaker cable, the A35.8s output impedance in normal mode was a very low 0.078 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.092 ohm at 20kHz. Bridged mode increased these impedances only slightly. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was minimal, at ±0.1dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  , taken without the Audio Precision low-pass filter, was flat almost to 20kHz with then a rolloff of 1dB at 30kHz. Unusually, the ultrasonic rolloff was disturbed by resonant peaks at 60kHz and 100kHz. The Primares reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  , taken with the Audio Precision low-pass filter so that the waveform was not obscured by ultrasonic noise, was clean, without any ringing on the tops and bottom and with minimal overshoot.Fig.1 Primare A35.8, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Primare A35.8, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Separation between adjacent channels was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 1kHz, reducing to a still good 76dB at the top of the audioband. Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and with the auxiliary low-pass filter in circuit, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was a good 74dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to a superb 96dB when I restricted the measurement bandwidth to the audioband, and to 98.6dB when the reading was A-weighted. Low-level spuriae at the 60Hz power supply frequency and its harmonics were absent from the Primares low-frequency noisefloor  .Fig.3 Primare A35.8, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Primare specifies the A35.8s maximum power as 150W into 8 ohms and 300W into 4 ohms, both equivalent to 21.76dBW. Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the Primare exceeded its specified power with two channels driven into 8 ohms, clipping at 200Wpc  . With two channels driven into 4 ohms, the A35.8 clipped at the specified 300Wpc  . Again, with two channels operating but in bridged mode, the Primare clipped at 730W into 8 ohms  , just below the specified 740W into this load. In bridged mode into 4 ohms, the clipping power was 1kW   compared with the specified 750W.Fig.4 Primare A35.8, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Primare A35.8, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Primare A35.8, bridged mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency in normal mode at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was very low in the midrange into 8, 4, and 2 ohms  , but rose in the top octave. Peculiarly, with each channel driven separately, the THD+N was lower in the midrange and below into 2 ohms   than it was into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Primare A35.8, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms   2 ohms  .The A35.8s distortion at 50W into 8 ohms was very low and predominantly the third harmonic  , though bursts of HF noise coincide with the waveform peaks, even with the Audio Precision auxiliary filter in circuit. The third harmonic lay at a very low –108dB   in channel 8  , –103dB   in channel 6  , with the second harmonic close to 10dB lower in level in both channels. In bridged mode at the same power into 8 ohms  , the third harmonic lay at the same –103dB but the second and fifth harmonics were about 10dB higher in level than they had been in normal mode. With an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms  , while high-order intermodulation products lay at or below –94dB  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay below –110dB  . This spectrum was taken in normal mode. The intermodulation distortion was similar in bridged mode.Fig.8 Primare A35.8, channel 8, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0049% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Primare A35.8, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Primare A35.8, bridged mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Primare A35.8, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .The Primare A35.8 offers high power, especially in bridged mode, with very low levels of distortion and audioband noise.

       " 'The NAD C 298 can be operated as a conventional stereo amplifier or as a bridged-mono amplifier.   As Kal Rubinson auditioned the NAD both in stereo mode and as a pair of monoblocks, I performed a complete set of measurements in both modes. The C 298 has an output stage operating in class-D, so I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter between the test load and my   system  . This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slew-rate limiting, and I used it for all the tests other than frequency response.The C 298 has both balanced and single-ended inputs; I performed most of the measurements using the balanced inputs, repeating some tests with the unbalanced inputs. With the amplifier in stereo and fixed-gain modes, I measured a voltage gain of 28.6dB into 8 ohms with both types of inputs. With the amplifier switched to variable-gain mode, the voltage gain could be varied between 9.35dB and 28.5dB. In mono mode, the C 298s gain into 8 ohms was 25.3dB in fixed-gain mode but could be varied between 15.4dB and 34.55dB in the variable-gain mode. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both types of inputs in both stereo and mono modes, as well as from the preamplifier output. The XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 hot.The input impedance is specified as a high 56k ohms with both types of input. My measurement was close to the specification for the single-ended inputs, at 49k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz. This dropped inconsequentially to 35k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was 100k ohms at 1kHz and a little lower at the frequency extremes. The gain at the preamplifier outputs was –0.1dB, sourced from an impedance of 655 ohms at 20Hz and 385 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz.With the NAD amplifier in stereo mode, I measured a very low output impedance of 0.06 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.072 ohms at 20kHz.   The output impedance was only slightly higher in mono mode, at 0.063 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 0.082 ohms at 20kHz. The modulation of the NADs frequency response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore very low, at ±0.05dB  . This graph was taken in stereo mode; the responses were identical in mono mode. The small-signal bandwidth was restricted by the low-pass filter between the amplifiers class-D stage and its output terminals. Into 8 ohms  , the ultrasonic rolloff reached –3dB at 66kHz. This rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  . There is a critically damped overshoot on the tops and bottoms of the waveform, but there is no ringing.Fig.1 NAD C 298, stereo mode, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 NAD C 298, stereo mode, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation in stereo mode was superb, at >110dB in both directions below 1kHz and still close to 80dB at 20kHz. Without the auxiliary low-pass filter, 180mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the C 298s output terminals. With the AP filter and the C 298 set to stereo mode and fixed gain, the unweighted, wideband signal/ noise ratio, taken with the single-ended inputs shorted to ground, was 78.5dB   ref. 1W into 8 ohms. It improved to 95.1dB when I restricted the measurement to the audioband and to 99dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit.These ratios were affected only slightly by switching the amplifier in stereo mode to variable-gain mode and adjusting the gain from minimum to maximum. This can be seen in  .3, which shows the spectrum of the low-frequency noise floor with the gain set to its minimum   and to its maximum  . The only power supply–related component visible in this graph is at 60Hz, but this is negligible at almost –120dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. With the C 298 set to bridged mono and with the variable gain set to its minimum, the noise floor was identical to what it had been in stereo mode other than no longer having a 60Hz component  . However, increasing the gain to its maximum now raised the noise floor by around 10dB  .Fig.3 NAD C 298, stereo mode and variable gain, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with maximum gain   and minimum gain    .Fig.4 NAD C 298, mono mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with maximum variable gain   and fixed gain    .The C 298s rated power in stereo mode is specified as 185Wpc into 8 ohms   and 340W into 4 ohms  . The NAD exceeded its specified power into both impedances. With both channels driven and clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1%, the C 298 clipped at 275W into 8 ohms   and at 510W into 4 ohms  . What is extraordinary about these two graphs is that the harmonic distortion reaches 0.0005% or lower at powers between 20W and 180W into 8 ohms and between 40W and 70W into 4 ohms.   The C 298 is one of the lowest-distortion amplifiers I have measured, rivaling the less powerful Benchmark AHB2 that KR reviewed in November 2015.Fig.5 NAD C 298, stereo mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 NAD C 298, stereo mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.In bridged-mono mode, the NADs rated power is specified as 620W into 8 ohms  . Again, the C 298 exceeded its specified power, clipping at 980W into 8 ohms  . NAD doesnt recommend using the amplifier in mono mode to drive impedances below 8 ohms. Nevertheless, I measured a clipping power of 880W into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 NAD C 298, mono mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.I examined how the THD+N percentage in the C 298s output in stereo mode varied with frequency at 14V  . I tried a higher output level—20V—but the amplifier went into protection mode after a short while driving the higher frequencies at 2 ohms. The distortion into 8 ohms was very low  , though it started to rise in the top octave. The distortion hardly rose into 4 ohms   and only by a little into 2 ohms  .Fig.8 NAD C 298, stereo mode, THD+N   vs frequency at 14V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The NAD amplifiers distortion signature at high power in both stereo and mono modes into 4 ohms was primarily third harmonic  .   Spectral analysis confirmed that this harmonic was slightly higher in level in the right channel   than the left  , though at –124dB ref. 100W into 8 ohms  , it is negligible. Note the commendable absence of higher-order harmonics in this graph. At the same output voltage into 4 ohms, which is equivalent to 200W, the third harmonic rose to –110dB in the left channel and to a still very low –104dB in the right  . In bridged-mono mode at 100W into 8 ohms, the second and third harmonics both lay at –120dB  , though the third harmonic rose to –100dB   at the same voltage into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 NAD C 298, stereo mode, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 200W into 4 ohms, 0.0031% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 NAD C 298, stereo mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 NAD C 298, stereo mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.12 NAD C 298, mono mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 NAD C 298, mono mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .With an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones and the signal peaking at 200W into 4 ohms, intermodulation in stereo mode was extremely low  . Surprisingly, the higher-order products were even lower in mono mode at 00W into 8 ohms, though the difference product at 1kHz still lay below –120dB  .Fig.14 NAD C 298, stereo mode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 200Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Fig.15 NAD C 298, mono mode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .Going back to the days when NADs amplifiers were designed by the late Björn Erik Edvardsen, I have always been impressed by the companys conservative and competent engineering. The NAD C 298 continues that tradition but, with its \"Eigentakt\" class-D output modules, sets a new standard for combining very high power with supremely low distortion. Footnote 1: This impressively high power could not however be sustained for more than 30 seconds or so. The owners manual says that running the C 298 in bridged-mono mode to drive impedances lower than 8 ohms \"may cause the amplifiers thermal cut-out to operate if played at high levels.\" Very likely, a bridged NAD 298 would perform well into loads less than 8 ohms at normal listening levels—and it would then have impressive short-term reserves to draw on for transient power. Indeed, while NAD does not recommend bridged C 298 for use with loads below 8 ohms, it specifies the bridged amp as having an impressive 1100W of \"IHF dynamic power\" into 4 ohms when bridged.Whats going on? In effect, bridging an amplifier cuts the impedance the amplifier sees in half, so while the amp has more power, it needs more power to drive a more difficult load. The same phenomenon is at work in all bridged amplifiers.—Editor          ',\n",
       " 'The McIntosh MC501 is unusual for a solid-state amplifier in that it uses an output transformer. This has three separate taps, one each optimized for 8, 4, and 2 ohm speakers. I hooked up my 8 ohm dummy load to the MC501s 8 ohm tap, and, following my usual practice, set the amplifier running at one-third power for one hour, to see how well it would deal with thermal stress. To my surprise, the McIntosh shut itself off after just five minutes—the orange Power Guard LED on the front panel illuminated, and the rear-panel heatsinks were too hot to touch. After the amp had cooled down, it turned itself on again. I tried running it at a lower level, just 30W into 8 ohms. This time it turned itself off after 20 minutes; again, the heatsinks were too hot to touch.The heatsinks are relatively small for an amplifier with a continuous rating of 500W. I must assume that McIntosh decided that continuous running with sinewaves would be sufficiently rare that they could economize in this area. When this circumstance did arise, their Sentry Monitor circuit, which monitors heatsink temperature, would protect the amplifier against thermal runaway.Measured via its balanced input, the MC501s voltage gain was low, at 23.3dB from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms, 20.64dB from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms, and 16.8dB from the 2 ohm tap into 2 ohms. Several volts will therefore be required from a balanced preamplifier to drive the Mac to its maximum output power. Unusually but conforming to the specification, the unbalanced gains were 6dB higher, meaning that unbalanced preamplifiers will not have to deliver quite so high an output voltage. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , and the input impedance at 1kHz measured 9.15k ohms unbalanced, 18.3k ohms balanced—on the low side for some capacitor-coupled tube preamplifiers, such as the BAT models.The lower-than-normal gain is associated with an extremely low noise floor. Even the wideband, unweighted  ure ref. 1W into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm tap was 90dB; switching in an A-weighting filter improved the  ure to 104.6dB. The MC501 is one of the few amplifiers that can match the theoretical dynamic range of such hi-rez digital media as SACD and DVD-Audio.When   MC501s output impedance, I was surprised to find it to be lowest from the 8 ohm tap, at 0.08 ohm, and highest from the 2 ohm tap, at 0.13 ohm  —the opposite of what I expected. These values held from 20Hz to 1kHz; there was a slight rise from all three taps at the top of the audioband to 0.16 ohm.These low source impedances mean that any variation in frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between them and the variation in impedance with frequency of a typical speaker will be ±0.1dB or less, as can be seen from the top trace in  .1. This graph shows the family of responses from the 8 ohm tap. The amplifiers bandwidth decreases with decreasing load impedances, but when the output tap is matched to the load, the -3dB point lies at 120kHz  , 100kHz  , and 68kHz  . This is superb performance for an amplifier with an output transformer. As a result of this wide bandwidth, the MC501s reproduction of 1kHz   and 10kHz   squarewaves was essentially perfect.Fig.1 McIntosh MC501, 8 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms  .Fig.2 McIntosh MC501, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 McIntosh MC501, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The McIntoshs maximum output power depended on the output tap chosen and the load, but when the tap was matched to the load, the amplifier easily exceeded its specified 500W at our 1% THD definition of clipping. The 8 ohm tap delivered no less than 720W into 8 ohms  , for example  , with similar deliveries into 4 and 2 ohms from their respective taps  . Despite the slight increase in source impedance, the MC501s ability to deliver current into the speaker load did increase with the decreasing output transformer tap. The 8 ohm tap was limited to 225W into 2 ohms  , for example, while the 4 ohm tap delivered 1000W  , the 2 ohm tap 630W  .Fig.4 McIntosh MC501, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.Fig.5 McIntosh MC501, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.Fig.6 McIntosh MC501, 2 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.The big power meter on the front-panel didnt appear to be that accurately calibrated. An indicated \"50W\" was equivalent to an actual 30W into 4 ohms from the 4 ohm tap, for example.The McIntosh also featured extremely low levels of harmonic distortion in its output. Taking a clue from the plots of THD+noise percentage against power in  s.4-6,   THD+N percentage against frequency at a high power level of 240W from each of the output taps into a matched load  . Yes, a very slight rise in THD can be seen above the audioband, but the McIntosh is otherwise extremely linear.Fig.7 McIntosh MC501, 4 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 240W from  : 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms; 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms; 2 ohm tap into 2 ohms.What harmonic content is present is primarily third harmonic, but as the output current increases, a very small amount of higher harmonics appears at the signals zero-crossing points  . Note that to even see this distortion waveform on the storage oscilloscope screen, I had to run the MC501 at 480W into 4 ohms from the 4 ohm tap and average 64 individual captures to lift the harmonic content out of the noise.   This superb linearity is shown in the frequency domain in  .9, the spectrum of a 50Hz sinewave driven at 470W into 4 ohms from the 8 ohm tap. The third harmonic lies at just -93dB  , with almost all the higher harmonics at or below -100dB  .Fig.8 McIntosh MC501, 4 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 480W into 4 ohms  , 0.00075% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 McIntosh MC501, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC-1kHz, at 470W into 4 ohms  .Finally, even at close to the MC501s specified output power, the 1kHz difference component resulting from an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones lay below -100dB  —extraordinarily good performance from any amplifier, let alone from one with an output transformer.Fig.10 McIntosh MC501, 4 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-24kHz, 19+20kHz at 500W into 4 ohms  .I thought the McIntosh amplifiers sounded simply superb when I auditioned them in Paul Bolins system in the spring. Nothing in the MC501s measured performance causes me to doubt what I heard.           ',\n",
       " '  one of the Halcro dm88 monoblocks   by running it for 60 minutes at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms. With the amplifier cold, the measured THD+noise was just 0.00093%! The  ure was the same at the end of the hour; while the left-hand side panel was gently warm, the right-hand panel was still cool. It wasnt possible to measure the dm88s Current Mode input; I performed complete sets of measurements via the dm88s balanced and unbalanced Voltage Mode inputs, as well as via its unbalanced Minimal Path jack.The dm88s voltage gain was a higher-than-average 29.4dB into 8 ohms via the unbalanced Voltage Mode input; unusually, it dropped by 6dB, to 23.4dB, using the balanced jack. The Minimal Path gain was also low, at 23.1dB. Both Voltage Mode inputs preserved absolute polarity— ie, were noninverting  —but the Minimal Path input inverted signal polarity. The unbalanced Voltage Mode input impedance was a little higher than usual for a solid-state design, ranging from 25k ohms at 20Hz to 22k ohms at 1kHz, though it dropped further, to 17.5k ohms, at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was exactly twice the unbalanced, as expected. However, the Minimal Path input had a very low impedance of 650 ohms across the audioband. As well as explaining the slightly lower voltage gain via this input, this low input impedance will be incompatible with many preamplifiers, especially those using tubed output stages.The dm88s output impedance was very low across almost all the audioband, at 0.1 ohm including 6 of multistrand speaker cable. It rose slightly at 20kHz, to 0.14 ohm, though the increase is insignificant. As a result, any alteration of the amplifiers frequency response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker remained within tight ±0.1dB limits  . The responses shown in this graph were taken via the balanced Voltage Mode jack; it is 3dB down at 122kHz into 8 ohms, with a slightly earlier ultrasonic rolloff into low impedances. The low frequencies are down 0.5dB at 20Hz.Fig.1 Halcro dm88, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .The LF response was identical via the unbalanced Voltage Mode input, though the ultrasonic response extended a little higher, to –3dB at 172kHz  . This extended ultrasonic response was the same via the Minimal Path jack, but the bass is now flat to below 10Hz  . The extended HF response gives rise to an excellent 1kHz squarewave response  , and the 10kHz waveform is free from ringing or overshoot  .Fig.2 Halcro dm88, Minimal Path frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms  .Fig.3 Halcro dm88, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.4 Halcro dm88, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The dm88s noise floor was very low. Referenced to a level of 2.83V into 8 ohms  , the A-weighted signal/noise ratio with the input short-circuited was an extraordinary 105.6dB. Even the wideband, unweighted measurement was 84.7dB! This is an amplifier that can take full advantage of the high resolution promised by SACD and DVD-Audio.As expected from its pedigree, the dm88 can put out high powers with very low distortion, at least into higher impedances. Fig.5 plots the percentage of THD+noise in the amplifiers output against output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The downward slope of the traces below 10W in this graph implies that the actual distortion is below the noise floor, even with the Halcros very low level of noise in absolute terms. Above that power level, the amplifiers behavior depends on the load impedance. The distortion remains very low into 8 ohms, the small discontinuities in the trace indicating that the measurement is at the limit of the Audio Precision System Ones resolving power. Into 4 ohms, however, and even more so into 2 ohms, the distortion begins to rise at high powers, though still not to any level that might be considered subjectively significant.   The amplifier does clip very suddenly.Fig.5 Halcro dm88, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.The measured output power at 1% THD+N was greater than specified, at 295W into 8 ohms   and 525W into 4 ohms  . The dm88 is less happy driving 2 ohms, however, clipping at 266W  .The low levels of THD at small-signal levels made it more informative to plot the dm88s THD against frequency at a higher-than-usual output voltage, where the actual distortion would be above the noise. Fig.6 shows how the dm88s THD changes into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The traces are flat with frequency, suggesting that the amplifier has a commendably wide open-loop bandwidth. However, the distortion does increase as the load drops. Peculiarly, the THD was a little higher, at 0.0017% across the band, from the Minimal Path input  . Figs.7 and 8 reveal that the primary harmonic content is the third, and that while this rises in level into low impedances, it is not joined by other harmonics. Given both the subjectively benign nature of the third harmonic and the very low level of the distortion in absolute terms, even into 2 ohms, I think it safe to say that the dm88s audible distortion signature will be nonexistent.Fig.6 Halcro dm88, THD+N  vs frequency at 20V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.7 Halcro dm88, 1kHz waveform at 90W into 8 ohms  , 0.00093% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Halcro dm88, 1kHz waveform at 196W into 4 ohms  , 0.0038% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 plots the spectrum of the dm88s output while it drives 50Hz at one-third power into 8 ohms. The third harmonic lies at just –106dB  , though the second harmonic makes an appearance at –103dB   with this low-frequency tone.   Halving the load impedance didnt affect the second-harmonic level, but the third rose to –86dB  , as expected from the waveform graphs. Intermodulation distortion was very low, even at very high powers into 4 ohms  . The amplifier didnt misbehave when I drove it into clipping with this very demanding signal.  Fig.9 Halcro dm88, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Halcro dm88, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 453W peak into 4 ohms  .As I have come to expect from Bruce Candy designs, the dm88 offers superb measured performance.

       " '  MBL Reference 9011, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . Before doing the testing, I ran the MBL, serial number 40431, at one-third its rated power for 30 minutes, which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-A/B output stage.   At the end of that period, the chassis was only mildly warm. However, the third section of heatsinks from the front on the amplifiers right-hand side was hottish, at 115°F  .  The amplifier was tested as a bridged monoblock, as that is how MF used the pair of 9011s in his auditioning, with all three AC transformers active. The voltage gain into 8 ohms from the balanced input, assessed between the two positive terminal posts  , was 27.1dB. The 9011 preserved absolute polarity when the positive speaker lead was connected to the uppermost binding post. The balanced input impedance was the specified 20k ohms in the bass and midrange, dropping slightly to 16k ohms at the top of the audioband.The output impedance was very low, at 0.05 ohm at 1kHz and below, rising to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz.   As a result, the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was minimal  . This graph also shows that, into higher impedances, the MBL 9011 has a very wide small-signal bandwidth, its response into 8 ohms   dropping by just 1.65dB at 200kHz. The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave therefore has a superbly square shape with very low risetimes  .Fig.1 MBL Reference 9011, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 MBL Reference 9011, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The amplifiers ultrasonic output decreases into lower impedances, however, the response being –3dB at 85kHz into 2 ohms  . Even so, with an amplifier with a wide bandwidth like this, it is important to use interconnects that are correctly shielded. The amplifier might not go into overload, as happened with MFs TARA Labs and ZenSati interconnects, but the presence of RF interference can still have an unpredictable effect on sound quality.When   Ypsilon BC1 transformers Michael used to convert the VST-100 Mk.II preamplifiers single-ended output to balanced, these both broke the ground connection between preamp and power amps and had a frequency response that rose significantly above the audioband  . Both of these factors exacerbated the MBL 9011s possible susceptibility to picking up RF interference, particularly with the unshielded ZenSati interconnects.Even with its wide small-signal bandwidth, the Reference 9011 was a quiet amplifier. Its unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms, was 83.7dB, with all AC-supply–related components lying below 100dB. The A-weighted ratio, again ref. 2.828V into 8 ohms, was a superb 102.7dBA, equivalent to 130dBA ref. the measured clipping power into 8 ohms  , which was 540W  , almost 1dB greater than the specified 440W  . This amplifier has true 20-bit dynamic range. The amplifier clipped at 870W into 4 ohms  , compared with the specified 840W  , but fell below its specified power of 1390W into 2 ohms  , at a measured 1190W  . This is most likely because I dont hold the AC wall voltage steady during these tests. It was 122.1V with the amplifier idling, 121V with the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms, but 117.4V at clipping into 2 ohms.Fig.3 MBL Reference 9011, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.4 MBL Reference 9011, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.5 MBL Reference 9011, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.To ensure that I was measuring actual distortion rather than noise, I examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 25V output. Even so, as shown in  .6, the MBL 9011 was extremely linear. Into 8 and 4 ohms  , the rise in THD in the treble was minuscule, though it was more pronounced into 2 ohms  . The distortion was predominantly third harmonic in nature  , though this was still very low in level  . Intermodulation distortion with the punishing equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, tested at a level about 3dB below visual clipping on the oscilloscope, was also low  . The difference product at 1kHz was at –120dB  , though the higher-order products were up to 20dB higher in level.Fig.6 MBL Reference 9011, THD+N   vsfrequency at 25V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 MBL Reference 9011, 1kHz waveform at 507W into 4 ohms  , 0.0045% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 MBL Reference 9011, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 400Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 MBL Reference 9011, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 400W peak into 4 ohms  .The MBL Reference 9011 measures superbly, as I have come to expect from this German manufacturer. There doesnt appear to be any technical reasons why the 9011 would sound different from the Reference 9007, which, from my experience, sounds very much like Michael described it in his 2006 review. But owners should both take their dealers advice on what cables are best to use with this very–wide-bandwidth amplifier and use it with preamplifiers having a true balanced output.           ',\n",
       " 'As I usually do with power amplifiers,   Marantz SM-11S1 Reference by running both channels at one-third the maximum measured power into 8 ohms for one hour. Thermally, this maximally stresses an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. At the end of that period, while the wire grilles set into the top panel were hot, the chassis was barely warm. The Marantz has adequate heatsinking for an amplifier of its rated power. In addition, the measured THD+noise percentage didnt change through the preconditioning, indicating a stable design topology. The LCD power meter on the front panel was quite accurate, indicating \"48.8W\" with the amplifier driving a measured 48.5Wpc into 8 ohms. The meter also takes impedance into account; halving the impedance from 8 to 4 ohms almost doubled the indicated power.Though it can be bridged for mono operation,   Marantz in stereo mode, which is how Michael Fremer listened to it. The SM-11S1s gain can be adjusted over a range of ±6dB. The amplifier was set to its factory default for the review, indicated on the meter as \"Gain = 0\"; in this condition, the voltage gain into 8 ohms was significantly lower than the norm, at 22.35dB from the balanced inputs and 22.7dB from the unbalanced inputs, both  ures slightly lower than the specified 23.0dB. The unbalanced input preserved absolute polarity; the balanced input inverted polarity, however, confirming that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 3 rather than pin 2 hot  . The unbalanced input impedance was a little lower than specified, at around 18k ohms across the audioband, dropping very slightly and inconsequentially to 17.2k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input offered twice these values, as expected.The SM-11S1s output impedance was very low, at 0.08 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising slightly to 0.11 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction between this impedance and that of the loudspeaker is below ±0.1dB  . The amplifiers output into 8 ohms is down by less than 2dB at 200kHz  , but the small-signal bandwidth does decrease slightly into lower impedances. Even so, in the worst case, into 2 ohms  , the output at 20kHz is down by just 0.2dB. That this is indeed a wide bandwidth design is confirmed by the SM-11S1s excellent reproduction of 1kHz and 10kHz squarewaves  .Fig.1 Marantz SM-11S1, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Marantz SM-11S1, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Marantz SM-11S1, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was excellent, at better than 90dB in both directions below 2kHz, though this decreased to 70dB at 20kHz. The A-weighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms and measured with the input shorted, was to specification, at 101.6dB. It worsened to 63.8dB with a wideband, unweighted measurement, due to the presence of some low-level HF noise.Specified as delivering 110Wpc into 8 ohms or 220Wpc into 4 ohms  , the SM-11S1 easily exceeded those  ures on the test bench, not clipping   until 140Wpc into 8 ohms   and 230Wpc into 4 ohms  . The manner in which the THD+N percentage changed with output power into these two loads is shown in  .4; the distortion is extremely low at all levels below clipping, and actually lies beneath the noise floor below 10W. The amplifier went into protection with sustained delivery of more than 230Wpc into 4 ohms, so I didnt repeat this test into 2 ohms. Plotting how the THD+N  ure changes with frequency   revealed a large increase in measured THD into 2 ohms  , suggesting that this amplifier is indeed uncomfortable driving loads of less than 4 ohms.Fig.4 Marantz SM-11S1, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 4, 8 ohms.Fig.5 Marantz SM-11S1, THD+N   vs frequency at 13.15V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .To be certain that I was looking at distortion rather than noise, I performed this test at the relatively high voltage of 13.15V, which is equivalent to 21.5W into 8 ohms. however, the Marantz offers very low levels of distortion: <0.002% in the midrange and bass into both 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  . The distortion plots show the usual rise in the treble, due to the amplifiers finite open-loop bandwidth reducing the amount of corrective negative feedback at higher frequencies, but the level remains below 0.01%. The left channel was very slightly worse in this respect.Into higher impedances, the content of that distortion is predominantly the benign second harmonic  , though the third harmonic make a stronger appearance as the output current increases  . Even so, both the second and third harmonics lie at or below –100dB  , and though some higher-order harmonics can be seen, these are 10–20dB lower still. Despite the decrease in linearity seen above 5kHz in  .5, the levels of intermodulation products produced with the amplifier driving the demanding 1:1 mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible waveform clipping on an oscilloscope were very low  . As expected from  .5, however, the level of the 1kHz difference tone in the left channel   was a little higher than in the right  .Fig.6 Marantz SM-11S1, 1kHz waveform at 48.5W into 8 ohms  , 0.0103% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Marantz SM-11S1, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 63W into 8 ohms  .Fig.8 Marantz SM-11S1, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 123W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Marantz SM-11S1, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 60W peak into 8 ohms  .Overall, the Marantz SM-11S1 Reference offered a very clean bill of health on the test bench. It was a pleasure to measure an amplifier so competently designed.           ',\n",
       " '  Classé Delta Mono    .   amplifier by operating it at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time, the chassis was cool, at 76.9°F  , though the grille over the rear-mounted fan vent was warmer, at 105.0°F  .The Classés voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 28.7dB from both the balanced and unbalanced inputs and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both input signals. At 86k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, the balanced input impedance was both usefully high and slightly higher than the specified value of 82k ohms. Though the impedance dropped to 70k ohms at 20kHz, this is still high. The unbalanced input impedance was 79k ohms at low and middle frequencies, 35k ohms at the top of the audioband.The Classés output impedance was a low 0.16 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.1875 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, will be negligible, at ±0.15dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was flat to 20kHz and down by 1.5dB at 200kHz, which correlates with the Delta Monos superb reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . Commendably, there was no overshoot or ringing with the squarewave response. Into 2 ohms  , the response was –0.7dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 100kHz.Fig.1 Classé Delta Mono, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Classé Delta Mono, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was an excellent 80.2dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms, this ratio improving to 95dB when the measurement was A-weighted and to 119.8dB when referenced to the amplifiers specified maximum power. Low-level spuriae at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its harmonics were present in the Classés noise floor  , though at –110dB or below  , these are negligible.Fig.3 Classé Delta Mono, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Delta Mono is specified as being able to deliver 300W into 8 ohms and 600W into 4 ohms  , and 1000W into 2 ohms   with the line voltage held constant, all at 0.1% distortion. Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the Classé exceeded its specified powers into 8 ohms, clipping with a 1kHz signal at 380W into 8 ohms   and at 610W into 4 ohms  . The Delta Mono clipped at 950W into 2 ohms  ; however, it is relevant to note that I dont hold the AC wall voltage constant when I test an amplifiers clipping power. With the Delta Mono idling, the wall voltage measured 121.3V. With the amplifier clipping into 2 ohms, the supply voltage had dropped to 117.5V, which is why I found a slight shortfall in maximum power into this load.Fig.4 Classé Delta Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Classé Delta Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Classé Delta Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.I measured how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 20V output, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms—high enough to shift the Delta Monos output stage from class-A into class-AB. The THD+N was very low in the midrange into 8 ohms   but rose into lower impedances  . However, as Sergiu Ignat had said when I interviewed him, the usual increase in THD+N in the top audio octave is absent, confirming that the amplifiers open-loop bandwidth is commendably wide.Fig.7 Classé Delta Mono, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The Delta Monos distortion was predominantly the subjectively benign third harmonic  . This lay at –94dB   at 50Hz into 8 ohms  , and while it rose to –76dB   at the same voltage into 4 ohms  , the higher harmonics are all extremely low in level. When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50W into 8 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz is missing in action and higher-order intermodulation products lay at an extremely low –99dB  .Fig.8 Classé Delta Mono, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0013% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Classé Delta Mono, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Classé Delta Mono, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Classé Delta Mono, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .The Classé Delta Mono performed extremely well on the test bench, a testament to its audio engineering.

       " 'A few seconds after I first powered up Ken Micallefs review sample of the Edge A   it turned itself off, its front-panel light glowing red to indicate a fault. I suspect that, despite the protection afforded by the impressive packaging, the box had been dropped somewhere on its way to me. As Cambridges Dominic Baker was visiting the companys US office, in Chicago, he stopped by my Brooklyn test lab on his way back to the UK with a second sample for me to measure  .This second sample of the Edge A passed its self-test routine, and I measured it    .  ing, I ran it at one-third power into 8 ohms. At the end of that period its heatsinks were hot, at 118.7°F  , and its top panel was warm, at 93.9°F  .Looking first at the line-level analog inputs: With the volume control at its maximum setting, the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 31.5dB from the speaker terminals for the balanced input, and 37.5dB for unbalanced signals.   The maximum gains from the headphone and preamp outputs were a respective 9.2 and 15.25dB. The line inputs preserved absolute polarity   from all outputs. The unbalanced input impedance was 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly to 39.4k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 88k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 83k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone output impedance was a low 10.5 ohms at all audio frequencies. The output impedance at the speaker terminals   was 0.075 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising very slightly to 0.115 ohm at 20kHz. The response was flat into resistive loads  , rolling off above the audioband to reach –3dB above 200kHz, and any modulation of the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was within ±0.05dB  . Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the response didnt change at lower settings of this control. The Cambridges reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   was superbly square, with short risetimes, and no overshoot or ringing apparent.Fig.1 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >110dB in both directions below 2kHz, though this decreased to 80dB at 20kHz. With the analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured a superb 78.5dB. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 91.6dB, and an A-weighting filter increased it further, to 94.3dB.   Levels of any residual spuriae at the AC power-line frequency and its harmonics were almost nonexistent in the right channel  , but some very low-level spurious tones can be seen in the left  .Fig.3 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Edge A is specified as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms   or 200Wpc into 4 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive in both channels the Cambridge exceeded its specification, delivering 145Wpc into 8 ohms   and 230Wpc into 4 ohms  . With one channel driven, the Edge A clipped at 450W into 2 ohms  . The downward slope below 100W in these three graphs indicates that any distortion is actually below the already very low level of noise. Not only is this a very quiet amplifier, it is also a superbly linear one.Fig.4 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.5 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.6 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms, one channel driven.Distortion levels even at 4.6dB below the measured clipping power were very low, and were consistent with both frequency and load impedance, with just a slight rise in the top two audio octaves  . The shape of the spuriae waveform was obscured by noise  , and the distortion signature was almost nonexistent just below half-power into 8 ohms  . At the same voltage into 4 ohms, the third harmonic was the highest in level, at a still-low –99dB in the left channel   and –109dB in the right  . Intermodulation distortion at high powers was also extremely low, even into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, distortion   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.001% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Cambridge Edge A, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the digital inputs, the Cambridges coaxial and optical S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz, and preserved absolute polarity. Apples USB Prober utility identified the Edge A as \"CA Edge 2.0\" from \"CA,\" and confirmed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the Edge As USB port could handle 16- and 24-bit integer data at all sample rates up to 705.6kHz. A 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in an output level of 14.4V into 8 ohms with the volume control at its maximum setting, which suggests that the digital inputs have about 12dB too much gain; ie, a digital signal at –8dB with the volume control up full will just drive the amplifier into clipping into 8 ohms.The Cambridges impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that its reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing to either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise   the Edge As response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression just above the Nyquist frequency of 22.05kHz  . An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   can be just seen at –115dB. The distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor, the highest in level being the third, at –84dB  .Fig.12 Cambridge Edge A, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.13 Cambridge Edge A, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .When  Edge As digital frequency response with S/PDIF data at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz, the response followed the same basic shape, with a sharp rolloff just below the two lower sample rates  . When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor dropped by about 18dB, meaning that the Edge A offers around 18 bits worth of resolution. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical.

       " 'Because the CH Precision M1.1 is so heavy  , I drove the 45 miles to Michael Fremers home    , cables, noninductive power resistors, and analog and digital oscilloscopes, and I set up everything on a table in his garage. Because I knew from experience that the AC outlets in the garage are on a circuit with a 15A breaker, I ran two long extension cables—one for the test gear, one for the amplifier, which has two AC cords—to an outlet in the house that has a 20A circuit.  with one of the two amplifiers con ured as Michael had done for his auditioning: \"Monaural\" mode, 0dB gain adjust, 20% global negative feedback, and driven via the balanced input. I repeated some of the tests with the high-impedance unbalanced input and with 0% and 100% negative feedback  . , I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone for an hour at one-third power into 8 ohms, which is the most thermally stressful condition for an amplifier with a class-AB output stage. Because of time constraints, however,   M1.1 for 15 minutes. At the end of that time, the top panel was slightly warm at 82.4°F  ; aiming my infrared thermometer through the slots in the top panel at the heatsinks, the temperature was 101.5°F  . I continued to monitor temperature, but the amplifier didnt get any warmer throughout the testing.The voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 23.5dB for the balanced input, but, unusually, 6dB higher from the unbalanced input. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  ; the XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot. The balanced input impedance was a usefully high 90k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping inconsequentially to 58k ohms at 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance was 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 21k ohms at 20kHz.The output impedance with 100% feedback, including a 6-long, spaced-pair speaker cable, was a low 0.1 ohms across the audioband. With 20% feedback, it rose to 0.24 ohm at low and middle frequencies, and 0.27 ohm at the top of the audioband. But when I started to measure the CH amplifiers small-signal frequency response, I realized that I had left my standard simulated loudspeaker at home. However, this output impedance should result in the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response with this load by close to ±0.25dB. The M1.1s frequency response into 8 ohms   was flat to 20kHz and down by just 0.5dB at 60kHz; a 10kHz squarewave was therefore reproduced with very short risetimes  . A 1kHz squarewave was perfectly square  . Though the ultrasonic output rolls off a little earlier into lower impedances, the response into 2 ohms   was down by just 0.3dB at 20kHz.Fig.1 CH Precision M1.1, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 CH Precision M1.1, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced input shorted to ground and ref. 1W into 8 ohms, was 76.4dB, improving to 83.6dB with the measurement bandwidth restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 89.3dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor   indicated that there were AC power-supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, these presumably due to magnetic interference from the huge power transformer. Other than the spectral components at 60Hz and 180Hz, which were at a still-low –93dB and –97dB, these spuriae all lay close to –110dB  , and the random noise-floor components were all extremely low in level.Fig.3 CH Precision M1.1, spectrum, DC–1kHz, ref. 1W into 8 ohms  .When I started testing the amplifiers output power, I fed the balanced input at 1kHz tone at 188mV, which resulted in exactly 1W into 8 ohms; the M1.1s meter read 2.3W.4 In its mono mode, the CH M1.1s maximum output is specified as 200W into 8 ohms  , 350W into 4 ohms  , and 600W into 2 ohms  . With clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1% and with the M1.1 set to 20% feedback, I measured a clipping power of 260W into 8 ohms  . Increasing the feedback to 100% gave the same clipping power  , but the distortion is very much lower at all powers below 200W into 8 ohms. Into 4 ohms I measured 440W   and into 2 ohms 700W  . I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests; it dropped from 122.5V AC with the amplifier idling to 118.5V AC at the measured clipping power into 2 ohms. The shortfall in maximum output power will not be an issue with typical loudspeakers and rooms, but it did puzzle me.Fig.4 CH Precision M1.1, 20% NFB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 CH Precision M1.1, 100% NFB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 CH Precision M1.1, 20% NFB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 CH Precision M1.1, 20% NFB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The traces in Figs. 4–7 suggested I examine how the M1.1s percentage of THD+N varied with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. With 100% feedback  , the percentage of THD+N was extremely low into 8 ohms and 4 ohms in the bass and midrange, with the rise in the treble due to the decrease in open-loop voltage gain as the frequency increases. However, into 2 ohms  , the amplifiers distortion was 10 times higher in the midrange than it was into 8 ohms and even higher at low frequencies. Repeating the test with 20% feedback, which is how Michael did all his auditioning, the THD+N was higher into 4 and 8 ohms   but similar to the 100% feedback behavior into 2 ohms  . Even so, it still lay below 0.1% below 10kHz.Fig.8 CH Precision M1.1, 100% NFB, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .Fig.9 CH Precision M1.1, 20% NFB, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The THD+N waveform with 20% feedback at 100Wpc into 8 ohms   indicates that while the distortion was low, at 0.018%, there were higher-order components present. With a low-frequency tone at 100Wpc into 8 ohms  , the second and third harmonics were the highest in level, at –93dB   and –87dB  , respectively, with many higher-order harmonics visible. Repeating the analysis with 100% feedback   kept the third harmonic at the same level, but the second harmonic dropped by 10dB and the higher-order products almost disappeared.Fig.10 CH Precision M1.1, 20% NFB, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.018% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 CH Precision M1.1, 20% NFB, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 CH Precision M1.1, 100% NFB, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .The reduced linearity of the M1.1s circuit at high frequencies meant that when tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, the amplifier produced relatively high levels of intermodulation distortion, even at moderate powers  . The difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB   with many higher-order products present. This graph was taken with 20% feedback; increasing the feedback to 100% gave a much cleaner spectrum  .Fig.13 CH Precision M1.1, 20% NFB, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.14 CH Precision M1.1, 100% NFB, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .The CH Precision M1.1 is a powerful amplifier, but its measured performance is heavily dependent on the amount of global negative feedback selected. A measurement freak such as I would choose 100% feedback, but I note that Michael found 20% feedback to be the sweet spot when it came to the M1.1s sound quality. And note that no matter the percentage of feedback, this amplifier is more comfortable driving impedances higher than 2 ohms. Footnote 1: The CH Precision M1.1 features the same adjustable global negative feedback as the companys I1 integrated amplifier, which Jason Victor Serinus reviewed in February 2019. You can read my measurements of this amplifier here.Footnote 2: CH Precision says the meter on the M1.1 shows peak power, not RMS power; the rest of the discrepancy they attribute to a measuring technique that avoids adding components in series with the output signal.

       " 'Sidebar 5: 860 Measurements s on the Boulder 860 power amplifier,  running both channels for 60 minutes into 8 ohms at one-third the specified power. The THD+N was just 0.001% with the amplifier cold, and was unchanged at the end of the preconditioning. The top panel was below 60°C after 60 minutes, which suggests that the 860 has sufficient thermal heatsink efficiency for its power rating. Like the 810 preamplifier, the 860 was non-inverting and wired with pin 2 of its XLR jacks hot. It offered a voltage gain of 25.8dB into 8 ohms, and its input impedance measured 91k ohms at low and medium frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 60k ohms at 20kHz.At just 0.07 ohm, the output impedance was very low over most of the audioband, rising insignificantly to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modification of the 860s frequency response due to the usual Ohms Law interaction between this impedance and that of the loudspeaker was very small, at ±0.1dB  . The output was flat within the audioband into 8 ohms, and down 3dB at a high 100kHz into that load. Into 2 ohms  , a very slight, –0.35dB droop appeared at 20kHz. The 10kHz squarewave response was commendably square  .Fig.6 Boulder 860, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Boulder 860, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was better than 100dB in both directions below 10kHz  , with the A-weighted S/N ratio   an excellent 99.2dBA. It was a still-excellent 89.1dB with a wideband, unweighted measurement.As shown by  .8, the Boulder 860 more than met its specified power, with 210W continuously available at clipping into 8 ohms  , 338W into 4 ohms  , and 455W into 2 ohms  . However, the amplifier went into protection a few seconds after reaching 455W into 2 ohms. It returned to normal operation once Id backed off the drive signal. As with the 810, the downward slope toward the left of this graph indicates that the THD is actually buried beneath the amplifiers noise at levels below 20W or so. I therefore looked at how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 10V output, which is equivalent to 12.5W into 8 ohms, 25W into 4 ohms, and 50W into 2 ohms  . The THD is vanishingly low into all loads below 1kHz, but rises slightly at high frequencies due to the usual reduction in the circuits open-loop bandwidth in this region.Fig.8 Boulder 860, right channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.9 Boulder 860, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms  .As well as being very low in level, the THD was predominantly low-order harmonics, even at high powers  , while intermodulation distortion was also very low, even at a level close to clipping into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Boulder 860, 1kHz waveform at 95W into 8 ohms  , 0.00084% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Boulder 860, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.12 Boulder 860, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 260W peak into 4 ohms  .Both the Boulder 810 and 860 offer superb measured performance and are well engineered. I found no clue in the measurements as to why FK liked the preamplifier but was less impressed by the power amplifier. It is always possible that there was a compatibility issue with Freds speakers and/or cables. I therefore auditioned the 860 with the Sonus Faber Elipsa loudspeakers that I review elsewhere in this issue using the \"system described in that report. While I agree with Fred on the amplifiers rather loose quality at low frequencies, I found the Boulders high frequencies to be silky smooth, without any trace of the upper midrange being a bit glaring or violins sounding \"steely,\" even on the same Andrew Manze Bach recording that Fred mentioned. I also found the image depth thrown by the amplifier quite extraordinary, as did Fred.As Wes Phillips had already auditioned the Boulder 860 in FKs system and heard what Fred had heard, I asked him to take a listen to the amplifier in his system. He reports on his findings in the sidebar to the main review.           ',\n",
       " 'A much-touted benefit of an amplifier with a class-D output stage is that it can be smaller and much lighter than a conventional amplifier for a given power. I was surprised, therefore, when I unpacked LKVs Veros PWR+ to find that it was both large and heavy. This is because the amplifier uses a linear power supply with three hefty transformers rather than a switch-mode supply  .  Veros PWR+    . As the LKV has a class-D output stage, it wasnt necessary to precondition the amplifier by using it to drive a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms. Nevertheless, before doing any testing I ran it for an hour at a moderate power level, following which the top panel was warm, at 93.9°F/34.4°C. Because class-D amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slew-rate limiting, all   with an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz. Without the filter, 218mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the loudspeaker terminals.The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 27dB from both the balanced and single-ended inputs, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both inputs. The single-ended input impedance was a commendably high 165k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still-high 84k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was more than twice these values, at 358k ohms at 20Hz, 334k ohms at 1kHz, and 268k ohms at 20kHz.The LKVs output impedance, including the series impedance of 6 of loudspeaker cable, was a very low 0.07 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz. It increased very slightly to 0.09 ohm at 20kHz. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore negligible at less than ±0.1dB  . The response into resistive loads was flat to 20kHz into 8 ohms but rolled off rapidly above the audioband, reaching –3dB at 60kHz  . These responses were taken with the balanced inputs; the unbalanced inputs behaved identically. The restricted ultrasonic response is responsible for slightly lengthened risetimes with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . There is also a small amount of overshoot with the squarewave reproduction, with one critically damped cycle of ringing. Presumably, this is mainly due to the class-D output stages integral low-pass filter.Fig.1 LKV Veros PWR+, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 LKV Veros PWR+, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent in the L–R direction, at >90dB below 3kHz, but was up to 20dB worse in the R–L direction. Measured with the Audio Precision ultrasonic filter and the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured an excellent 80.6dB in the left channel and 79.9dB in the right. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratios to 91.6dB, left, and 86.3dB, right, and an A-weighting filter increased them further, to 94.8dB, left, and 91.5dB, right. Spectral analysis of the LKV amplifiers low-frequency noise floor   revealed that spuriae related to the AC power-line frequency were very low in level but were a little higher in the right channel   than the left  .Fig.3 LKV Veros PWR+, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Veros PWR+ is specified as delivering 200Wpc into 8 ohms and 400Wpc into 4 ohms, both equivalent to 23dBW. At our usual definition of clipping, which is when the THD+noise reaches 1%, the LKV amplifier with both channels driven exceeded its specified power into 8 ohms, clipping at 221Wpc  . It clipped at 400Wpc into 4 ohms  , and with one channel driven, I measured a clipping power of 505W into 2 ohms  . This contrasts with the specified maximum 2 ohm power of 220W into 2 ohms    .Fig.4 LKV Veros PWR+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 LKV Veros PWR+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 LKV Veros PWR+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Distortion levels were very low  , but less so in the right channel   than the left channel   even into 2 ohms  . However, the level of the THD declined above 10kHz, perhaps due to the output stages low-pass filter. The shape of the THD+N spuriae waveform at a moderate power into 8 ohms   suggests that the distortion signature is predominantly third-harmonic in nature. This was confirmed by spectral analysis  , though at a moderate power into 4 ohms, the third harmonic was higher in the right channel   than it was in the left  . Intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones was also very low in level  .Fig.7 LKV Veros PWR+, THD+N   vs frequency at 15.5V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .Fig.8 LKV Veros PWR+, 1kHz waveform at 30W into 8 ohms, 0.0074% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 LKV Veros PWR+, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 30Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 LKV Veros PWR+, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 60Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 LKV Veros PWR+, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 60Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .The LKV Veros PWR+ turned in excellent measured performance. Footnote 1: See, for example, Tom Gibbss review of the Bel Canto e1X amplifier in June 2020.Footnote 2: In an email, Bill Hutchins wrote \"John noted that the max output power into 2 ohms   contrasts with our spec of 220W into 2 ohms  . Because the amps maximum power output is current-limited into 2 ohms, Johns 505W measurement converts to about 250W if both channels are driven with the same sinewave signal. Thus, his measurement and our spec are in rough agreement.\"          ',\n",
       " '  Primare A35.2    . As the A35.2 has a class-D output stage, I didnt perform my usual preconditioning by operating the amplifier at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour. With a class-AB output stage, one-third power results in the maximum dissipation in the output devices, but this is not relevant with a class-D design. However, because class-D amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slew-rate limiting, all   with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz. Without the filter, there was 433mV of ultrasonic noise present at the loudspeaker terminals.The Primares voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 25.8dB from the single-ended inputs and, unusually, 19.8dB from the balanced inputs.   The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both balanced and unbalanced input signals. The balanced input impedance was 13k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance was 14.7k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 13.5k ohms at the top of the audioband.The A35.2s output impedance was a very low 0.067 ohm at all audio frequencies.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore minuscule, at ±0.1dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was flat to 20kHz, with then a steep rolloff. The Primares reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured a single damped cycle of ringing, this presumably due to the output stages integral low-pass filter.Fig.1 Primare A35.2, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Primare A35.2, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >90dB in both directions below 2kHz, reducing to a still-good 72dB at the top of the audioband. Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and with the auxiliary low-pass filter in-circuit, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 52.6dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms in both channels. This ratio improved to 73.3dB when I restricted the measurement bandwidth to the audioband, and to 76dB when the reading was A-weighted. Low-level spuriae at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its odd harmonics were vanishingly low in level in the Primares low-frequency noise floor  . However, a pair of spurious tones of unknown origin were present around 500Hz, these low in level but a little higher in the right channel   than the left  .Fig.3 Primare A35.2, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Primare specifies the A35.2 as delivering 200W into 8 ohms and 400W into 4 ohms. Both powers are equivalent to 23dBW, which implies that the Primare amplifier behaves as a perfect voltage source. Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the Primare exceeded its specified powers. With both channels driven with a 1kHz signal, it clipped at 225Wpc into 8 ohms   and at 460Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.4 Primare A35.2, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.The distortion at low powers in  s.4 and 5 was below the level of the noise floor, so I examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was very low in the midrange into 8, 4, and 2 ohms  , but rose at higher frequencies. The Primare amplifiers distortion at 50W into 8 ohms was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second and third harmonics  , these each lying at just –100dB  . The second harmonic increased slightly at the same voltage into 4 ohms but was joined by the fifth and seventh harmonics  . When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay below –100dB   and higher-order intermodulation products were not much higher in level.Fig.5 Primare A35.2, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Primare A35.2, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms   2 ohms  .Fig.7 Primare A35.2, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0025% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Primare A35.2, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Primare A35.2, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Primare A35.2, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .The Primare A35.2 offers respectable measured performance, with superb matching between the channels.

       " '  was taken in the Accuphase M-2000s balanced mode, with selected measurements repeated in the unbalanced con uration. Unless otherwise noted, the measurements presented here are of balanced operation.Following the M-2000s 1/3-power, one-hour preconditioning test, its heatsinks were merely warm. The input impedance measured 49.4k ohms  . The output impedance was a extremely low 0.035 ohm at 1kHz, increasing to a measured maximum of 0.038 ohm at 20Hz into an 8 ohm load, and 0.063 ohm at 20kHz into 4 ohms. Such low values indicate that the amplifiers frequency response into actual loudspeaker impedances should be the same.The amplifiers voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 28dB as specified, balanced and unbalanced. DC offset fluctuated between 0.0 and 0.1mV—essentially unmeasurable. Signal to noise   measured 95.2dB over a 22Hz–22kHz bandwidth and 88.1dB over 10Hz–500kHz, both unweighted, and 97.4dB A-weighted. The corresponding unbalanced S/N measurements were 93.7dB, 87.5dB, and 95.6dB.The M-2000 is noninverting from its unbalanced input. In balanced mode, pin 3 is positive.  Fig.1 shows the M-2000s frequency response. It is very flat across most of the audible range, with an audibly insignificant rise of less than 0.2dB from 20kHz to 30kHz. The unbalanced response   was essentially identical. The small-signal 10kHz squarewave response in  .2 is respectable. There is a slight overshoot at the leading edge, but no ringing, and a good risetime. This overshoot is also visible in the otherwise excellent 1kHz squarewave performance  .Fig.1 Accuphase M-2000, balanced, frequency response at  : 2W into 4 ohms, 1W into 8 ohms, and 2.828V into simulated loudspeaker load,  .Fig.2 Accuphase M-2000, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The THD+noise vs frequency result   shows exceptionally low distortion below 10kHz, with some increase at higher frequencies. The only exception is into a 2 ohm load, where the distortion rises significantly at high frequencies, if still to only slightly above 0.1%—arguably, an audibly insignificant level. To get a recognizable distortion waveform out of the noise, I had to use a higher output level than normal. Fig.4, at 20W into 2 ohms, indicates that the distortion is predominantly third-order, though higher-order components are also present. The result is similar at 10W into 4 ohms  , though the noise is more evident due to the lower level of the distortion. At 20W into 8 ohms   the predominant harmonic becomes second-order, with some evidence of higher-order harmonics plus noise.Fig.3 Accuphase M-2000, THD+noise   vs frequency at  : 4W into 2 ohms, balanced; 2W into 4 ohms, balanced; 2W into 4 ohms, unbalanced; 2.83V into simulated loudspeaker load, balanced; 1W into 8 ohms, unbalanced; and 1W into 8 ohms, balanced.Fig.4 Accuphase M-2000, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 2 ohms  , distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .The M-2000s output spectrum to a 50Hz input at 335W output into 4 ohms is shown in  .5. This is a superb result; all of the distortion components are well below –90dB  . Measuring the intermodulation products resulting from an input signal consisting of an equal combination of 19kHz and 20kHz  , also at 335W into 4 ohms, proved an exercise of equal frustration: All of the artifacts are at or below –80dB  . The same is true for the measurement taken at 168W into 8 ohms  .Fig.5 Accuphase M-2000, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 335W into 4 ohms  .Fig.6 Accuphase M-2000, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–22kHz, 19+20kHz at 335W into 4 ohms  .The 1kHz, THD+noise percentage vs power curves for the M-2000 are shown in  .7. Because of the amplifiers extremely high power output and the limitations of our test load, no attempt was made to measure the M-2000s continuous power into 2 ohms. The amplifier clipped   at 439W   into 8 ohms  , and at 774W   into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Accuphase M-2000, distortion   vs continuous output power into   8 ohms and 4 ohms.John Atkinson used the Miller Amplifier Profiler to examine the M-200s output power on a slow-duty-cycle 1kHz toneburst, which is more like a typical music waveform. The results are shown in  .8. Specified at a continuous 250W into 8 ohms, the Accuphase actually didnt clip until 524W  , with 1007W available into 4 ohms  , 1938W  , and 3602W  ! The distortion level remained low into all these loads until reaching the distortion \"knee.\"  Fig.8 Accuphase M-2000, distortion   vs 1kHz burst output power into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , and 1 ohm  .The Accuphase M-2000s test-bench measurements were outstanding, the only possible exceptions being the slight squarewave overshoot and the distortion into a 2 ohm load—and those stand out not because theyre particularly bad, but only because of the exceptional performance surrounding them in all other respects.—Thomas J.

       " '  Pass Laboratories XA25    .  s, I ran it at one-third its clipping power   into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time, the top panel was warm, at 102.3°F  , and the heatsink fins were hotter, at 122.2°F  . The gain at the speaker terminals was to spec at 20.4dB, and the output preserved absolute polarity  .The XA25s unbalanced input impedance was the specified 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 34k ohms at the top of the audioband. The output impedance   was low, at 0.08 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising very slightly to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the variation in frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker was small: less than ±0.1dB  . Fig.1 shows that the XA25s frequency response is wide, with a –3dB point at almost 200kHz. The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave therefore has very short risetimes  , and there is no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Pass Labs XA25, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Pass Labs XA25, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was >90dB in both directions below 3kHz, decreasing to 76dB at 20kHz, and with its lower-than-usual gain, the XA25s unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratios were correspondingly superb, at 91.2dB left and 88.4dB right. Both ratios increased to 94.6dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 97.3dB when A-weighted. Fig.3 reveals that the primary source of noise is spuriae at the AC wall frequency of 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, these presumably due to magnetic interference from the power transformer.Fig.3 Pass Labs XA25, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Pass Labs specifies the XA25s output power as 25Wpc into 8 ohms and 50Wpc into 4 ohms  . However, as you can see in  s. 4 and 5, the amplifier exceeded its specified power output at the clipping point, which we define as when the THD+noise equals 1%. At that THD+N percentage the XA25 delivered 80Wpc into 8 ohms   and 130Wpc into 4 ohms  . It appears from the shape of the traces in these graphs that Pass specifies the XA25s power as when the THD+N is close to 0.01%.Fig.4 Pass Labs XA25, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Pass Labs XA25, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.At moderate powers the XA25 offered low levels of distortion, but as you can see in  .6, which plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at 8.9V—equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms, 20W into 4 ohms, and 40W into 2 ohms—the distortion did rise at higher frequencies, especially into lower impedances. This graph suggests that the XA25 not be used with loudspeakers with an impedance that drops below 4 ohms in the treble.Fig.6 Pass Labs XA25, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the distortion in the midrange was predominantly the relatively innocuous third harmonic  , though at low frequencies the second harmonic was equal in level to the third  . But note the very low level of all distortion harmonics in this graph! Nelson Pass had warned me that measuring the XA25s intermodulation distortion with my usual twin-tone test signal would be problematic: \"The bias circuit we are using interprets continuous high-power, high-frequency tones as a fault. If you want to do high-power, high-frequency IM test tones, you will need to do them quickly or you will get falsely high readings.\" In my spectral analyses, I usually average 32 readings to ensure that the distortion products are not obscured by noise; for the XA25 I averaged just four readings, not turning on the test signal until I was ready to take the reading. At a moderate power level into 8 ohms, the intermodulation distortion was very low  , the IM products all lying close to –90dB ref. the peak signal level. When I tried to repeat this test into 4 ohms, the amplifiers protection circuit kicked in as soon as I turned on the signal generator.Fig.7 Pass Labs XA25, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.0027% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Pass Labs XA25, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Pass Labs XA25, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms  .Overall, the XA25 performed well on the test bench, as Ive come to expect from Pass Labs.           ',\n",
       " 'I measured NADs Masters Series M33    . Usually, before I test an amplifier, I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. This thermally stresses an amplifier with a conventional class-AB output stage, but as the NAD is a class-D design, this wasnt necessary. However, before doing any testing I ran the M33 for an hour to ensure that it was fully warmed up. At the end of that time, the top panel was slightly warm, at 100.7°F/38.2°C. Because class-D amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slew-rate limiting, all measurements other than the frequency response and squarewave tests were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates the ultrasonic noise.Looking first at the analog inputs: With the NADs volume control set to its maximum of \"0.0dB,\" the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 33.3dB at the speaker terminals with both balanced and unbalanced inputs. The maximum gain at the headphone output was 9.4dB and at the preamplifier output was 5.3dB. The line inputs preserved absolute polarity   at all three sets of outputs. The single-ended input impedance was a usefully high 50k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly to 36k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedances were twice these values, as expected, except at 20kHz, where it was 92k ohms. The headphone output impedance was a very low 2.8 ohms rather than the specified 22 ohms. At the preamplifier outputs, the impedance was an appropriately low 100 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz, rising slightly but inconsequentially to 124 ohms at 20Hz.The M33s output impedance at the speaker terminals was a low 0.08 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz.   Fig.1 shows the frequency response at the speaker outputs, with the M33s A/D converter set to its maximum sample rate of 192kHz. Unlike the M32, where a peak developed at the top of the audioband, especially into higher load impedances  , the M33s audioband output is flat and rolls off above 20kHz, reaching –3dB at 55kHz. However, note the imbalance between the channels, with the left channel   0.6dB higher in level than the right  .   With the amplifiers very low output impedance, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   varies by just ±0.05dB. Measured at the preamplifier and headphone outputs with the A/D converter set to 96kHz, the response extends to just above 40kHz, but a slight amount of passband ripple can be seen  .Fig.1 NAD M33, analog input, volume control at 0.0dB, sample rate set at 192kHz, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 NAD M33, analog input, sample rate set at 96kHz, frequency response at preamplifier output at 1V into 100k ohms    .Fig.3 shows the effect of the M33s bass and treble controls set to their maximum and minimum positions and with the converter sample rate set to 96kHz. Both controls offer a sensible range of ±6dB, as specified. With the tone controls bypassed and without the external Audio Precision low-pass filter, the M33s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured a slight, critically damped overshoot.  Fig.3 NAD M33, analog input, sample rate set at 96kHz, tone control response at 1V into 8 ohms with Bass and Treble controls set to \"0,\" \"+6,\" and \"–6\"    .Channel separation was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 1kHz, decreasing to 72dB at 20kHz. Without the AP low-pass filter and with no signal present, about 220mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the speaker outputs. With the filter, the single-ended analog inputs shorted to ground, and with the volume control set to \"0.0dB,\" the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratios   were significantly better than those of the M32, at 75.8dB in the left channel and 73.8dB in the right. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratios to 85.4dB, left, and 78.3dB, right, and an A-weighting filter increased both to 91.5dB. Levels of any residuals at the AC power-line frequency and its harmonics were negligible  .Fig.4 NAD M33, analog input, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.5 NAD M33, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The M33 is specified as clipping at 210Wpc into 8 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive and both channels driven, the M33 exceeded the specified 8 ohm power, delivering 255Wpc  . NAD doesnt specify the continuous clipping power into 4 ohms; I measured 460Wpc into 4 ohms  . This is an approximate  ure, as the amplifiers protection circuit operated intermittently at powers above 400W.Fig.6 NAD M33, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 NAD M33, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The shape of the traces in  s.6 and 7 reveals that any distortion lies below the noise levels at powers below a few tens of watts. I therefore investigated how the THD+noise varied with frequency at a level of 20V, equivalent to 50Wpc into 8 ohms and 100Wpc into 4 ohms. Distortion levels were very low in both channels into 8 ohms  , but into 4 ohms were higher in the right channel   than the left  . The shape of the spuriae waveform at 100Wpc into 4 ohms   suggests that the distortion signature is primarily third-harmonic in nature; this harmonic was higher in the right channel   than the left  . Intermodulation distortion at high powers was low even into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 NAD M33, analog input, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.9 NAD M33, analog input, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.0013% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 NAD M33, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 NAD M33, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the digital inputs, a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in an output level of 9.62V into 8 ohms with the volume control set to \"0.0dB,\" which suggests that these inputs have too much gain: A full-scale digital signal would result in an output voltage thats far beyond clipping.   The levels at the preamplifier and headphone outputs at –20dBFS were 382mV and 607.5mV, indicating that a digital signal at 0dBFS will not clip these outputs. To avoid damaging the M33s output stage with full-scale digital signals,   behavior of the digital inputs at the headphone output, which mutes the speaker outputs.  The AES/EBU and coaxial and optical S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz. The NADs impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the M33s response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression just above half the sample rate  . An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   cant therefore be seen, though the distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor, the third harmonic being the highest in level at just –86dB  .Fig.12 NAD M33, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.13 NAD M33, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor on average dropped by almost 30dB, though the floor with 24-bit data was rather dirty-looking. The M33 offers at least 20 bits of resolution, therefore, which is excellent for an integrated amplifiers digital section. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved, and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a clean sinewave  .Fig.14 NAD M33, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.15 NAD M33, digital input, waveform of undithered 16-bit, 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS  .Fig.16 NAD M33, digital input, waveform of undithered 24-bit, 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS  .The NADs rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit TosLink data   was superb, with all the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave at the correct levels  . With 24-bit J-Test data  , no jitter-related sidebands were present. The M33 replaces the M32s USB input with an Ethernet port. Repeating the jitter testing with data sourced over my network with Roon revealed no differences from the measured performance with S/PDIF and AES/EBU data.Fig.17 NAD M33, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit Toslink data  .

Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.I set the M33s A/D converter to a sample rate of 192kHz for the phono input measurements.    behavior of the phono input at the headphone output, as in MC mode, with the inputs level adjust set to \"0.0dB,\" the possibility existed of driving the loudspeaker outputs into clipping. The maximum gain in MC mode was a very high 90.6dB at the speaker outputs, 62.3dB at the preamplifier outputs, and 66.4dB at the headphone outputs. In MM mode, the maximum gains were 68.6dB  , 40.34dB  , and 44.4dB  . The MM gains are all appropriate for typical moving-magnet phono cartridges, but the MC gain is a little on the high side.Both MM and MC modes preserve absolute polarity. In MM mode, the input impedance was slightly low, at 26k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 23.5k ohms at 20kHz. In MC mode, the input impedance was an appropriately low 127 ohms across the audioband. The RIAA error was both very low and well-matched between channels  , and channel separation was excellent at >80dB in both directions from 20Hz to 20kHz. In MM mode, the phono inputs wide-band, unweighted S/N ratio, ref. 1kHz at 5mV, was excellent at 69.75dB, this improving to 80.2dB when A-weighted. In MC mode, the unweighted S/N ratios were about 9dB lower than in MM mode but a still good 61.1dB when A-weighted.Fig.19 NAD M33, phono input, response with RIAA correction  .The phono inputs overload margins were also excellent, at 18dB across the audioband in MM mode and 16.4dB in MC mode. In every case, the 1% THD+noise  ure was equivalent to the headphone output clipping at just over 6V into 100k ohms. Both harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion were extremely low via the phono input. In MM mode with a 1kHz signal at 20mV, ie, 12dB higher than the nominal 5mV level, the third harmonic was the highest in level, but still it lay at just –100dB  .Like its predecessor, NADs M33 packs a lot of well-engineered performance into its relatively small chassis. It improves on the M32s performance in several areas. Footnote 1: See  .1 here.Footnote 2: NAD specifies clipping power at a more conservative 0.1% THD.          ',\n",
       " 'One mbl Reference 9007 amplifier   was preconditioned in balanced monoblock mode by running it at one-third the specified clipping power into 8 ohms for one hour. At the end of that period, the heatsinks were just too hot to keep my hand on, implying a temperature of around 60°C; the chassis was much cooler. The initial THD+noise  ure at this power level was 0.016%; after 60 minutes, this had dropped very slightly, to 0.013%.The 9007s voltage gain into 8 ohms was 27dB in both balanced   and single-ended   modes, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity; ie, was non-inverting in both modes. Both balanced and unbalanced input impedances were to specification at all audio frequencies, at 20k ohms and 10k ohms, respectively. The output impedance for mono operation was a little on the high side for a solid-state design, at 0.33 ohm at low and middle frequencies, 0.38 ohm at 20kHz. This is to be expected for a balanced design in which the output impedances of the two amplifier halves are effectively in series. The 9007s output impedance in single-ended, stereo mode was exactly half this  ure, as anticipated.With this highish output impedance, the mbl 9007s frequency response into our standard simulated speaker load   featured some ±0.3dB of variation. This was halved when the amplifier was used in stereo mode  . The 9007s small-signal bandwidth can be seen from this graph to be very wide, with a –3dB point at 200kHz into 8 ohms. The bandwidth decreased a little into lower impedances, with a very slight degree of top-octave rolloff into 2 ohms. The single-ended bandwidth   was even wider, with the output into 8 ohms down by just 1.65dB at 200kHz. As a result of this wide bandwidth, the 9007s reproduction of 1kHz and 10kHz squarewaves   was superb, with no hint of overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 mbl 9007, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.2 mbl 9007, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 mbl 9007, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Used as a stereo amplifier, the 9007 met its specified output power, with the clipping points   of: 137W into 8 ohms  , 231W into 4 ohms  , and 396W into 2 ohms  . As can be seen in  .4, the distortion was very low in level before clipping, especially into 8 ohms. The upward slope of the traces with decreasing power below 10–20W in this graph is due to the fact that the actual distortion is below the noise floor in this region. Fig.5 plots the THD+N percentage against output power for balanced mono operation. The clipping power has increased significantly, to 444W into 8 ohms  , 600W into 4 ohms  , but 515W into 2 ohms  . The distortion also starts to rise at lower powers than with single-ended operation; however, even in the worst case, into 2 ohms, it remains below 0.1% below 150W.Fig.4 mbl 9007, single-ended distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.5 mbl 9007, balanced distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.As MF noted, the 9007 is a very quiet amplifier: its wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms in balanced mode, was 90.9dB, increasing to 100.6dB when A-weighted. In conjunction with the very high power, this low noise floor endows the mbl with a greater dynamic range than almost any other amplifier that has passed through my test lab. In  .6, I plotted how the balanced THD+N percentage varies with frequency at 5V output, which is where the actual distortion starts to rise out of the noise floor. Though the distortion rises with decreasing load impedance, it is very low in level and doesnt change with frequency, which suggests that the 9007s circuit has a very wide open-loop bandwidth.Fig.6 mbl 9007, balanced THD+N  vs frequency at 5V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.In addition to the low level of the distortion, its content is predominantly the subjectively benign third harmonic  . Note the low levels of even-order harmonics in  .8, which suggest that the characteristics of the two amplifiers comprising the balanced 9007 are closely matched. This graph was taken into 8 ohms; into 4 ohms  , the third harmonic rises only slightly, by 4dB, to –70dB  —but the second harmonic rises from –90dB   to –80dB  . No power-supply–related spuriae appear in any of these high-power spectra, however, suggesting that the 9007s power supply is up to the demands made of it. Finally, even just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen, the 9007 produced low levels of intermodulation distortion  .Fig.7 mbl 9007, balanced 1kHz waveform at 28W into 4 ohms  , 0.0175% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 mbl 9007, balanced spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 250W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 mbl 9007, balanced HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 420W peak into 4 ohms  .I love measuring an amplifier that is as well-engineered as the mbl 9007. But there is nothing in its measured performance, other than the much higher output power, that would indicate why Michael Fremer preferred its sound in balanced mono mode.           ',\n",
       " '  M28      . As the Bricasti amplifier is specified as having a maximum output power of 200W into 8 ohms,   it before the measurements by running it at one-third that power, 67W, into 8 ohms for an hour, following which the top panel was warm, at 99.3°F  , and the side panel covering the internal heatsink was only slightly hotter, at 106.7°F  . The THD+noise percentage at this power level was 0.0017% with the amplifier cold, 0.002% with it fully warm.The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 26.9dB with a balanced input signal, 26.65dB with an unbalanced signal, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity   for both inputs. The rear-panel level-trim control applied three attenuation steps, each of 6.1dB. The unbalanced input impedance was a usefully high 88k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping slightly to 36k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedances were twice these values, as expected. The output impedance, including 6 of speaker cable, was very low, at 0.05 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.06 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the variation in response due to the interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker   was just ±0.05dB  . The response was perfectly flat in the audioband, and down by 3dB at 180kHz into 8 ohms  . As a result, the M28s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was essentially perfect, with no overshoot or ringing  . Fig.1 was taken with balanced drive; with unbalanced drive  , the response had a small, +0.18dB plateau in the treble, and the ultrasonic output rolled off a little earlier than with a balanced input signal.Fig.1 Bricasti M28, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Bricasti M28, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Bricasti M28, unbalanced frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms  .The Bricasti M28 is a very quiet amplifier. Its unweighted wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted, was 80.5dB, improving to 84.7dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband, and to 85.7dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the amplifiers low-frequency noise floor while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms   revealed that the power-supply–related spuriae were 60Hz and its odd harmonics—generally due to magnetic interference from the power transformer—but even the highest in level lay at just –110dB  .Fig.4 Bricasti M28, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 5 and 6 plot the percentage of THD+noise against output power into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. With clipping defined as the point at which the THD+N reaches 1%, the M28 exceeded its specified power of 200W into 8 ohms  , clipping at 250W  . Into 4 ohms, the Bricasti amplifier clipped at 490W  . When   clipping behavior into 2 ohms, the M28s protection circuit operated at 128W into that load  . Turning the amplifier off and on again restored normal operation.Fig.5 Bricasti M28, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Bricasti M28, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Bricasti M28, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The downward slope of the traces below 10W or so in  s. 5 and 6 suggests that even with the low noise, the M28s actual distortion lies below that noise floor. Therefore, to be sure I was measuring actual distortion, I examined how the amplifiers THD+N percentage varied with frequency at 9V, which is equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms, 20W into 4 ohms, and 40W into 2 ohms. The results are shown in  .8: the THD is superbly low at or below 1kHz, even into 2 ohms  , but rises slightly in the treble, presumably due to the circuits decreasing amount of gain-bandwidth margin reducing the amount of corrective negative feedback available. But even at 20kHz into 2 ohms, the THD+N is still just 0.04%.Fig.8 Bricasti M28, THD+N   vs frequency at 9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The distortion signature was predominantly third-harmonic in nature  , though  .10 reveals that, even at 40% power into 4 ohms, this lay at –90dB  . Even with the slight rise in THD in the top octave, intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level a few dB below visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope into 4 ohms was very low  . The difference component at 1kHz lay at just –112dB below the peak signal level  , and the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were at –97dB  .Fig.9 Bricasti M28, 1kHz waveform at 75W into 8 ohms, 0.0019% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Bricasti M28, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Bricasti M28, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Its measured performance reveals Bricastis M28 to be a worthy stablemate to the companys superb-measuring and equally superb-sounding M1 D/A processor.

       " '  Gryphon Essence    .   amplifier by operating it with class-AB output-stage bias at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time, the top panels temperature was 88.3°F   and that of the side-mounted heatsinks 90.4°F  . Repeating the preconditioning with class-A bias after letting the amplifier cool down resulted in a slightly higher heatsink temperature, 92.1°F  . The Essence monoblock easily has sufficient heatsink capacity for its output power.The Gryphons voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 30.7dB with both output-stage bias conditions, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  , the XLR input jack being wired with its pin 2 positive. The input impedance was close to 10k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. Though this is half the specified 20k ohms, it is still sufficiently high not to cause compatibility problems with tube preamplifiers.The Gryphons output impedance in class-A was higher than the specified 0.015 ohms, at 0.26 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz and 0.28 ohm at 20kHz.   The output impedance was slightly higher in class-AB, at 0.29 ohms at 1kHz. Nevertheless, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was small, at ±0.2dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was flat to 20kHz and down by 3dB at 170kHz, which correlates with the Essences superb reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . Commendably, there was no overshoot or ringing with the squarewave response. Into 2 ohms  , the response was –0.2dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 90kHz.Fig.1 Gryphon Essence, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Gryphon Essence, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Measured with the input shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was an excellent 86.5dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms, this ratio improving to 95.9dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband, and to 100.8dB when A-weighted. This is a quiet amplifier. Spuriae at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its harmonics were very low in level but varied with the output-stage bias. The spuriae at 60Hz and 180Hz were highest in level with class-A bias, at –104dB and –110dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  , and were even lower in level with class-AB bias  .Fig.3 Gryphon Essence, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with class-A bias   and class-AB    .The Essences manual specifies the amplifiers maximum power as 55W into 8 ohms, 110W into 4 ohms, and 220W into 2 ohms, all equivalent to 17.4dBW  . Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the Gryphon didnt quite meet its specified powers, clipping with a 1kHz signal at 53W into 8 ohms   with both class-A bias   and class-AB bias  . In both bias conditions, the THD+N was very low at powers of a few watts. Into 4 ohms, the Essence clipped at 101W  , but the THD+N was lower at low powers with class-A bias   than with class-AB bias  . The Essence didnt quite meet its specified power into 2 ohms, clipping at 182W  . However, it is relevant to note that I dont hold the AC wall voltage constant when I test an amplifiers clipping power.Fig.4 Gryphon Essence, class-A bias, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Gryphon Essence, class-AB bias, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Gryphon Essence, class-A bias, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Gryphon Essence, class-AB bias, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Gryphon Essence, class-A bias, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Fig.9 Gryphon Essence, class-AB bias, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.I measured how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 12.65V, which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms, 40W into 4 ohms, and 80W into 2 ohms, which are all approximately 4dB below the clipping powers into these loads. The THD+N was very low in the midrange into 8 and 4 ohms with both class-A bias   and class-AB bias  , but rose into 2 ohms  . There is the usual increase in THD+N in the top audio octaves, due to the circuits limited open-loop bandwidth.  Fig.10 Gryphon Essence, class-A bias, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.11 Gryphon Essence, class-AB bias, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .With class-A bias, the Gryphon Essences distortion was predominantly an equal mix of the subjectively benign second and third harmonics  , each lying at –73dB   ref. 20W into 8 ohms. Higher harmonics are all much lower in level. With class-AB bias, the second harmonic was the highest in level, at the same –73dB  , but there were now more higher-order harmonics present. When the Essence drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 20W into 8 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay just above –80dB   in both bias conditions with higher-order intermodulation products a little higher in level, at –70dB  .Fig.12 Gryphon Essence, class-A bias, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.0385% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.13 Gryphon Essence, class-A bias, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.14 Gryphon Essence, class-AB bias, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.15 Gryphon Essence, class-A bias, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms  .The Gryphon Essence performed very well on the test bench.

       " ' Fig.6 is a spectrum of the dm58s output at 200W into 8 ohms, taken with a very linear signal generator: the National Instruments NI4451 PCI card that Miller Audio Research uses as one of the platforms for its QC Suite measurement software. The second, third, and fourth harmonics are all between -106dB and -110dB! The summed total of the harmonics is around 0.0008%, but even then, this is not appreciably higher than the level of the residual harmonics present in the NI cards output  .    Fig.6 Halcro dm58, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC-10kHz, at 200W into 8 ohms  .  Given this very low THD, it seemed academic to examine the Halcros intermodulation behavior with the Audio Precision System One. Nevertheless, I include  .7 because it shows that, even at the high power level featured in this measurement—220W into 4 ohms, just below visible clipping on the scope screen—the only intermodulation products present are those in the output of the DAC used to drive the amplifier.    Fig.7 Halcro dm58, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-24kHz, 19+20kHz at 220W into 4 ohms  .  Finally,  .8 shows how the percentage of THD+noise present in the dm58s output varied with continuous output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The constant downward slope with increasing frequency reveals that the measured  ure is dominated by noise below the \"knee\" of the traces, not distortion. In addition, the slight sawteeth present in the traces, due to the Audio Precision System Ones automatic gain-ranging, reveal that the Halcros residual THD+N is at the lower limit of what is possible to measure with this setup. The actual clipping points   are 260W into 8 ohms   and 490W into 4 ohms  . Into 2 ohms, the amplifiers protection circuitry cut in at 210W, muting the output. Into 4 ohms, it cut in at 500W.    Fig.8 Halcro dm58, distortion   vs continuous output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.  Halcros dm58 offers astonishing measured performance for an amplifier, particularly when it comes to harmonic and intermodulation distortion. Most important, this does not appear to have been achieved by compromising other aspects of the amplifiers performance, as was the case in the \"THD Wars\" of the 1970s.           ',\n",
       " '  Soulution 710, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . I ran the 710 at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour, which maximally stresses a class-A/B amplifiers heatsinking. At the end of this preconditioning period the amplifiers top panel was only slightly warm, at 90°F  .The voltage gain into 8 ohms was 25.9dB from both the balanced and unbalanced inputs, and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 hot. The unbalanced input impedance was the specified 10k ohms at all frequencies. However, the balanced input impedance was 2860 ohms, which is both low in absolute terms and significantly lower than the specified 4.8k ohms. Tube preamplifiers with a high balanced source impedance are best avoided, though it is fair to say that such preamps are rare.The output impedance, including the series resistance of 6 of speaker cable, was very low, at 0.06 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.075 ohm at 20kHz. The variation in the amplifiers frequency response, due to the interaction between this impedance and how that of the speaker varies with frequency, is therefore also very low, at ±0.07dB  . Into 8 ohms  , the Soulution 710 offered a very wide small-signal bandwidth—note the superb channel matching in this graph—which correlated with the very short risetimes of the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  , though there was the slightest hint of overshoot. The ultrasonic output rolled off a little faster into lower impedances, but even into 2 ohms, the output was still flat within the audioband and down 3dB at 160kHz  . The 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms was about as good as it gets  .Fig.1 Soulution 710, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Soulution 710, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Soulution 710, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was superb, at >110dB below 1kHz and still 84dB in both directions at 20kHz. The Soulution is also a very quiet amplifier, its unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio measuring 83dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the S/N ratio to 94dB, and switching in an A-weighting filter further increased it, to 96.8dB. The Soulution 710 joins that select group of amplifiers that has sufficient dynamic range to match the best high-resolution recordings.Despite the very low noise level, any distortion present in the 710s output remains below that noise almost to the point where the amplifier clips. Figs. 4 and 5 plot the percentage of THD+noise against output power at 1kHz into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively; the constant downward slope of the traces in these graphs indicates that the THD+N percentage is dominated by noise. If clipping is defined as when the percentage of THD+N reaches 1%, the Soulution 710 with both channels driven clips at 130Wpc into 8 ohms   and 218Wpc into 4 ohms  . With just one channel driven, the clipping power was 135W into 8 ohms  , 260W into 4 ohms  , and 490W into 2 ohms  . The amplifier meets or exceeds its specified 130W into 8 ohms and 260W into 4 ohms  , but only with one channel driven. This is because I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests; it was 121.5V AC with the amplifier quiescent, dropping to 120.1V AC with the amplifier clipping both channels into 4 ohms or one channel into 2 ohms.Fig.4 Soulution 710, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Soulution 710, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Soulution specifies the THD at 50W into 8 ohms, which is equivalent to 20V, so that is the level at which I plotted the THD+N percentage. The results are shown in  .6; the THD+N in the midrange and bass into both 8 and 4 ohms is an astonishingly low 0.0006%. This does rise at higher frequencies and into 2 ohms, but not to any level that would cause concern.Fig.6 Soulution 710, THD+N  vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .With a 1kHz signal, I had to raise the output level close to clipping in order to see the distortion spuriae  . These are predominantly third-harmonic in nature, but even after averaging 64 waveform captures, the trace is still overlaid with noise.   The spectrum of the signal is shown in  .8. The third harmonic is the highest in level, at –114dB  , with the second harmonic in the left channel and the fifth in the right lying at –120dB  , along with a power-supply component at 120Hz. The Soulution 710 performed equally well on the high-frequency intermodulation test. With an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 85W into 8 ohms  , the 1kHz difference components lay at –120dB!Fig.7 Soulution 710, 1kHz waveform at 101W into 8 ohms  , 0.00056% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Soulution 710, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 101W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Soulution 710, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 85W peak into 8 ohms  .The following sentence appeared in a review of the Soulution 710 published in October 2005 in the German magazine Stereo: \"Lab chief technician Rolf Hähle has hung the test certificate for the Soulution 710 in a golden frame over his measuring desk.\" I wouldnt go quite that far, but the Soulution 710 is definitely one of the best-measuring amplifiers I have encountered. Color me impressed.           ',\n",
       " '  Bel Canto e1X    . As the Bel Canto is a class-D design, it wasnt necessary to precondition the amplifier by using it to drive a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms. Nevertheless, before doing any testing I ran it for an hour at a moderate power level, to ensure that it was fully warmed up. Because class-D amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slew-rate limiting, all   with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz. Without the filter, there was 398mV of ultrasonic noise present at the loudspeaker terminals.The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was the specified 27dB from both the balanced and single-ended inputs. Internal switches should increase the gain by 6dB; I measured 5.1dB.   The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   from both sets of inputs. The single-ended input impedance measured the specified 10k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping very slightly to 9.2k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was exactly twice these values, again as specified.The Bel Cantos output impedance, including the series impedance of 6 of loudspeaker cable, was a very low 0.06 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing very slightly to 0.07 ohm at 20kHz. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore minuscule, at ±0.1dB  . The response into resistive loads was flat to 10kHz into 8 ohms, then down by 0.6dB at 20kHz and 3dB at 38kHz  . The restricted ultrasonic response is responsible for slightly lengthened risetimes with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . There is also a faint hint of overshoot with the Bel Cantos squarewave response, this presumably due to the class-D output stages integral low-pass filter.Fig.1 Bel Canto e1x, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Bel Canto e1x, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was superb at \\x1a105dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 82dB at 20kHz. With the Audio Precision ultrasonic filter, the gain set to 27dB, and the analog inputs shorted to ground, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured 73.7dB in the left channel and 71.4dB in the right. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 90.8dB, left, and 85.5dB, right, and an A-weighting filter increased it further, to an excellent 100dB in both channels. Spectral analysis of the Bel Cantos low-frequency noise floor   revealed spuriae related to the AC power-line frequency to be very low in level.Fig.3 Bel Canto e1x, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The e1X is specified as delivering a maximum output power, at 1% THD+noise, of 250Wpc into 8 ohms, and 500Wpc into 4 ohms,3 both equivalent to 24dBW  . I found that the Bel Canto amplifier easily exceeded its specified power, clipping at 340Wpc into 8 ohms   and at 530Wpc into 4 ohms  , both powers at 1% THD+noise.Fig.4 Bel Canto e1x, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Bel Canto e1x, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Distortion levels in the bass and midrange were low   and didnt increase by much into 2 ohms  . The THD was higher in the treble, especially into lower impedances  . The shape of the THD+N spuriae waveform at a moderate power into 8 ohms   suggests that the distortion signature is primarily third harmonic in nature, though spectral analysis reveals that the second harmonic is also present at a slightly lower level  . Higher-order harmonics all lie below –110dB  . Into lower impedances  , the second harmonic rises to the same level as the third, but at –90dB  , neither will have any effect on the amplifiers sound. Despite the rise in THD in the top audio octaves, intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones was very low, even at high powers into 4 ohms  .Fig.6 Bel Canto e1x, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Bel Canto e1x, 1kHz waveform at 30W into 8 ohms, 0.0035% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Bel Canto e1x, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Bel Canto e1x, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Bel Cantos e1X performed well on the test bench. Footnote 1: Our dBW  ures follow the convention established by Martin Colloms and the late Peter W. Mitchell in the 1980s: they are referred to 2.83V  . Thus an amplifier that behaves as a perfect voltage source   offers the same dBW rating into all loads, an easier paradigm to grasp than having to remember to add 3dB every time the load impedance halves.

       " ' ,   Bel Canto e.One S300iu by running both channels at one-third the maximum power into 8 ohms for one hour. Thermally, this maximally stresses an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. But with its class-D output stage, the Bel Canto hardly got warm.  S300iu using Audio Precisions top-model SYS2722 system   for most of the tests, with the obsolete AP System One bringing up the rear. The S300ius maximum gain into 8 ohms was 46.5dB, which is a little higher than usual for an integrated amplifier. Measured at the amplifiers preamp output jacks, the maximum voltage gain was basically to specification at 19.6dB, while the unity-gain setting of the volume control was \"80\" out of a possible \"100.\" The volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps. The S300ius input impedance was 11.5k ohms across the audioband, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity; ie, it was non-inverting. The preamplifier section also preserved absolute polarity, and its output impedance was a consistent 100 ohms across the band, significantly but usefully lower than the specified 500 ohms.The amplifiers output impedance, measured at the speaker jacks, was 0.2 ohm at low and middle frequencies, dropping to 0.04 ohm at 20kHz. The Bel Cantos frequency response was flat within the audioband, but its top-octave behavior depended on the load impedance  , presumably due to the interaction between the load and the amplifiers low-pass output filter.   Peculiarly, the response into our standard simulated loudspeaker   was lower than into an 8 ohm resistive load  , despite this load exceeding 8 ohms at some frequencies. Perhaps it is relevant that the other channel was driving a 2 ohm resistor when I took this measurement, which means that there might be some cross-modulation when the two channels are handling very different signals, though I admit this is an unlikely event.Fig.1 Bel Canto S300iu, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  For all the remaining amplifier tests, I used an Audio Precision AUX-0025 Switching Amplifier Measurement Filter between the test load and the test systems. This is because, even with its own low-pass filter, a switching amplifier still puts out a high level of ultrasonic noise that, without further filtering, will drive the input of the test system into slew-rate limiting. For example, without passing an audio signal, the Bel Canto S300iu put out 1.2V RMS of ultrasonic noise with a center frequency of approximately 350kHz. This noise compromises the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   to just 8dB! Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved the S/N ratio to a more respectable 62.7dB.   Channel separation   was excellent, at better than 100dB below 800Hz. The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was respectable  , though with a single critically damped cycle of ringing evident on the leading edges.  Fig.2 Bel Canto S300iu, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms. Measured with Audio Precision passive LP filter.Fig.3 plots the percentage of THD+noise in the amplifiers output against output power into 8 and 4 ohms.   Surprisingly, the amplifier didnt meet its specified maximum output power into either load. Defining clipping as when the THD+N reached 1%, the S300iu clipped at 105W into 8 ohms and 202W into 4 ohms  . It did meet its rated power, 150W into 8 ohms  , at 11% THD.Fig.3 Bel Canto S300iu, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 4, 8 ohms. Measured with AP passive LPF.Fig.4 shows how the percentage of THD+N in the Bel Cantos output varies with both frequency and load impedance.   It is hard to discern a pattern in this graph. The blue and red traces show the behavior of the left and right channels, respectively, into 8 ohms. Very low at low frequencies, the distortion rises by an order of magnitude in the top two audio octaves. Into 4 ohms  , the THD+N at low frequencies and in the top two octaves is a little lower than into 8 ohms, but is higher between 500Hz and 5kHz. Unusually, into 2 ohms  , the THD+N is even lower at low frequencies than it is into higher impedances.Fig.4 Bel Canto S300iu, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  . Measured with AP passive LPF.To some extent, of course, it is the spectrum of the distortion that matters, not its absolute level. At moderate power into 8 ohms, the Bel Canto produced predominantly third-harmonic distortion  , which will be subjectively benign. Yes, higher-order spuriae can be seen in the spectrum  , but these are all below –90dB. However, at the same output voltage into 4 ohms, the picture changes completely  . While the measured THD percentage has slightly more than doubled, the third harmonic has almost disappeared and sharp spikes bracket the waveforms zero-crossing points, these equivalent to high-order harmonics  , which will be subjectively more offensive. Only at low frequencies did the Bel Canto S300iu behave like a traditional amplifier, even at high powers into 4 ohms  .Fig.5 Bel Canto S300iu, 1kHz waveform at 12.5W into 8 ohms  , 0.019% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  . Measured with AP passive LPF.Fig.6 Bel Canto S300iu, 1kHz waveform at 24.2W into 4 ohms  , 0.0265% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .

Measured with AP passive LPF.Fig.9 Bel Canto S300iu, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 140W into 4 ohms  . Measured with AP passive LPF.The decrease in linearity in the top octaves gives rise to a disappointing result with the high-power, high-frequency intermodulation test. While the second-order component at 1kHz is respectably low, there are many higher-order components visible in the top octaves  .Fig.10 Bel Canto S300iu, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms  . Measured with AP passive LPF.Turning to the S300ius USB input, I tested this using my Apple G4 PowerBook as source and analyzing the Bel Cantos behavior at its preamplifier output jacks. The USB input is compatible with sample rates up to 48kHz, but is limited to 16-bit data. This will not be a practical limitation given the amplifiers target market, I feel. The frequency response via the USB input was flat, so I havent shown it. But examining the internal DACs resolution using my traditional technique of sweeping a 1/3-octave bandpass filter from 20kHz to 20Hz while it decoded 16-bit data representing a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, it was apparent that the DAC didnt reach 16-bit performance. Not only did the peak fail to reach the –90dB line  , significant amounts of distortion harmonics were present  . The DACs linearity plot   shows increasing amounts of negative error below –80dBFS; in effect, the DAC is taking energy from the fundamental below this level and pumping it into distortion harmonics. Correlating with this, the waveform of an undithered 1kHz tone at –90.31dBFS, which should show three clearly defined DC levels, is obscured by noise  .Fig.11 Bel Canto S300iu, USB input ,1/3-octave spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16-bit data  .Fig.12 Bel Canto S300iu, USB input, left-channel departure from linearity, 16-bit data  .Fig.13 Bel Canto S300iu, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Finally, while data streamed to a DAC via a USB connection in theory should be free from word-clock–related jitter, the S300ius USB input didnt do well when I drove it with the Miller diagnostic tone. Not only were relatively high levels of data-related sideband energy present in the amplifiers analog output, but very strong sidebands could be detected at ±1kHz, ±2kHz, and ±3kHz  . I dont know what these might be due to, but the Miller Jitter Analyzer calculated the jitter level as a very high 4 nanoseconds peak–peak. As with other amplifiers I have measured in recent years that feature a USB input for digital audio data, the Bel Cantos is best regarded as a convenience feature. It is certainly not suitable for critical listening, in my opinion. For that, you need to use something like Bel Cantos e.One DAC3.Fig.14 Bel Canto S300iu, USB input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal  , 16-bit data sourced from Apple TiBook and measured at preamplifier output. Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz  .It is difficult to sum up the e.One S300ius measured behavior as an amplifier. To some extent, the amplifier will be a sonic chameleon. At low and midrange frequencies, it measured very well into 8 ohms. But at higher frequencies and especially into lower impedances, it misbehaved in a way I would have expected to be audible with some kinds of music. I suspect that it is this higher-frequency misbehavior that WP picked up on when he talked about the amplifier as occasionally having a \"bleached\" midrange.           ',\n",
       " '  Audionet Max monoblocks      .   of a power amplifier, I precondition it by running it at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes with a 1kHz tone: This power level results in the highest thermal stress on the output devices of an amplifier having a class-B or -AB output stage. The Max turned itself off after 42 minutes, its front panel displaying the message \"SEVERE ERROR OVERHEATING.\" The Audionets top panel at that point was fairly hot, at 117.3°F  .What I found interesting about the amplifiers behavior was that its THD+noise, which was extraordinarily low with the amplifier cold, at 0.0008%, stayed close to that level for almost the entire 42 minutes, but then rose to around 0.03%  . If I then reduced the level of the input signal so that the output power was lower than one-third power, the THD+N remained around 0.03%. If I didnt reduce the input level, the amplifier turned itself off several seconds after the increase in THD. I let the amplifier cool down for a couple of hours, then resumed testing. The Maxs protection circuits kicked in several times during the measuring when I was operating it at high powers, particularly at high frequencies, giving me the message \"SEVERE ERROR HIGH FREQUENCY.\" Each time, I let the amplifier cool down before continuing the testing.Fig.1 Audionet Max, THD+N  .The voltage gain into 8 ohms for the balanced input was a low 23.4dB. Unusually, the gain via the unbalanced inputs was 6dB higher. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity, the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedances were close to the specified values, at 35k ohms unbalanced and 3k ohms balanced. The latter is very low; if this amplifier is used with tubed preamps, which typically have a high output impedance at low frequencies, the bass will sound rolled off.The output impedance was very low, at 0.045 ohm   at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.07 ohm at 20kHz. The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by just ±0.05dB  . The Max offered a wide small-signal bandwidth, with the response into 8 ohms   down by just over 1dB at 200kHz. The Audionets reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   thus featured very short risetimes, and no overshoot or ringing was visible.Fig.2 Audionet Max, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.3 Audionet Max, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Not only does the Audionet Max have very low distortion—it is also very quiet. Its unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground, was a superb 85.4dB, which increased to 98.5dB when the measurement was A-weighted. Fig.4 reveals that the only spuriae present in the output were at the 60Hz supply frequency and its odd-order harmonics, but these are all at very low levels.Fig.4 Audionet Max, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Audionet Max exceeded its specified output power of 400W into 8 ohms  , clipping at 450W into that load  . Note that in this graph, the actual distortion lies beneath the noise at powers below 30W, indicated by the upward slope of the trace as the power decreases. Fig.6 reveals that the amplifier also exceeded its specified power of 700W into 4 ohms  , clipping at 750W  . The Max clipped at the specified 1100W into 2 ohms  , though the AC wall voltage had dropped from 123V to 118.5V at the clip point.Fig.5 Audionet Max, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Audionet Max, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 plots the THD+noise percentage against frequency at a level, 20V, that is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms, and where I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise. Even so, the THD+N percentage remains very low, with only slight rises in the top octave and into the lower impedance. I havent shown the THD+N plotted against frequency into 2 ohms at this level  , as despite repeated attempts, the amplifiers protection circuit cut in and displayed the \"SEVERE ERROR HIGH FREQUENCY\" message. At low frequencies and high powers into low impedances, the highest-level distortion harmonic was the third  , though with a 1kHz tone at the same output voltage into 8 ohms, the second harmonic was the highest in level  . Intermodulation distortion was also extremely low  , even at a level close to visual waveform clipping on an oscilloscope, where the 1kHz difference product rose from –120dB   to –96dB  .Fig.7 Audionet Max, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Audionet Max, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Audionet Max, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Audionet Max, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Audionet Max, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 300W peak into 8 ohms  .As I am coming to expect from expensive German amplifiers, Audionets Max performed very well on the test bench, offering high powers with very low levels of distortion and noise. It doesnt quite have enough heatsink capacity for its power-output capability, but I suspect that that shortcoming will not be a problem in normal use, especially given its very effective protection circuitry.   My only reservation concerned its very low balanced input impedance, but this wont be an issue with modern solid-state preamps and digital source components.           ',\n",
       " '  Bryston 7B SST2s measured behavior using mainly Stereophiles loaner sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. s on an amplifier, I run it for 60 minutes at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms, which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. The Brystons chassis and heatsinks were way too hot to touch after 30 minutes of running at this power level, though after the full hour I could still keep my hand on the front panel, implying a temperature of about 131°F  . Clearly, the 7B SST2 has enough heatsink capacity for sustained high-power use.The Brystons voltage gain into 8 ohms was 29dB when the amplifier was set to \"1V\" sensitivity, 22.9dB when set to \"2V,\" these  ures the same for both balanced and unbalanced drive. Both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot. The balanced input impedance was 10k ohms across the audioband; the unbalanced stayed close to a moderately low 7.5k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping a little, to 7.2k ohms, at 20kHz. This would not have been a problem for the unbalanced outputs of MFs darTZeel preamplifier, which is what he used for the auditioning, but the Brystons balanced input is incompatible with the darTZeels balanced output, which has an atypically high source impedance that varies with frequency.The Brystons output impedance was low for a balanced design, at 0.11 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising slightly to 0.17 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between its source impedance and that of the speaker will be small. With our simulated loudspeaker, the variations in response remained within ±0.1dB limits  . The amplifiers response into 8 ohms didnt reach –3dB until almost 200kHz  , which correlates with the well-defined 10kHz squarewave response  . The 7B SST2s output does start to fall slightly above 10kHz into lower impedances; into 2 ohms  , the output at 20kHz is down 0.4dB, though this will have no subjective consequences.Fig.1 Bryston 7B SST2, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Bryston 7B SST2, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The 7B SST2 is a quiet amplifier. Its unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured 75.6dB, this improving to 92dB with the measurement bandwidth restricted to the audioband, and to 95.7dB when A-weighted. These  ures were in the low-gain setting; the high-gain performance was approximately 3dB worse. Fig.3 plots the percentage of THD+noise in the Brystons output against power. The downward slope of the plots below 10W implies that what distortion is present is buried beneath the noise. Only into 2 ohms does the amplifiers THD start to rise above the noise at relatively low powers, but even then it remains less than 0.01% below actual waveform clipping. The Brystons maximum power delivery is specified at 600W into 8 ohms  ; the traces in  .3 indicate that at clipping  , the amplifier puts out 632W into 8 ohms  , 930W into 4 ohms  , but 690W into 2 ohms  .Fig.3 Bryston 7B SST2, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.I examined how the Brystons THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a level of 14V, or 24.5W into 8 ohms, where the distortion was starting to emerge from the background noise  . The THD starts to rise above 1kHz, more so into 4 ohms   than into 8 ohms  , due to the falling amount of open-loop gain margin reducing the effectiveness of the negative-feedback mojo. The amplifier is clearly less comfortable into 2 ohms  ; even so, the absolute distortion levels remain very low at all frequencies.Fig.4 Bryston 7B SST2, THD+N   vs frequency at 14V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .More important,  .5 reveals that the distortion spectrum consists almost entirely of subjectively innocuous low-order components, though a comparison of the spectra at high power into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms   indicates that the third harmonic rises as the output current increases. Note, however, the very low level of AC supply spuriae in these graphs. The 7B SST2s power supply is clearly more than adequate for the high powers this amplifier is designed to deliver. Finally, when tested at close to clipping into 4 ohms with the demanding combination of 19 and 20kHz tones, the Brystons output spectrum   was more like that of a preamplifier, with all intermodulation products at or below –100dB  .Fig.5 Bryston 7B SST2, 1kHz waveform at 196W into 4 ohms  , 0.0019% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Bryston 7B SST2, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 196W into 8 ohms  .Fig.7 Bryston 7B SST2, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 382W into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Bryston 7B SST2, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 400W peak into 4 ohms  .As is usual with Bryston amplifiers, the 7B SST2 offers textbook measured performance and usefully high power.

       " '  Bricasti Design M15    .  , I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time, the Bricastis top panel was warm, at 101°F  , and its heatsinks were hotter, at 103.1°F  . The M15 has sufficient heatsinking for its power rating.The voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 26.9dB for both balanced and unbalanced signals, and both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The unbalanced input impedance was 88k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, decreasing at 20kHz to 34k ohms. The balanced input impedance was 170k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, decreasing to 99k ohms at 20kHz. Though these impedances are somewhat lower than the specified 100k ohms unbalanced and 200k ohms balanced, they are still usefully high.The output impedance, including a 6, spaced-pair speaker cable, was a very low 0.08 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.1 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the modulation of the M15s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was less than ±0.1dB  . The Bricastis frequency response is down by 3dB at 180kHz; as a result, a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with very short risetimes  , and there was no overshoot or ringing with a resistive load.Fig.1 Bricasti M15, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Bricasti M15, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the inputs shorted to ground, was a very high 81.2dB in the left channel but slightly lower in the right, at 77dB.   These ratios improved to a respective 84 and 78dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 86 and 83.4dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor   indicated that the AC supply–related harmonics were at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, suggesting that these are due to magnetic interference from the massive power transformer. They lay at or below –98dB  , however.Fig.3 Bricasti M15, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Bricasti specifies the M15 as outputting 125Wpc into 8 ohms  , 250Wpc into 4 ohms  , and 500Wpc into 2 ohms  . The amplifier comfortably exceeded its specified power even with both channels driven. With clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1%, I measured clipping powers of 290Wpc into 8 ohms   and 550Wpc into 4 ohms  . However, I had some difficulty measuring the maximum output power, as the M15 went into protection several times, the red LED on its front panel flashing. And when I tried to measure the clipping power into 2 ohms, the amplifier turned off at 362W  . I doubt that this sensitivity will be a problem in real-world systems, but I was surprised by this behavior.Fig.4 Bricasti M15, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Bricasti M15, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.To be certain that I was measuring actual distortion, I examined how the M15s percentage of THD+N varied with frequency at a fairly high level, 20V  . Even so, the THD+N was extremely low in the bass and midrange, and while there was the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in open-loop voltage gain as the frequency increases, this was still not to a significant amount  .Fig.6 Bricasti M15, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The THD+N waveform at this level   indicates that the distortion is predominantly third-harmonic in nature, though at high powers into 4 ohms the second harmonic became the highest in level in both channels  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, the Bricasti produced relatively low levels of intermodulation distortion, even at high powers into low impedances  , with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –100dB  , and the higher-order products at or below –84dB  .Fig.7 Bricasti M15, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0012% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Bricasti M15, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Bricasti M15, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Bricasti M15, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .Its measured performance indicates that Bricasti Designs M15 amplifier is conservatively engineered, with low noise and distortion, though it is clearly less happy driving 2 ohms than it is higher impedances.

       " 'Although the ELAC Alchemy DPA-2 is a stereo amplifier, Jason Victor Serinus auditioned it as a pair of monoblocks.   I therefore performed a complete set of measurements with a DPA-2 in mono mode then repeated some of the tests in stereo mode. As the DPA-2 has an output stage operating in class-D, I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter between the test load and my   system. This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slew-rate limiting. I used it for all the tests other than frequency response.Though the Alchemy DPA-2 has both balanced and single-ended inputs, I performed most of the measurements using the balanced inputs, which the manual says are preferred. With the amplifier in stereo mode, I measured a low voltage gain of 18.7dB into 8 ohms with both types of inputs and the gain set to Normal. High gain mode increased the gain by a useful 5.9dB. In mono mode, the DPA-2s gain into 8 ohms was 24.6dB and 30.4dB on the Normal and High gain settings. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both inputs in both stereo and mono modes. The XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance is specified as 12k ohms single-ended and 19k ohms, balanced. I measured 11.9k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz for the single-ended inputs, dropping inconsequentially to 10.7k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 18k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz, ie, 9k ohms per phase.The output impedance in stereo mode is specified as 0.03 ohms at 1kHz. I measured a very low 0.078 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 0.095 ohms at 20kHz.   The output impedance was a little higher in mono mode, as there are now two output stages in series. I measured 0.105 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 0.14 ohms at 20kHz. Even so, the modulation of the ELACs frequency response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker was minuscule, at ±0.05dB  . The small-signal bandwidth was restricted by the low-pass filter between the amplifiers class-D stage and its output terminals. Into 8 ohms  , the ultrasonic rolloff reached –3dB at 50kHz, a little more into lower impedances. The rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  . There is a critically damped overshoot on the tops and bottoms of the waveform, but there is no ringing.Fig.1 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Without the auxiliary low-pass filter, 191mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the DPA-2s output terminals. With the AP filter and the DPA-2 set to stereo mode and normal gain, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the single-ended inputs shorted to ground, was an excellent 82dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. It improved to 95.4dB when I restricted the measurement to the audioband and to 98.1dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. In high-gain stereo mode, these ratios were all around 3dB lower; they were down another 3dB or so in mono mode. Nevertheless, this is a quiet amplifier. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor in mono mode   revealed some AC-supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, though these all lie below –100dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. The red trace in  .3 is the spectrum with the amplifier set to normal gain. High gain   increased the random noise components by around 3dB.Fig.3 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with normal gain   and +6dB gain    .The Alchemy DPA-2s maximum power is specified at 325Wpc into 4 ohms in stereo mode  . With clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1%, the ELACs clipping power in this mode with one channel driven was 339W into 4 ohms  . In stereo mode, the amplifier clipped at 202W into 8 ohms  . As expected, considerably more power was available in mono mode. At 1% THD+N, the DPA-1 delivered 590W into 8 ohms   and 550W into 4 ohms  . Though the 8 ohm power is a little lower—0.3dB—than the specified power of 625W  , the AC power line had dropped to 118.5V with the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms.Fig.4 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, stereo mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.5 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Figs.4–6 show that the Alchemy DPA-2 had very low distortion at powers below a few tens of watts. I examined how the ELACs THD+N varied with frequency at 20V  .3 The distortion into 8 ohms was close to 0.01%  , though it rose at high frequencies and into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms  .Fig.7 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The ELAC amplifiers distortion signature in mono mode into 8 ohms was primarily third harmonic in nature  . Though some second, fifth, and seventh harmonics are present  , these are all at or below –90dB  . At the same output voltage into 4 ohms, which is equivalent to 200W, the second and higher odd-order harmonics rose in level  , though the third harmonic dropped a little. With an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones and the signal peaking at 200W into 4 ohms  , the decrease in the circuits linearity at very high frequencies resulted in some higher-order products, the highest in level of which, at 21kHz and 18kHz, each lay at –70dB  . The difference product at 1kHz, even at this very high power, lay at –96dB  .Fig.8 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, 1kHz waveform at 80W into 8 ohms, 0.0187% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 ELAC Alchemy DPA-2, mono mode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .The ELAC Alchemy DPA-2 amplifier is a powerhouse, especially in mono mode. Footnote 1: There was one oddity I noted when   DPA-2. I have a portable FM radio in the test lab that I keep tuned to WNYC, New York Citys NPR station. When I powered up the DPA-2 and fed it an audio signal, I could hear a tone at the frequency of the test signal, overlaid with fizzy noise, reproduced by the radios speaker. This was very noticeable when I swept the test signal down from 20kHz to 20Hz to generate the traces in  .8. I have only encountered this RF interference with one other modern class-D amplifier, the Spec RPA-W7EX that Ken Micallef reviewed in March 2016.          ',\n",
       " '  After checking for continuity and the optimal grounding between the device under test and the Audio Precision System One test gear, my usual routine for an amplifier review is to run the amp for 60 minutes at 1/3 power into 8 ohms. This preconditioning both thermally stresses the amplifier and makes sure its operating conditions have stabilized.  With the Bryston 14B-SST, however, not only was its chassis too hot to touch after just 20 minutes of driving 200Wpc into 8 ohms, it turned itself off after 25 minutes. While this IHF-recommended test is very much the worst case for a design with a class-B output stage and it is unlikely the 14B-SST will get this hot under normal use with music, it does suggest that the amplifiers heatsinking is underspecified for continuous use at high levels.    Once the amplifier had cooled down and turned itself back on, I went on with my testing. The input impedance at 1kHz was to spec at 14.8k ohms balanced and 46.4k ohms unbalanced, and the amplifier didnt invert polarity from either input.   The voltage gain into 8 ohms was 28.9dB unbalanced and balanced, this dropping by 6dB with the balanced attenuator engaged. The output impedance measured 0.12 ohm across most of the band  , rising slightly to 0.21 ohm at 20kHz.  As a result of this low source impedance, there was very little interaction between it and the speaker impedance: just +0.2dB, -0.1dB, according to  .1. This graph also reveals that the 14B-SSTs ultrasonic bandwidth decreases with decreasing load impedance. The response is 3dB down at 148kHz into 8 ohms, at 100kHz into 4 ohms, and at 55kHz into 2 ohms. The response is down 1.4dB at 20kHz in the latter case, which might be just audible. These curves were taken using the unbalanced input; via the balanced input, the ultrasonic output was slightly more curtailed, at -3dB at 105kHz into 8 ohms, though this will not be subjectively significant. As a result of the high -3dB frequency, the 14B-SSTs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was essentially perfect  .    Fig.1 Bryston 14B-SST, unbalanced frequency response at  : 2.83V into dummy loudspeaker load, 1W into 8 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, 4W into 2 ohms  .    Fig.2 Bryston 14B-SST, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.  Channel separation was superb, at better than 110dB in both directions below 3kHz, while the Bryston was also very quiet. The A-weighted signal/noise ratio ref. 1W into 8 ohms was 96.5dB. The unweighted audioband ratio was only slightly less good, at 93.5dB, though this did worsen to 78dB with a wide measurement bandwidth. These  ures were all for the left channel; the right channel was somewhat worse due to the presence of some 60Hz, 180Hz, and 300Hz hum components. Nevertheless, these were still well low enough in level to be inaudible.  This increased noise level in the right channel can be seen in  .3, which plots the amplifiers small-signal distortion and noise against frequency. Other than at high frequencies, where there is a very slight increase in THD into the lower impedances, in this graph youre really looking only at noise.      Fig.3 Bryston 14B-SST, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms, simulated loudspeaker load  .  Increasing the power level and averaging 32 separate measurements to reduce the effect of noise reveals that what distortion is present—just 0.0038%—is almost pure third harmonic  . There did appear to be some high harmonics   at high power and low frequencies, but these are at vanishingly low levels. The level of intermodulation products present with the demanding mixture of 19kHz and 20kHz tones was also very low  , despite the very high power at which this spectrum was taken: 331W into 4 ohms, which was close to visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen.

The clip point into 4 ohms was just over a kilowatt  , but the amplifier was running out of grunt into 2 ohms, with 720W available at clipping  .

       " 'I began to perform a full suite of measurements on the PS Audio BHK Signature 300  ,    . First, however,   amplifier by running it at one-third the specified power, 100W, into 8 ohms for 60 minutes. At the end of that time, its top panel was warm and its heatsinks were hot, at 122.1°F  . The percentage of THD+noise at this power level was 0.0145% with the amplifier cold, 0.0164% with it fully warmed up.The BHK 300s voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was a little higher than usual, at 30.5dB with both balanced and unbalanced input signals. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , and the single-ended input impedance was 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, decreasing slightly and inconsequentially to 39k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was exactly twice these values, as expected. The output impedance   was on the high side for a solid-state amplifier, at 0.16 ohm at all audio frequencies.After that point, having been powered up for two hours, the BHK 300 became unstable. Both with signal present and with the input shorted to ground, there was a tone at 270kHz present at the output at a level of 3V. The front-panel light remained illuminated.   I put the amplifier into standby with its front-panel button, then turned it off with the rear-panel switch. When I turned it on again and let it go through its turn-on routine, it worked fine for about a minute, operating with a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms with very low distortion, after which the ultrasonic noise reappeared. I turned the amplifier off again, after which it wouldnt turn on at all.I redid all of the testing with serial no. 5G0063. This sample performed without any problems and matched no. 5G0062 very closely, at least with the tests Id performed up to the point where I had the problem.The gray trace in  .1 shows the BHK 300s small-signal frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker. The variations in response were just ±0.15dB, and into resistive loads the amplifier had a wide bandwidth, with –3dB frequencies of 195kHz into 8 ohms  , 175kHz into 4 ohms  , and 100kHz into 2 ohms  . With this wide bandwidth, it came as no surprise that the BHK 300s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured very short risetimes, though the slightest hint of overshoot is visible.Fig.1 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   was good, measuring 82.2dB.   This ratio improved to 86.7dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband, and 90.2dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor while the BHK 300 drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms revealed a regular series of AC-related spuriae  , though these were all very low in level.Fig.3 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The PS Audio comfortably exceeded its specified power outputs of 300W into 8 ohms and 600W into 4 ohms  , clipping at 370W into 8 ohms   and 620W into 4 ohms  . The BHK 300 clipped at 950W into 2 ohms, but was less comfortable at lower powers into this low an impedance. This can be seen in  .6, which plots the percentage of THD+noise into 8, 4, and 2 ohms at a level, 8.975V  , at which I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise. The THD was very low at low and middle frequencies into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , but rose into 2 ohms   and in the top two audio octaves.Fig.4 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.975V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The distortion signature was predominantly the relatively benign third harmonic in nature  , which was low in level even at high powers, lying at –80dB   into 8 ohms  . Reducing the load to 4 ohms at this output level   brought up the fifth and seventh harmonics a little  , but the third harmonic didnt increase. Despite the decreasing linearity at high frequencies seen in  .6, the BHK Signature 300 did very well when asked to handle an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level a few dB below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen. Even into 4 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay at –107dB  , and the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were still almost 80dB down from the peak signal level.Fig.7 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, 1kHz waveform at 60W into 4 ohms, 0.025% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 PS Audio BHK Signature 300, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Amplifiers do tend to break when I set them up on the test bench—its the audio equivalent of taking a car out on the skid pad to find out at what lateral g-force it rolls over—so I give PS Audios BHK Signature 300 the benefit of the doubt. Its measured performance indicates that it is a well-designed, well-engineered powerhouse of an amplifier, though it will perform at its best with speakers having an impedance of 4 ohms and above.           ',\n",
       " ' , I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . Before doing the testing, I ran the Musical Fidelity AMS100 at one-third its rated power for 60 minutes, which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-A/B output stage. However, an amplifier with a class-A output stage runs cooler when under load. At the end of that period, the chassis was warm, with a temperature of 104°F  , though the heatsinks were hotter, at 116°F  . Without any signal fed to the amplifier, the heatsink temperature slowly rose to 120°F  . The AMS100 is not an amplifier you can hide in a closet—even if you have a closet big enough.The voltage gain was the same for both balanced and unbalanced inputs, at 29.9dB, which is 3dB higher than the US norm. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLRs being wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance was close to specification at low and middle frequencies, at 48k ohms unbalanced and balanced for each leg, but dropped at 20kHz to 39k ohms balanced and 17k ohms unbalanced.The AMS100s output impedance   was low across most of the audioband, at 0.08 ohm. However, this rose to 0.22 ohm at 20kHz, which restricts the amplifiers bandwidth into lower impedances. While the small-signal frequency response is down by just 0.17dB at 20kHz and by 3dB at 170kHz  , it is –0.5dB at 20kHz into 4 ohms   and –0.9dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . However, the variation of the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was minimal, at ±0.1dB  . The wide bandwidth into 8 ohms gives rise to a well-formed 10kHz squarewave, with neither overshoot nor ringing evident  . The 1kHz squarewave   was equally well-formed.Fig.1 Musical Fidelity AMS100, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Musical Fidelity AMS100, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Musical Fidelity AMS100, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was excellent at >100dB below 800Hz in both directions, and was still 80dB at 20kHz. The unweighted wideband signal/noise ratio was not as good as I was expecting from a class-A design, at 76.8dB left and 75.3dB right, both  ures ref. 1W into 8 ohms. A-weighting improved the ratios to a respectable 89.2 and 90.75dB, respectively. Fig.4 reveals that the AMS100s low-frequency noise floor has some supply-related spuriae: the tones at 120 and 240Hz stem from the full-wave supply and are a little higher in the right channel than the left; those at 60 and 180Hz and higher may well be due to magnetic leakage from the massive power transformers into the chokes used to smooth the DC voltage rails. Nevertheless, all these spuriae lie at better than –120dB ref. maximum power, and so should be inaudible.Fig.4 Musical Fidelity AMS100, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Figs.5, 6, and 7 plot the percentage of THD+noise in the Musical Fidelitys output against output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms, respectively. We define clipping as the power level at which the THD+N reaches 1%; these graphs confirm that the AMS100 meets its 100Wpc   specification into 8 ohms, but clips at 185Wpc into 4 ohms  . It also clips at 295Wpc into 2 ohms  . I dont hold the wall voltage constant for these tests; it was 120.2V AC with the amplifier quiescent, dropping slightly to 120.1V at clipping into 4 ohms with both channels driven or into 2 ohms with one channel driven. The downward slope of the traces in these graphs suggests that the actual distortion is buried under the noise floor right up to the point where the waveform begins to square, so I plotted how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 20V output, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The results are shown in  .8—the distortion is very low, at <0.001% at low and middle frequencies into the higher impedances, but it does rise above 1kHz, due to the usual reduction in negative feedback that results from the circuits restricted open-loop bandwidth. Even so, it is still just 0.011% at 20kHz.Fig.5 Musical Fidelity AMS100, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Musical Fidelity AMS100, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Musical Fidelity AMS100, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Fig.8 Musical Fidelity AMS100, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .I averaged 64 readings to examine the waveform of the THD+N spuriae, but even then, what appears to be mainly third-harmonic distortion is overlaid with noise  . FFT analysis   confirms that the subjectively innocuous third harmonic is predominant—if anything at –106dB   can be called \"predominant.\" High-frequency intermodulation distortion at the same peak signal level was also very low  , though it did begin to rise with even a small increase in power   or decrease in load impedance.Fig.9 Musical Fidelity AMS100, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms  , 0.00092% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Musical Fidelity AMS100, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Musical Fidelity AMS100, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Musical Fidelity AMS100, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 68W peak into 8 ohms  .Like other Musical Fidelity power amplifiers, the AMS100 offers excellent measured performance, especially very low static distortion. But the use of class-A bias for its output stage means that its impressive bulk conceals power delivery that is relatively modest when compared to that of its siblings.           ',\n",
       " '  NAD C 328    . Because class-D amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slew-rate limiting, all   with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz.Looking first at the line-level analog inputs: With the NADs volume control set to \"0.0dB,\" the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 25.6dB from the speaker terminals and 1.2dB from the headphone terminals. Increasing the volume setting to \"+12dB\" increased the gain by exactly 12dB from both sets of outputs. The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  , and the input impedance was 15k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly to 14.4k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone output impedance was a low 11.6 ohms at all audio frequencies, and the response was flat to 200kHz. The output impedance at the speaker terminals was 0.1 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising very slightly to 0.12 ohm at 20kHz. The output is flat into resistive loads  , rolling off above the audioband to reach –3dB at 45kHz, and any modulation of the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was within ±0.05dB  . The yellow and magenta traces in this graph show the response with Bass EQ activated. The low frequencies peak by just over 6dB at 80Hz, then roll off rapidly.Fig.1 NAD C 328, analog input, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , 8 ohms with Bass EQ engaged    .The C 328s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   reveals a slight, critically damped overshoot, with no ringing apparent. Channel separation was excellent, at 90dB in both directions between 800Hz and 2kHz, though this decreased at the frequency extremes, to 78dB at 20Hz and 63dB at 20kHz. Without the AP low-pass filter and with no signal present, about 212mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the speaker outputs. With the filter, the analog inputs shorted to ground, and the volume control set to \"0.0dB,\" the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured a superb 84.3dB. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 92.75dB, and an A-weighting filter increased it further, to 95dB.   Levels of any residual spuriae at the AC power-line frequency and its harmonics were extremely low  , but spurious tones were present at 280 and 720Hz. Although these are very low in level, I was surprised to see them.Fig.2 NAD C 328, analog input, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 NAD C 328, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The C 328 is specified as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 40Wpc into 8 ohms   or 4 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive in both channels the C 328 exceeded its specification, delivering 50Wpc into 8 ohms   and 56Wpc into 4 ohms  . Distortion levels at moderate powers were very low, and were consistent with both frequency and load impedance  . Although the shape of the spuriae waveform at 15Wpc into 8 ohms   is obscured by high-frequency noise, the distortion signature appears to be primarily second-harmonic in nature  . Though higher-order harmonics are visible in this graph, they all lie at or below –100dB  . Intermodulation distortion at high powers was extremely low, even into 4 ohms  . There is some peculiar spectral content present around 5kHz, though this is still very low in level.Fig.4 NAD C 328, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 NAD C 328, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 NAD C 328, analog input, distortion   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.7 NAD C 328, analog input, 1kHz waveform at 15W into 8 ohms, 0.0066% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 NAD C 328, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 NAD C 328, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .The phono input preserves absolute polarity and offers a maximum gain of 62dB at the speaker outputs, which is appropriate for moving-magnet cartridges. The input impedance was also appropriate for MM cartridges, at 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 39.5k ohms at 20kHz. The RIAA error was both very low and well matched between channels  . The phono inputs wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1kHz at 5mV, was excellent at 59.9dB, this improving to 73dB when A-weighted.Fig.10 NAD C 328, phono input, response with RIAA correction  .The phono inputs overload margins were also excellent, at >17dB across the audioband, and both harmonic distortion   and intermodulation distortion   were extremely low. However, some odd low-level spectral content was again apparent in the mid-treble region.Fig.11 NAD C 328, phono input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 5mV input  .Fig.12 NAD C 328, phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz  .The C 328s S/PDIF inputs preserved absolute polarity and locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz. A 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in an output level of 10V into 8 ohms with the volume control set to \"0.0,\" which suggests that the digital inputs have 6dB too much gain; ie, a digital signal at –6dB will just drive the amplifier into clipping into 8 ohms. This extra gain may well be useful with low-sensitivity headphones, however.The NADs impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing to either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the C 328s response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, but didnt reach full stop-band suppression until above the Nyquist frequency of 22.05kHz. An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   can therefore be seen, though this lies at –90dB  . However, the noise floor rises a little in the top audio octave and above. The distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor, the third harmonic being the highest in level at –74dB  .Fig.13 NAD C 328, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.14 NAD C 328, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .When  C 328s digital frequency response with S/PDIF data at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz, the response followed the same basic shape, with a sharp rolloff just below the two lower sample rates  . When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor dropped by almost 20dB, meaning that the C 328 offers more than 19 bits worth of resolution, which is excellent. However, a slight modulation of the noise floor can be seen in the mid-treble with 24-bit data  . With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a clean sinewave  .Fig.15 NAD C 328, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.16 NAD C 328, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.17 NAD C 328, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit S/PDIF data  .Fig.18 NAD C 328, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit S/PDIF data  .The NAD offered relatively low levels of intermodulation distortion via its digital inputs  , though the noise floor to either side of the high-level tones at 19 and 20kHz had a scalloped appearance. This same scalloped noise floor made an appearance when   C 328s rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit TosLink J-Test data  . It obscures the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave, and low-level sidebands can be seen at power-supply–related frequencies, as well as a higher-level pair of sidebands of unknown origin at ±1.7kHz.Fig.19 NAD C 328, digital input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.20 NAD C 328, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Overall, however, NADs C 328 offers a lot of good measured performance in an inexpensive package.           ',\n",
       " '  on one of the PS Audio Stellar M1200s  ,    . Because the Stellar M1200 features a class-D output stage, all the measurements other than the frequency response tests and one of the squarewave tests were taken with Audio Precisions AUX-0025 auxiliary passive low-pass filter, which eliminates much of the ultrasonic noise that might otherwise drive the analyzers input into slew-rate limiting. Without the filter, 373mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the amplifier output terminals.The Stellar M1200s voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was a little higher than usual, at 30.5dB with both balanced and unbalanced input signals.   Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , and the single-ended input impedance was 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, decreasing slightly and inconsequentially to 37.6k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was exactly twice these values, as expected. The output impedance   was very low, at 0.05 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 0.08 ohm at 20kHz.The gray trace in  .1 shows the Stellar M1200s small-signal frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker. The variations in response were a negligible ±0.05dB. Into resistive loads  , the amplifier rolled off above the audioband, with –3dB frequencies between 40kHz and 50kHz depend ing on the load resistance. The Stellar M1200s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured a slight amount of well-damped overshoot. This graph was taken with the auxiliary low-pass filter; it is absent when I repeated the test without the filter  , though the trace is now overlaid with ultrasonic noise.Fig.1 PS Audio Stellar M1200, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 PS Audio Stellar M1200, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision low-pass filter.Fig.3 PS Audio Stellar M1200, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms without Audio Precision low-pass filter.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   was okay, measuring 66.3dB. This ratio improved to 78.6dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband and 82.7dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor while the Stellar M1200 drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms   revealed that no AC-related spuriae were present, and that the S/N ratios were dominated by random noise components.Fig.4 PS Audio Stellar M1200, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The PS Audio met its specified output powers of 600W into 8 ohms and 1200W into 4 ohms  , clipping at 610W into 8 ohms   and 1200W into 4 ohms  . Fig.7 plots the percentage of THD+noise into 8, 4, and 2 ohms at a level, 20V  , at which I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise. The THD was very low at low and middle frequencies into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms   but rose into 2 ohms   and in the top two audio octaves.Fig.5 PS Audio Stellar M1200, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 PS Audio Stellar M1200, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 PS Audio Stellar M1200, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The distortion signature into 8 ohms was predominantly the relatively benign third harmonic  , which was low in level, lying at –83dB  . To my surprise, when I repeated the spectral analysis at the same voltage into 4 ohms  , the third harmonic disappeared and was replaced by the second harmonic at –87dB  . Higher harmonics now made an appearance, though these all lie at or below –100dB  . Despite the decreasing linearity at high frequencies seen in  .7, the M1200 performed well when driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms  . The 1kHz difference product lay at –94dB from the peak signal level  , and the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were a little lower in level.Fig.8 PS Audio Stellar M1200, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0063% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 PS Audio Stellar M1200, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 PS Audio Stellar M1200, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 PS Audio Stellar M1200, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .The PS Audio Stellar M1200s performance in the test lab indicates that it is a well-designed, well-engineered powerhouse.

       " 'I dont have the necessary equipment to test the Krell components in their current-mode   operation. Therefore, I performed all the technical tests using conventional voltage-mode drive, in both balanced and unbalanced operation.With its volume control set to \"151,\" the Evolution 202 preamplifier offered maximum voltage gains of 11.8dB in full balanced mode, 5.75dB in unbalanced mode. Both modes preserved absolute polarity; ie, were noninverting. The volume controls unity-gain setting was \"101\" for balanced operation, \"124\" for unbalanced. The unbalanced input impedance was a usefully high 38k ohms in the bass and midrange, dropping slightly but inconsequentially to 33k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was exactly twice the unbalanced, as expected. The output impedance was low, at 45 ohms balanced, 22.5 ohms unbalanced.The Evolution 202 offered a very wide bandwidth, its response down by just a quarter of a dB at 200kHz  . This didnt vary with volume-control setting or load impedance, and was identical in the balanced and unbalanced modes. There is a small rise in output at infrasonic frequencies, presumably a function of the DC servo. DC offset was negligible. Channel separation   was superb, at better than 110dB below 5kHz   and 198kHz  , with the volume control set to its maximum. Note, however, the slight peaks at 180Hz and 300Hz in this graph, possibly due to magnetic coupling from the power supply, which had to be placed directly under the preamp chassis for the testing due to the short umbilical cable. Even so, the levels of these spuriae are way too low to be audible, though they did reduce the worst-case, unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio to a still good 82.2dB  . A-weighting increased this  ure to a superb 95.7dB.Fig.1 Krell Evolution 202, balanced frequency response at 1V into  : 100k, 600 ohms  .Fig.2 Krell Evolution 202, channel separation in balanced   and unbalanced   modes  .The Krell preamp could swing very high output voltages, even into low impedances. Fig.3 reveals that the balanced output didnt clip   into 100k ohms until 16V RMS, with the unbalanced output clipping at 8V. These  ures are significantly higher than that required to drive the Evolution 600 power amplifier into clipping. More important, you can see in this graph how the actual distortion remains below the noise floor until 4V   and 2V  , which suggests that the preamps gain architecture has been sensibly optimized. I plotted the balanced THD percentage against frequency at 4V, the level suggested by  .3, but there was no difference in the preamps behavior across the audioband, and the THD remained very low even into the punishing 600 ohm load  .Fig.3 Krell Evolution 202, THD+N  vs 1kHz output voltage  : balanced into 100k ohms, 600 ohms; unbalanced into 100k, 10k, 1k, 600 ohms.Fig.4 Krell Evolution 202, balanced THD+N   vs frequency at 4V into  : 100k, 600 ohms  .And even with its very low level of distortion, the spectral content of that distortion was benign, with only the second and third harmonics rising above the residual level of my signal generator  . Intermodulation distortion was also low  .Fig.5 Krell Evolution 202, unbalanced spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1V into 8k ohms  .Fig.6 Krell Evolution 202, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 1V peak into 8k ohms  .  Evolution 600 power amplifier by running it at 200W into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that period, the THD+noise percentage had dropped from 0.0159% to 0.0064%, but the internally housed heatsinks were too hot to touch. The chassis itself was around 55°C at the rear, but cooler than that toward the front. Like the Evolution 202, the Evolution 600 monoblock was measured only in voltage mode. Its voltage gain   was a little lower than average, at 25.25dB, meaning that it needs almost 4V RMS from both its balanced and unbalanced inputs to be driven to its maximum output power. It preserved absolute polarity, and the input impedance was a high 90k ohms unbalanced, 200k ohms balanced.My measurement of the 600s output impedance was 0.124 ohm, which is higher than the specified  ure. My measurement does include 6 of cable, though this should account for no more than a small fraction of the difference. But this is still low enough that the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction between this impedance and that of the loudspeaker is negligible, at ±0.1dB  . This graph also reveals that the power amplifier has a wide small-signal bandwidth, though not as wide as the Evolution 202 preamplifier. The –3dB point lay at 116kHz, with a very-well-defined 10kHz squarewave the result  . The bandwidth did decrease slightly into 2 ohms, but was the same for balanced and unbalanced drive.Fig.7 Krell Evolution 600, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Krell Evolution 600, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.9 reveals that the Evolution 600 was a powerhouse, clipping with continuous drive at 610W into 8 ohms  , 1190W into 4 ohms  , and 2.2kW into 2 ohms  . I dont hold my AC wall voltage constant for these tests; at 125.8V with the amplifier quiescent, it had dropped to 121.8V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms, 119V with it clipping into 2 ohms. With its S/N ratio   of 81.7dB   improving to 92.3dB when A-weighted, the Evolution 600 offers a superbly wide dynamic range that well exceeds that of the 16-bit CD medium.Fig.9 Krell Evolution 600, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.I plotted the 600s THD+N percentage against frequency at 11V output, the level at which, as indicated in  .9, the distortion harmonics begin to rise out of the   noise floor. Even so, as  .10 reveals, though the percentage does rise with decreasing load impedance, it remains very low and constant with frequency at audio frequencies. And, as with the 202 preamplifier, the harmonic content of the 600s distortion remains low in order, almost entirely second- and third-harmonic in nature  , with no AC-supply spuriae visible even at high powers  . Intermodulation distortion was also very low, even at almost 800W into 4 ohms  !Fig.10 Krell Evolution 600, THD+N  vs frequency at 11V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.11 Krell Evolution 600, 1kHz waveform at 200W into 8 ohms  , 0.0065% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 Krell Evolution 600, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 213W into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 Krell Evolution 600, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 790W peak into 4 ohms  .Having had on my test bench in recent months a number of, shall I say, idiosyncratically engineered products, it was a pleasure to measure such a well-engineered pair of components as the Krell Evolution 202 and 600.

       " '  of the Bryston 3B-ST using its unbalanced inputs, with selected measurements repeated in the balanced mode, as noted below.Following its 1/3-power, one-hour preconditioning test, the 3B-STs heatsinks were very hot, though not outside the normal range of temperatures usually encountered in this test. The 3B-ST is non-inverting when driven from its positive, unbalanced input; at the balanced, XLR input terminal, pin 2 is positive as specified. DC offset measured 5.5mV in the left channel, 4.1mV in the right.The Bryston 3B-STs input impedance measured 49.7k ohms  . The output impedance measured under 0.03 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing to a maximum of 0.09 ohms at 20kHz. Voltage gain measured 29.2dB  . The unweighted signal/noise   measured 92dB over a 22Hz-22kHz bandwidth, 83dB over a 10Hz-500kHz bandwidth. The A-weighted  ure was 95dB. The corresponding  ures for balanced drive were all just under 1dB worse   in all cases.Fig.1 shows the small-signal frequency response of the 3B-ST  . There is little worthy of comment here. The same is true of the 10kHz squarewave response  , which is virtually textbook, with good risetime, and no overshoot or ringing  .Fig.1 Bryston 3B-ST, frequency response at  : 2W into 4 ohms, 1W into 8 ohms, and 2.83V into simulated speaker load  .Fig.2 Bryston 3B-ST, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 shows the 3B-STs crosstalk. The difference between the two channels should be of no audible consequence at such high absolute separation levels.Fig.3 Bryston 3B-ST, crosstalk  : L-R, R-L  .The manner in which the Brystons THD+noise varies with frequency is shown in  .4. The THD of the Bryston is so low that I used 10 times our normal output power for this measurement to get results which were not obscured by noise. Note that for the simulated real load, I measured at an output of 8.9V—a small change from our recent practice.  .Fig.4 Bryston 3B-ST, THD+noise vs frequency at  : 40W into 2 ohms, 20W into 4 ohms, 8.9V into simulated speaker load, and 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.5 compares the THD+noise in unbalanced and balanced modes; note that the unbalanced is lower—though both are very low).Fig.5 Bryston 3B-ST, THD+noise vs frequency at  : 10W into 8 ohms, balanced; and 10W into 8 ohms, unbalanced  .The waveform of the distortion at 25W into 2 ohms is shown in  .6. It is heavily third harmonic, with some noise. The waveforms   into 4 and 8 ohm were similar, though with higher powers required to get a significant reading above the low levels of noise.Fig.6 Bryston 3B-ST, 1kHz waveform at 25W into 2 ohms  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .The 3B-STs output spectrum reproducing 50Hz at 154W into 4 ohms is shown in  .7. The distortion products are all extremely low in level—below -90dB or 0.003%. At an output of 31.2V into our simulated real load  , I obtained the result shown in  .8. Only the third harmonic   is in any way relevant, though other artifacts at less than -80dB are visible.Fig.7 Bryston 3B-ST, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC-1kHz, at 154W into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Bryston 3B-ST, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC-1kHz, at 31.2V into simulated loudspeaker load  .

While clearly more IM products were produced into the 4 ohm load, in all cases the artifacts are very low in level—below -80dB  .Fig.9 Bryston 3B-ST, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-22kHz, 19+20kHz at 70.5W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Bryston 3B-ST, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-22kHz, 19+20kHz at 117W into 4 ohms  .The way in which the 3B-STs THD+noise varies with output power   is shown in  .11. The discrete clipping levels for the 3B-ST are shown in Table 1. Into 8 ohms, bridged, the 3B-ST reached clipping   at 453W  . Note that the 3B-STs power supply is starting to give up into a 2 ohm load. It will drive the load, but at considerably reduced power.Fig.11 Bryston 3B-ST, distortion   vs output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, and 2 ohms.The Bryston 3B-ST produced a solid set of measurements, especially notable for its low distortion, noise, and crosstalk. I would not choose this amplifier to drive a loudspeaker which hovered around 2 ohms for most of the audible range, but fortunately such loudspeakers are rare.—Thomas J. NortonFootnote 1: Why 31.2V?. As is noted above, the impedance of the simulated load varies across the frequency range, making interpretation of the result difficult if we relate the output to power. I therefore measured the voltage at which the amplifier clipped at 1kHz into the simulated real load  , 38V in this case, and took the measurement at 82% of this. Why 82%? Because we normally take the reading at 67% of rated power, and power is proportional to the square of the voltage—0.82 squared is 0.67.—Thomas J. Norton          ',\n",
       " '  Moon Evolution 860A      . As the amplifier is specified as having a maximum power output of 200Wpc into 8 ohms,   it before the measurements by running it at one-third that power, 67W, into 8 ohms for an hour. Following that period, the heatsinks were warm, at 110.2°F  . The THD+noise percentage at this power level was 0.0126% with the amplifier cold, 0.0115% with it fully warm.The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was higher than the norm, at 31.3dB with both balanced and unbalanced input signals, and the 860A preserved absolute polarity   for both inputs.   The unbalanced input impedance was to specification at 46.3k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping slightly to 34k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedances were twice these values, as expected. The output impedance, including 6 of speaker cable, was very low, at 0.09 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.11 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the variation in response due to the interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.075dB  .The frequency response was perfectly flat in the audioband, and down by 3dB at 120kHz into 8 ohms  . As a result, the Moon amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was essentially perfect, with no overshoot or ringing  . Channel separation   was >100dB in both directions at and below 1kHz, and was still 80dB L–R and 87dB R–L at 20kHz. Though some spuriae were present in the 860As output at the mains frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics  , these were all at or below –130dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms. The wide, unweighted signal/noise ratio with the input shorted to ground was 85.7dB  , improving to 92.7dB with the measurement bandwidth restricted to the audioband, and to 95.1dB when A-weighted. Despite its higher-than-usual gain, the 860A is a quiet amplifier.Fig.1 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms left hannel blue, right red) and at 100W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 4, 5, and 6 show how the percentage of THD+N in the Moon Evolution 860As output varied with output power into, respectively, 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The downward slope of the traces in these graphs below 10W or so indicates that the actual distortion lies below the already low noise floor at low powers. The gentle rise in THD+N above 10W suggests that the circuit uses only a modest amount of negative feedback, though there is a sharp knee when actual waveform clipping starts to occur.Fig.4 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The Moon Evolution 860A is specified as being able to deliver 200Wpc into 8 ohms or 400Wpc into 4 ohms, both powers equivalent to 23dBW. However,  s.4–6 indicate that, with our usual definition of clipping as the power when the THD+N reaches 1%, the Simaudio delivers 180Wpc into 8 ohms   or 290W into 4 ohms  , both  ures taken with both channels driven; or 465W into 2 ohms  , one channel driven. The wall AC voltage was 122.6V with no signal being amplified, and 121.3V at the clipping point into 4 or 2 ohms, so that doesnt explain the slight shortfall in maximum output power. Even so, the Moon Evolution 860A is still a very powerful amplifier.Measured at 12.67V—equivalent to 20Wpc into 8 ohms, 40Wpc into 4 ohms, or 80W into 2 ohms—the THD+N percentage remained very low into higher impedances, and the rise of THD in the top two octaves was mild  . The amplifier was clearly less comfortable driving high frequencies at this power level into 2 ohms, though the THD+N remains below 0.1%. The distortion signature, primarily a mix of the second and third harmonics  , remains low in level even at very high powers into 4 ohms  . Intermodulation distortion at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen was also low  , the difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 200W peak into 4 ohms lying at –86dB  .Fig.7 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.67V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, 1kHz waveform at 15W into 8 ohms, 0.005% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Simaudio Moon Evolution 860A, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Other than the slight shortfall in maximum power output, the Moon Evolution 860A lives up to Simaudios reputation for excellent audio engineering.

       " '  PS Audio Stellar M700    .  s of an amplifier, I usually precondition it by running it at one-third the clipping power into 8 ohms for an hour. As the Stellar M700 has a class-D output stage, this was not necessary. But I did take the temperature of its case: the top panel was slightly warm, at 80°F  . The voltage gain into 8 ohms was 30.5dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs, and the M700 preserved absolute polarity   for both inputs, meaning that the XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot.The unbalanced input impedance was close to the specified 50k ohms, measuring 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, and dropping inconsequentially to 35k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced impedance, as expected. The output impedance   was low, at 0.1 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz. However, the output impedance was actually negative at the top of the audioband, perhaps due to the behavior of the necessary low-pass filter. The action of this filter can be seen in  .1, which rolls off the output very sharply above 50kHz, with the actual frequency of the response \"knee\" dependent on the load impedance. The variation in frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker was small, at less than ±0.1dB  , but there is an implication of an ultrasonic resonance developing with loads of higher impedance. This gave rise to a small degree of overshoot and one cycle of damped ringing with a 10kHz squarewave  .Fig.1 PS Audio Stellar M700, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 PS Audio Stellar M700, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with AP AUX-0025 low-pass filter.As the M700 is a class-D design, all   with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz that might otherwise overload the SYS2722s input circuitry. Without the filter, 877mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the speaker terminals, with a center frequency of 465kHz.   This noise can be seen riding on the waveform of a 1kHz sinewave when I didnt use the filter  . With the Audio Precision filter, the Stellar M700 produced relatively low levels of noise in the audioband, with no trace of AC-supply harmonics  . The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 66dB, improving to a respectable 81.7dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 84dB when A-weighted.Fig.3 PS Audio Stellar M700, small-signal 1kHz waveform into 8 ohms without AP AUX-0025 low-pass filter.Fig.4 PS Audio Stellar M700, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .We define clipping as when the percentage of THD+noise in the amplifiers output reaches 1%, and  .5 indicates that the M700 slightly exceeds its specified power of 350W into 8 ohms  . Into 4 ohms  , the M700 clips at precisely the specified 700W  . Fig.7 plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at a level at which I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise: 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD is very low at low and middle frequencies into 8 and 4 ohms, but does rise into 2 ohms and at high frequencies. The distortion signature primarily comprises the relatively benign third harmonic   and lies at just –80dB  , even at 200W into 4 ohms  . Intermodulation distortion at the same high power was also very low  .Fig.5 PS Audio Stellar M700, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 PS Audio Stellar M700, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 PS Audio Stellar M700, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 PS Audio Stellar M700, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.0063% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 PS Audio Stellar M700, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 PS Audio Stellar M700, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .PS Audios Stellar M700 packs a lot of power into a small, cool-running case, and offers respectable measured performance.

       " '  CH Precision I1 Universal amplifier    .  ing, I connected the amplifiers Ethernet port to my network, then ran it at one-third power into 8 ohms. At the end of that period its top panel was warm, at 107.8°F  , and the front-panel display indicated that the internal temperature was 63°C  .  I wasnt able to test the CH I1s phono stage because its current-mode input didnt appear to be compatible with the Audio Precisions voltage-mode output. Looking first at the line-level analog inputs: With the volume control at its maximum setting—the default setting is \"0dB,\" though additional gain up to 24dB can be selected for each input via the menu—the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms from the speaker terminals measured a low 22.53dB for the balanced input but 29dB for the unbalanced inputs.   The line inputs preserved absolute polarity   from all outputs. The unbalanced input impedance was 44k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to 23k ohms at 20kHz. As expected, the balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced value. The preamplifier output offered an insertion loss of 0.7dB, with an appropriately low output impedance of 72 ohms across the audioband.The output impedance at the speaker terminals   varied according to the amount of global negative feedback selected with the menu. With global negative feedback set to 100%, the output impedance was 0.11 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.15 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modulation of the I1s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.1dB  . Reducing the feedback level to 60% increased the impedance to 0.23 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, 0.27 ohm at 20kHz. With 40% feedback, the respective impedances were 0.3 and 0.32 ohm. With no global feedback, the impedance was 0.40 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, 0.44 ohm at 20kHz, and the modulation of the frequency response was now ±0.2dB  .Fig.1 CH Precision I1, analog input, 100% feedback, volume control at max, digitized frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  ; Bypass frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms    .Fig.2 CH Precision I1, analog input, 0% feedback, volume control at max, digitized frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .An unusual aspect of these two response graphs is that the amplifiers output drops sharply above 35kHz. I had understood that in Normal mode, the I1 digitizes its analog line inputs at 384kHz—but  s. 1 and 2 suggest that the sample rate is actually 88.2 or 96kHz. There is nothing in the manual about changing the sample rate for the analog inputs, nor do the front-panel or Android-tablet setup menus offer options for this. I did wonder if the sample rate was somehow affected by that of the data present at the digital inputs; however, even with, for example, the AES/EBU input receiving 192kHz data, the analog digitizing sampling remained at the lower rate. When I set the balanced input to Bypass, which eliminates the digitizing  , I got the frequency response shown as the blue and yellow traces in  .1. It extends significantly higher in frequency, not reaching –3dB until 100kHz.   In Normal mode, the digitization affects the shapes of 1kHz   and 10kHz   squarewaves.Fig.3 CH Precision I1, analog input, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.4 CH Precision I1, analog input, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >110dB in both directions below 2kHz, decreasing to 80dB at 20kHz. With the analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured 62.6dB in both channels. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 83.3dB, and an A-weighting filter increased it further, to 86.0dB. Levels of residual spuriae at the AC power-line frequency and its odd-order harmonics, presumably due to magnetic coupling from the massive power transformer, were very low  .Fig.5 CH Precision I1, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .CH Precision specifies the I1 as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive in both channels, the CH exceeded that spec, delivering 120Wpc into 8 ohms  . With both channels driven into 4 ohms  , the I1 clipped at 210W  , compared with the specified power into this load of 175Wpc  . Fig.6 was taken with 100% global feedback; the actual distortion is below the noise floor until the power reaches 50W or so. Repeating the 8 and 4 ohm tests with 0% feedback gave the same clipping power, but with about 20 times higher distortion below clipping  .Fig.6 CH Precision I1, analog input, 100% feedback, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.7 CH Precision I1, analog input, 100% feedback, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.8 CH Precision I1, analog input, 0% feedback, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.9 CH Precision I1, analog input, 0% feedback, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms, both channels driven.With the amplifier set to 100% feedback, I measured its THD+N percentage against frequency at a level of 12.65V, which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms, 40W into 4 ohms, and 80W into 2 ohms. The distortion levels were low even into 2 ohms  , and, perhaps more important, didnt rise by much at higher frequencies. This was also true when the I1 was set to 0% feedback, though the distortion levels were again around 20 times higher  .Fig.10 CH Precision I1, analog input, 100% feedback, distortion   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.11 CH Precision I1, analog input, 0% feedback, distortion   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The shapes of the distortion-spuriae waveforms   suggest that the third harmonic was the highest in level, but with higher-order harmonics present with zero feedback. Spectral analysis indicated that with 100% feedback the second and third harmonics were equal in level, though at –104dB   both are negligible  . With 0% feedback, the higher-order harmonics are present at much higher levels  . Both second-order and higher-order intermodulation products at 20Wpc into 8 ohms with 100% feedback were negligible  . All the IM products increased as I reduced the feedback level, and with 0% feedback the second-order product reached a still-low –80dB    .Fig.12 CH Precision I1, analog input, 100% feedback, 1kHz waveform at 40W into 8 ohms, 0.0024% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.13 CH Precision I1, analog input, 0% feedback, 1kHz waveform at 40W into 8 ohms, 0.048% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.14 CH Precision I1, analog input, 100% feedback, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.15 CH Precision I1, analog input, 0% feedback, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.16 CH Precision I1, analog input, 100% feedback, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.17 CH Precision I1, analog input, 0% feedback, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Turning to the digital inputs, the I1ss AES/EBU and coaxial S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz. The optical input topped out at 96kHz. All digital inputs preserved absolute polarity. Apples USB Prober utility identified the I1 as \"CH Precision USB Audio 2.0\" from \"CH Precision,\" and confirmed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the I1s USB port could handle 16- and 24-bit integer data at all sample rates up to 384kHz. With the volume control set to its normal maximum of \"0dB,\" a 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in output levels of 1.36V at the balanced preamp outputs and 20.55V into 8 ohms at the speaker outputs. The front-panel display indicated that the amplifier was clipping with digital data higher in level than –11dBFS. Therefore, I continued testing the digital inputs from the balanced preamplifier outputs with the volume control set to \"–12dB.\"The CHs impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that its reconstruction filter is a very short linear-phase type, with just a couple of cycles of ringing to either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. The manual says that the I1s reconstruction filter can be set to linear phase or minimum phase. However, neither the front-panel display nor the Android app offered a menu item for switching between the two reconstruction filters. Perhaps this choice will be the subject of a firmware update.Fig.18 CH Precision I1, digital input, impulse response  .With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise upsampled to 352.8kHz  , the I1s response rolled off slowly above the audioband, not reaching full stop-band suppression until an octave above the Nyquist frequency of 22.05kHz  . The aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   is suppressed by only 10dB, though almost no other aliasing products are present. The CH Precisions digital frequency response with AES/EBU data at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz followed the same basic shape at each sample rate, with a slow rolloff that reached –3dB at 20kHz with 44.1kHz data  . Some passband ripples present in the top audio octave with 44.1kHz data are absent at the higher sample rates.Fig.19 CH Precision I1, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.20 CH Precision I1, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor dropped by about 15dB, meaning that the I1 offers between 17 and 18 bits worth of resolution. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical, though some HF noise was present. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a slightly noisy sinewave  .Fig.21 CH Precision I1, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.22 CH Precision I1, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.23 CH Precision I1, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Intermodulation distortion via the I1s digital inputs was extremely low  .

       " 'I measured Myteks Brooklyn Amp    . Before I test a class-AB amplifier, I usually precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. As the Brooklyn Amp has class-D output modules, such preconditioning is irrelevant. However, the Mytek did get warm in use: after an hour or so, the temperature of the top panel was 107.4°F  . As class-D amplifiers produce RF noise that could drive my analyzers input circuitry into slew-rate limiting, between the test load and the analyzer I inserted Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz.The Brooklyn Amp is specified as having a voltage gain of 23 or 29dB, selectable with one of the rear-panel DIP switches. However, the relevant switch had no effect. Frustrated, I downloaded Myteks Control app from their website and ran it on my laptop, which was connected to the Brooklyns USB port.   The app offered a choice of \"0dB\" or \"6dB\"—at those settings, the balanced gain into 8 ohms measured very close to the respective specifications of 22.9 and 28.9dB. The respective unbalanced gains were 18.2 and 21.2dB—note the difference between them of 3dB rather than the expected 6dB.Both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  , and the input impedance, specified as 10k ohms, was 19.8k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz for the balanced inputs, and 17k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz for the unbalanced inputs, the latter dropping slightly at 20kHz, to 15k ohms. The output impedance, including a 6, spaced-pair speaker cable, was very low at 0.06 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, but rose to 0.3 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modulation of the Brooklyn Amps frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was very small in the midrange, but reached +0.25dB at the top of the audioband before rapidly rolling off above 25kHz  . The top-octave boost was less well developed into 8 ohms  , and the response rolled off earlier into lower impedances. It was down by 1dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . The slight boost at 20kHz into higher impedances is presumably due to the low-pass filter on the class-D stages output; the boost is associated with a slight degree of leading-edge overshoot with a 10kHz squarewave  , but the overshoot is critically damped, with no ringing evident.Fig.1 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz, and still 70dB at the top of the audioband. Without the AP low-pass filter there was 315mV of ultrasonic noise present on the Myteks output. With the AP filter, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the inputs shorted to ground, was a high 76.1dB   ref. 1W into 8 ohms. The S/N ratio improved to a very good 84.9dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 87.9dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. Other than the inevitable ultrasonic noise produced by a class-D design, this is a quiet amplifier. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor   revealed no AC-supply–related harmonics.Fig.3 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Defining clipping as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1%, Mytek specifies the Brooklyn Amp as clipping at 250Wpc into 8 ohms  , at 300Wpc into 4 ohms  , and at 400Wpc into 2 ohms  . I measured clipping powers of 245W into 8 ohms   and 315Wpc into 4 ohms  , both with both channels driven. However, when I tried to measure the clipping power into 2 ohms, the Mytek went into protection mode at 310W  , with any further increase in the input voltage not resulting in a higher output power. But considering that this power was being produced by a small box weighing less than 7 lb, I dont think this is an issue that will be of any concern in practical use with speakers whose impedance doesnt drop below 3 ohms.Fig.4 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I examined how the Brooklyns percentage of THD+N varied with frequency at 20V  . The THD+N was extremely low in the bass and midrange into both impedances  , with the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in open-loop voltage gain as the frequency increases. However, I couldnt plot how the THD+N changed into 2 ohms, as the amplifier turned off its outputs after a few seconds of operating at this level. It turned itself on again as soon as I reduced the level of the input signal.Fig.6 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The THD+N waveform at 160Wpc into 8 ohms   is difficult to interpret, due to the presence of audioband noise. However, looking at the waveform on an analog scope, which averages out most of the noise, indicated that the distortion signature is primarily third harmonic in nature. This was confirmed by spectral analysis of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  , with the second and higher-order harmonics all lying below –100dB  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with the signal peaking at 100Wpc into 4 ohms, the Mytek produced low levels of intermodulation distortion  , with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –110dB  , and the higher-order products at or below –84dB  .Fig.7 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, 1kHz waveform at 160W into 8 ohms, 0.1% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Mytek Brooklyn Amp, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .Myteks Brooklyn Amp is a tiny powerhouse offering respectable measured performance.

       " ' ,   Classé CA-3200 by running it for 60 minutes at one-third power with all three channels driven into 8 ohms. At the end of that time, the THD+noise had dropped from 0.0024% to 0.00195%, but the top panel and the heatsinks were way too hot to touch, the curved front panel was around 50°C, and a noticeable draft of hot air rose from the top-panel vents over the center channels internal heatsink. If this amplifier is to be used in a custom installation, it should be well ventilated.The voltage gain into 8 ohms was to specification at 29dB and well matched across the three channels. The amplifier was non-inverting   for both unbalanced and balanced input signals; the XLRs for the latter are wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance for the unbalanced jacks was 70–75k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz, and exactly double that for the balanced inputs.The output impedance was a very low 0.047 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising slightly but inconsequentially to 0.075 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, any modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the way in which the partnering loudspeakers impedance changes with frequency will be minimal. For example, with our standard simulated speaker, the response changed by just ±0.05dB  . The amplifiers response was flat to 20kHz into 8 and 4 ohms, but dropped by 0.2dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms. The small-signal bandwidth was wide, the –3dB point into 8 ohms lying at 150kHz for both balanced and unbalanced drive. Correlating with that, the waveform of a 10kHz squarewave showed very small risetimes with only the faintest hint of overshoot  .Fig.1 Classé CA-3200, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.2 Classé CA-3200, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The CA-3200s channel separation   was better than 95dB between all possible pairs of channels at 1kHz. It did decrease at the frequency extremes, however. The amplifiers wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   was good rather than great, at 73.9dB balanced and 71.2dB unbalanced. Reducing the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz improved both ratios to 91.4dB, while switching in an A-weighting filter gave further improvement, to 93.9dB.Fig.3 Classé CA-3200, channel separation  : L–C  , C–L  ; L–R  , R–L  ; C–R  , R–C    .With one channel driven, the CA-3200 easily exceeded its specified output power  . With clipping defined as 1% THD+N, the Classé clipped at 250W into 8 ohms   and 450W into 4 ohms  . The 2 ohm trace in this graph cuts off at 661W  , which is when the CA-3200 went into protection and the active channels front-panel blue LED blinked red. After resetting the amplifier, I determined that the overload had done no damage.Fig.4 Classé CA-3200, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms, one channel driven.The shapes of the traces in  .4 indicates that the distortion remains under the noise floor below a few tens of watts, so I plotted how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 17V RMS. The results are shown in  .5: while the THD remains very low below 1kHz even into 2 ohms, it does rise at higher frequencies, presumably due to the decrease in the circuits open-loop gain at high frequencies. However, the THD level is still low in absolute terms.Fig.5 Classé CA-3200, THD+N  vs frequency at 17V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms  .At low frequencies, the CA-3200s distortion content was predominantly second and third harmonic  . But at higher currents and frequencies, not only did the third harmonic increase in level  , but some higher-order harmonics appeared  . Even so, intermodulation distortion was very low, even at an output level just below visual clipping on the oscilloscope screen  .Fig.6 Classé CA-3200, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.7 Classé CA-3200, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Classé CA-3200, 1kHz waveform at 140W into 2 ohms  , 0.0058% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Classé CA-3200, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 255W peak into 4 ohms  .Overall, this is excellent measured performance, though the increase in high-order THD at high current levels did raise my eyebrows.

       " '  Luxman M-10X  .   amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the grilles over the internal heatsinks were hot, at 120.6°F  , though the top panel was just warm at 90.9°F  . Operating the amplifier for another 30 minutes at one-third the specified power, a level that results in the maximum heat dissipation in the output devices, increased the temperatures only slightly. The M-10X has sufficient heatsink capacity for its rated power.The Luxmans voltage gain is specified as 29dB, presumably into 8 ohms, which was confirmed by my measurements. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with the unbalanced input and the rear-panel Phase Inversion switch set to Normal. However, the M-10X inverted polarity with the balanced input with the Normal setting of the switch, which implies that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 3 positive rather than pin 2, the opposite of the AES convention.  The balanced input impedance was usefully high, at 54k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to 26k ohms at 20kHz. The lower-frequency impedances are almost twice the specified 28k ohms, which suggests that the latter refers to the impedance of each signal phase. The unbalanced input impedance was 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies, rising to the specified 51k ohms at the top of the audioband.The Luxmans output impedance was a very low 0.06 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.09 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was negligible, at ±0.1dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB just above 100kHz and flat to 20kHz, which correlates with the M-10Xs superb reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . Commendably, there was no overshoot or ringing in the squarewave response.Fig.1 Luxman M-10X, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  ), 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Luxman M-10X, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was close to 90dB in both directions below 2kHz, dropping insignificantly to 80dB at the top of the audioband. Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was an excellent 83dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  . This ratio improved to 93.8dB when the measurement was A-weighted and to 115.6dB when referenced to the amplifiers specified maximum power. This is very close to the specification of 117dB . Spuriae at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its harmonics were present in the Luxmans noisefloor   but were negligible at close to –100dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Luxman M-10X, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .In stereo mode—I didnt look at the amplifiers behavior in bridged-mono mode—the Luxman M-10X is specified as being able to deliver 150Wpc into 8 ohms and 300W into 4 ohms  . With both channels driven and using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the Luxman exceeded its specified powers, clipping with a 1kHz signal at 202W into 8 ohms   and at 350W into 4 ohms  . At 1W into 8 ohms, the front-panel meters indicated \"–25dB\" ref. 0dB, and at 50W into 8 ohms they indicated \"–9dB.\"Fig.4 Luxman M-10X, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Luxman M-10X, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The shape of the traces in  s.4 and 5 suggests that the measured THD+N percentage below 20W is dominated by noise. I therefore examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms. The THD+N was very low in the bass and midrange into 8 and 4 ohms   then rising at higher frequencies, more so into 4 ohms   than into 8 ohms  . Nevertheless, the THD+N only reached the specified 0.04% with 20kHz at 100W into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Luxman M-10X, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The Luxmans distortion was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  , with the third harmonic a little lower in level  . This spectrum was taken with the amplifier driving 50Wpc into 8 ohms; the second harmonic in the left channel lay at a low –103dB  . With a 1kHz signal at 100Wpc into 4 ohms, it rose to a still very low –90dB  . When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 8 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –100dB  , with higher-order intermodulation products close to the same level. At the same voltage into 4 ohms, these distortion products only rose slightly in level.Fig.7 Luxman M-10X, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.002% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Luxman M-10X, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.8 Luxman M-10X, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Luxman M-10X, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .The Luxman M-10X offers superb measured performance.

       " '  Mark Levinson No.532H, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . Before testing the No.532H, I ran it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour, which maximally stresses a class-A/B amplifiers ability to shed waste heat. At the end of this preconditioning period the No.532Hs top panel was warm, at 108°F  , though the exposed tops of the internal heatsinks measured 168°F  . This amplifier needs plenty of ventilation. The THD+noise present in the cold amplifiers output was 0.0019%; with the amplifier hot, this rose to a still very low 0.006%.The voltage gain into 8 ohms was to specifications: at 26.8dB using the balanced inputs, and slightly higher, 27.2dB, using the unbalanced inputs. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was slightly higher than specified, at 32.5k ohms unbalanced and 63k ohms balanced. However, these  ures dropped to 13k and 31k ohms at 20kHz, respectively.The output impedance, including the series resistance of 6 of speaker cable, was very low, at <0.08 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.16 ohm at 20kHz. The variation in the amplifiers frequency response, due to the interaction between this impedance and how that of the speaker varies with frequency, is therefore also very low, at ±0.1dB  . The No.532Hs output drops by 0.5dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  , but the response into higher impedances is –3dB at >100kHz, which correlates with the short risetimes with a 10kHz squarewave  . The 10kHz squarewave response is free from overshoot and ringing, and the low-frequency squarewave is essentially perfect  .Fig.1 Mark Levinson No.532H, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Mark Levinson No.532H, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Mark Levinson No.532H, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was >100dB in both directions below 1kHz, and at 20kHz was still 81dB   and 85dB  . The No.532H is also superbly quiet; its wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V output with the input short-circuited, measured 93dB in both channels.   With its high output power, the No.532H is one of the few amplifiers that can match the dynamic range of true high-resolution recordings.Fig.4 shows how the THD+N percentage in the No.532Hs output varies with output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The THD starts to rise above 28V RMS into each load, but actual clipping occurs significantly higher in level. Defining clipping as 1% THD+N, the No.532H clips at 355Wpc into 8 ohms  , at 500Wpc into 4 ohms  , and, with one channel driven, at 660W into 2 ohms  . The amplifier turned itself off at 671W into 2 ohms, but turned itself back on again when the drive signal was reduced. Though the distortion at lower frequencies is extremely low even at moderate power levels  , it does start to rise in the treble. This is due to the circuits restricted open-loop bandwidth reducing the amount of corrective negative feedback applied as the frequency rises. However, the distortion at 20kHz is still very low, even into 2 ohms  .Fig.4 Mark Levinson No.532H, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.5 Mark Levinson No.532H, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Though low in level, the distortion comprises both low and high orders  . At high currents, the third harmonic begins to predominate  . Though the higher-order spuriae are still present, their levels are very low, even close to visual waveform clipping on an oscilloscope  . Intermodulation distortion is also extremely low, even at very high power  .Fig.6 Mark Levinson No.532H, 1kHz waveform at 30W into 4 ohms  , 0.0028% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Mark Levinson No.532H, 1kHz waveform at 45W into 2 ohms  , 0.0053% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Mark Levinson No.532H, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 275W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Mark Levinson No.532H, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 260W peak into 4 ohms  .With its high power output and very low levels of noise and distortion, the Mark Levinson No.532H offers textbook measured performance.

       " 'Other than \"+\" appended to the name on the amplifiers top and bottom plates, the Brooklyn AMP+ appears identical to the original Brooklyn AMP that was reviewed in the September 2018 issue. I summed up the earlier amplifiers behavior on the test bench by writing \"Myteks Brooklyn AMP is a tiny powerhouse offering respectable measured performance.\" I used my   system   to test the Brooklyn AMP+. Like its predecessor, the AMP+ has an output stage operating in class-D, so I inserted Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter between the test load and the analyzer. This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slew-rate limiting, and I used it for all the tests other than frequency response.The Brooklyn AMP+ is specified as having a voltage gain of 23 or 29dB, selectable with one of the rear-panel DIP switches.   The voltage gain into 8 ohms measured very close to the specification at 22.9dB and 28.9dB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs. In Bridged mode, the gain was 6dB higher in both gain settings, as expected.Both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity   in Normal mode, and the Bridged mode was noninverting when the positive output was taken from the left channels positive output terminal. The input impedance was 19.8k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz for the balanced inputs, and 17k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz for the unbalanced inputs, the latter dropping slightly at 20kHz, to 15k ohms. The output impedance in Normal mode, including a 6, spaced-pair speaker cable, was very low at 0.085 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, but rose to 0.3 ohms at 20kHz. As a result, the modulation of the Brooklyn AMP+s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was very small in the audioband  . Into 8 ohms  , the response peaked by +0.9dB between 40kHz and 50kHz, before rapidly rolling off to reach –3dB at 80kHz.   The ultrasonic peak, which is due to the passive low-pass filter that follows the amplifiers class-D output stage, was absent into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms  . The response into 2 ohms was down by 0.7dB at 20kHz.Fig.1 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .The ultrasonic peak into higher impedances is associated with a slight degree of leading-edge overshoot with a 10kHz squarewave  , but the overshoot is critically damped, with no ringing evident. Channel separation was excellent, at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz, and still 73dB at the top of the audioband. Without the AP low-pass filter there was 98mV of ultrasonic noise present on the Myteks output, which is significantly lower than with the original Brooklyn AMP, which had 315mV of noise present. With the AP filter, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the single-ended inputs shorted to ground, was 78.5dB   ref. 1W into 8 ohms. The S/N ratio improved to a very good 84dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 86.8dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. Other than the inevitable ultrasonic noise produced by a class-D design, this is a quiet amplifier. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor   revealed no AC-supply–related harmonics.Fig.2 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision AUX-0025 low-pass filter.Fig.3 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Myteks website specifies the amplifiers maximum power as 250Wpc into 8 ohms  , 300Wpc into 4 ohms  , and 400Wpc into 2 ohms  . Defining clipping as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1%,   clipping power with both channels driven into 8 ohms as 265W  . However, when I tried to measure the clipping power into 4 ohms, the Mytek went into protection mode at 210.4Wpc into 4 ohms  . Similarly, the AMP+ went into protection mode at 103.7W into 2 ohms  . In both cases, the amplifier turned itself on again as soon as I reduced the level of the input signal.Fig.4 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I examined how the Brooklyns THD+N percentage varied with frequency at 20V  . The THD+N was extremely low in the bass and midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  , with the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in open-loop voltage gain as the frequency increased. Note the higher level of distortion with the right channel driving 4 ohms   than the left  . This graph doesnt show how the THD+N percentage varied into 2 ohms, as the amplifier went into protection at this output voltage.Fig.6 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  .The THD+N waveform at 50Wpc into 8 ohms   suggests that the distortion signature is primarily third harmonic in nature. This was confirmed by spectral analysis of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  . The third harmonic was a little higher in the right channel  , but the second and higher-order harmonics all lay at or below –100dB  . As implied by  .6, when I drove the 50Hz tone at the same voltage into 4 ohms the third harmonic increased in level in the right channel but was still relatively low at –74dB  .Fig.7 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.003% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Despite the decrease in top-octave linearity shown in  .6, when tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones and the signal peaking at 100Wpc into 4 ohms, the Mytek produced low levels of intermodulation distortion  . The difference product at 1kHz lay at –94dB   in the left channel   and at –100dB   in the right channel  . The higher-order intermodulation products all lay close to or below –80dB  .Fig.10 Mytek Brooklyn AMP+, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .Like its predecessor, Myteks Brooklyn AMP+ is indeed a tiny powerhouse. It matched the measured performance of the original Brooklyn AMP in most ways but with a wider small-signal bandwidth and a lower level of ultrasonic noise. Even with its hair-trigger protection circuit, it will offer sufficient power into low-impedance loudspeakers with music signals.           ',\n",
       " '  Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M amplifiers   for an hour at one-third its specified maximum power of 800W into 8 ohms, thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B output stage. By the end of the hour, the side-mounted heatsinks were way too hot to touch, at 148.5°F  . The chassis was cooler, with the top plate measuring 126.4°F  , though the aluminum vertical corner pieces were 164.3°F  . Though the distortion with the amplifier completely cold was a low 0.00825%, this was predominantly crossover distortion, which will be subjectively disturbing because of its high proportion of high-order harmonics. At the end of the preconditioning period, the distortion had almost halved, to 0.0045%, and the crossover spuriae had disappeared. This suggests that potential purchasers of this amplifier should not audition it until it has warmed up.  amplifier, using Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  , using the 880Ms balanced input. I repeated some of the tests using the unbalanced input with a shorting plug connecting pins 1 and 3 of the 880Ms XLR jack.The voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same for the balanced and unbalanced inputs, at 31.5dB, which is about 4dB higher than the norm. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was 23k ohms for both sets of jacks, dropping inconsequentially to 18k ohms at 20kHz. The output impedance   was slightly higher than usual for a solid-state design, at 0.125 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.132 ohm at 20kHz. Nevertheless, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms Law interaction between this output impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.1dB  .Fig.1 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .The frequency response was flat in the audioband, but with a slight rolloff evident starting just below 20kHz and reaching –3dB at 90kHz. A 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with short risetimes  , and a 1kHz squarewave had superbly sharp corners  .Fig.2 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted, was 81.8dB, due mainly to some low-level, odd-order harmonics of the AC supply frequency  . Switching in an A-weighting filter improved the ratio to a good 91.4dB.Fig.4 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Moon Evolution 880M comfortably exceeded its specified maximum power of 800W/29dBW into 8 ohms, clipping   at 1050W  . The AC wall voltage had dropped from 123V with the amplifier idling to 120V with it clipping. However, the 10A fuse on the rear panel blew at the same 1050W into 4 ohms  . Clearly, the 880M is not comfortable driving sustained high powers into low impedances with sinewaves—with its much higher crest factor, music will be less demanding than sinewaves, of course—so I didnt test its maximum output into 2 ohms.Fig.5 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The rising shape of the traces below a few tens of watts in  s. 5 and 6 suggests that the measured THD+N percentage is dominated by noise at low powers. I therefore measured how the THD+N varied with frequency at a level, 12.65V, equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms and 40W into 4 ohms; that way, I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion. The result is shown in  .7. The THD rises above 1kHz into both 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , presumably due to the circuits open-loop bandwidth being insufficient to apply the same amount of corrective negative feedback at high frequencies as at low frequencies. Unusually, the midband distortion is actually lower into 4 ohms than into 8 ohms. When I tried plotting the THD against frequency into 2 ohms at 12.65V, the rear-panel fuse again blew. As that was the last of my spare 10A fuses, I replaced it with an 8A fuse and continued testing. Fortunately, no more fuses were blown!Fig.7 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Once the 880M is fully warmed up, its distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  , followed by the second  . However, some higher-order harmonics are visible in  .9, albeit at or below –110dB  . Intermodulation distortion was also low, even at high powers  .Fig.8 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, 1kHz waveform at 35W into 4 ohms, 0.0031% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 300W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Simaudio Moon Evolution 880M, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 300W peak into 8 ohms  .Simaudios Moon Evolution 880M is a powerhouse of an amplifier, though its ability to drive low impedances does rely on the fact that music has considerably wider dynamic range than do test tones. And it should never be listened to cold.           ',\n",
       " 'Because of the Boulder 2150s bulk and weight—319 lbs in its shipping crate—I wouldnt have been able to get it down the stairs to my test lab, much less back up those stairs. So I packed up my   system   and the PC I use to control it, along with analog and digital oscilloscopes, test loads, and all the cables I would need, and drove to Michael Fremers lair, in deepest, darkest New Jersey.There, I had a couple of problems. Usually, before doing any testing of a power amplifier, I precondition it by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour.   However, one-third of the Boulders specified maximum power of 1000W is 333W, and I dont have a test load that could handle that power level for an hour without overheating. Therefore, I wasnt able to precondition the 2150 before testing it.My second problem, too, was related to the 2150s power. The only practical place to perform the measurements was in Mikeys garage, which adjoins his house. However, the only electrical outlets within reach of the long extension cords Id brought with me were on a 15A circuit.   While this allowed me to test the amplifiers distortion and clipping power into 8 and 4 ohms, the circuit breaker tripped at powers above 800W into 2 ohms, which is well below the specified maximum power of 4000W into this load.The Boulder 2150s voltage gain into 8 ohms was 25.9dB: a little below the norm, but conforming to the specified 26dB. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  , with pin 2 of the XLR jack wired as hot.   The input impedance at 20Hz and 1kHz was 194k ohms, which is close to the specified 200k ohms, and at 20kHz dropped inconsequentially to 130k ohms. The output impedance, including 6 of speaker cable, was extremely low, at 0.02 ohm at low and middle frequencies; this rose only slightly, to 0.026 ohm, at the top of the audioband. As a result, the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was virtually nonexistent. The frequency response into resistive loads was flat in the audioband, and down by just over 3dB at 200kHz  . The Boulders reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured short risetimes, and was free from any overshoot or ringing  .Fig.1 Boulder 2150, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Boulder 2150, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The 2150 was extremely quiet—its unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio with the input shorted to ground measured 78.5dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms. This improved to 94.3dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 97dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the Boulders noise floor while it reproduced a 1kHz tone into 8 ohms   indicated that the only power-supply–related spuriae were all very low in level, and primarily comprised the 60Hz AC frequency and its third and fifth harmonics, all of which were close to or below –110dB  . This spectrum was not affected when I experimented with the grounding between the Boulder and the test system.Fig.3 Boulder 2150, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Not only was the Boulder 2150 quiet, it offered very low distortion and very high power. Fig.4 plots the percentage of THD+noise against output power into 8 ohms. The downward slope of the trace below 200W or so indicates that whatever distortion is present lies below the noise. The 2150 clips sharply, reaching 1% THD+N at 960W  . This is 0.2dB lower than the specified 1000W  , but this is most likely due to the fact that I didnt hold the wall voltage constant during this test. Fig.5 is a similar graph for 4 ohms: The 2150 clips at 1450W into this load  , but again, note that I didnt hold the wall voltage constant.Fig.4 Boulder 2150, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Boulder 2150, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Not only was the Boulders distortion very low; into 8 ohms, it hardly changed with frequency, even at 40V  . There was a rise at higher frequencies at this same level into 4 ohms  , but to no higher than 0.004%. And at 1kHz at 40V into 4 ohms, the distortion waveform was mainly noise, with the faintest hint of third harmonic  . Spectral analysis   indicates that the third harmonic at this level lies at –119dB  , which is about the same level as the third harmonic of the AC supply frequency. Intermodulation distortion is also extraordinarily low  .Fig.6 Boulder 2150, THD+N   vs frequency at 40V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Boulder 2150, 1kHz waveform at 400W into 4 ohms, 0.00036% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Boulder 2150, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–20kHz, at 400W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Boulder 2150, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 8 ohms  .Boulders 2150 is an extraordinary amplifier. It measured so well that it taxed the capabilities of my    . Footnote 1: The SYS2722 has been superseded by the higher-performance APx555, but its going to be a while before I can afford to buy one.           ',\n",

At the end of that time, the temperature of the heatsinks was 113.6°F/45.4°C and that of the top panel 105.3°F/40.8°C. The bias was set at High for all testing.The Gryphon Apex Stereo has only balanced inputs. The voltage gain at 1kHz was 30.85dB into 8 ohms, very close to the specified gain of 31dB. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting. The input impedance is specified as 20k ohms. I measured 19.9k ohms at low and middle frequencies, decreasing inconsequentially to 19.5k ohms at the top of the audioband.Gryphon specifies the Apexs output impedance as 0.015 ohms. My measurement was slightly higher in the right channel, at close to 0.05 ohms  , and significantly higher in the left channel, at 0.17 ohms. I checked the wiring and connections and found nothing amiss. I am at a loss, therefore, to explain this discrepancy. The variation in the small-signal frequency response of the Apexs right channel into our standard simulated loudspeaker   was inconsequential. Into resistive loads  , the amplifier gently rolled off well above the audioband, with the –3dB frequency dependent on the load and channel. The left channels response into 2 ohms   was down by 3dB at 130kHz. The Apexs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Gryphon Apex, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Gryphon Apex, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.As expected from its dual-mono construction, the Apexs channel separation   was superb, at >100dB in both directions below 2kHz and still 80dB at the top of the audioband. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   was very good, measuring 73.4dB  . This ratio improved to an excellent 85dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 90.6dB, left, and 94.1dB, right, when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Gryphon Apex Stereo drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms   revealed that although some AC-related spuriae were present, these all lay at or below –100dB in the left channel   and –110dB in the right channel  . The Apex has individual AC power cords for its two channels. To avoid a ground loop, I plugged my test equipment into the same wall outlet as the left channel. However, I dont believe this was the reason for the higher level of noise and spuriae in the left channel, as the spectrum was the same whether I grounded the XLR inputs pin 1 or left it floating. In any case, though higher than in the left channel, the level is still very low.Fig.3 Gryphon Apex, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Gryphon Apex Stereos maximum continuous power with both channels driven is specified as 210Wpc into 8 ohms  , 420Wpc into 4 ohms  , and 800Wpc into 2 ohms  . The Gryphon amplifier exceeded its specified powers into the higher impedances. With our usual definition of clipping as being when the THD+noise reaches 1%, I measured a clipping power with both channels driven of 240Wpc into 8 ohms   and 450Wpc into 4 ohms  . With one channel driven, the Apex clipped at 750W into 2 ohms  , even though the wall voltage had only dropped slightly at that power, from 120.1V to 119.5V.Fig.4 Gryphon Apex, left channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Gryphon Apex, left channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Gryphon Apex, left channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Figs.4, 5, and 6 were taken from the left channels output. Fig.7 shows how the percentage of THD+noise varies with frequency into 8, 4, and 2 ohms at 20V  . The THD+N was significantly lower in the right channel   than the left  , though still low into the higher impedances.Fig.7 Gryphon Apex, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The left channels distortion signature into 8 ohms predominantly comprised the second and third harmonics  . Spectral analysis at the same power   revealed that while the third harmonic lay at similar levels in both channels, the second harmonic was 16dB higher in the left channel   than the right  , lying at –73dB compared with –89dB. Even with the left channels higher level of harmonic distortion than the right, the Apex still did well driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  . The 1kHz difference product lay 83dB   and 87dB   below the peak signal level, and while the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were a little higher in both channels, they still lay at or below –72dB.Fig.8 Gryphon Apex, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0278% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Gryphon Apex, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Gryphon Apex, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Presumably, the left channels higher levels of distortion and noise and its higher output impedance than the right channels are sample-specific. But even so, the Gryphon Apex Stereo offers high power coupled with a wide bandwidth and primarily low levels of low-order distortion. I wish I could have stayed longer at Mikeys to listen to it driving his Wilson Chronosonic XVX speakers, but I had to beat the rush-hour traffic back to Brooklyn.           ',\n",
       " '  Marantz Model 40n  . For the digital-input measurements, I used TosLink data and the HEOS app on my iPhone to play back test-tone WAV files on a USB stick plugged into the rear-panel port.The Marantzs single-ended line inputs preserved absolute polarity at both the loudspeaker and headphone outputs. The volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps, and the maximum gain was 40.6dB at the loudspeaker outputs and 40.7dB at the headphone output. The power amplifier stage offered a fixed gain of 24dB. The input impedance at both the line inputs and the power amplifier inputs was 15k ohms at all audio frequencies.The Model 40ns output impedance at the headphone output was a relatively high 320 ohms. The loudspeaker output impedance, including the series impedance of 6 of spaced-pair cable, was 0.1 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.12 ohm at 20kHz. The small-signal bandwidth was extremely wide, the response into 8 ohms   down less than 3dB at 200kHz. Into 2 ohms  , the output was –3dB at 100kHz. Frequency-response variations into our simulated loudspeaker load   were negligible. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum  ; the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control. The extended ultrasonic response meant that the Marantzs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured very short risetimes  . Commendably, no overshoot or ringing was visible. The bass and treble controls offered a maximum boost and cut of close to 10dB  .Fig.1 Marantz Model 40n, volume control set to \"100,\" frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms   4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Marantz Model 40n, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Marantz Model 40n, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls turned off and set to maximum and minimum  Channel separation was excellent, at 90dB in both directions below 3kHz and still close to 80dB at 20kHz. With the line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the Model 40ns unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was a good 71.7dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms  . This ratio improved to 82dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 84.7dB when A-weighted. While spuriae at the supply frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics were present in the amplifiers output  , their levels were all very low, even with the volume control set to its maximum.Fig.4 Marantz Model 40n, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms, volume control set to \"100\"  .Marantz specifies the Model 40ns maximum power as 70Wpc into 8 ohms   and 100Wpc into 4 ohms  . We specify clipping power as when the THD+noise reaches 1%. By that measure, and with both channels driven, the Marantz amplifier exceeded its specified powers, clipping at 74Wpc into 8 ohms   and 120Wpc into 4 ohms  . I didnt test clipping power into 2 ohms, as the amplifier isnt specified into that load.  Fig.5 Marantz Model 40n, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Marantz Model 40n, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The distortion lies below the noisefloor at powers below a few tens of watts, so I examined how the THD+N varied with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms  . The distortion is very similar into both 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , and while there is a slight increase in the top two audio octaves, the distortion is extremely low.Fig.7 Marantz Model 40n, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion waveform at this output voltage was dominated by random noise, even when I averaged 32 readings  . Spectral analysis   indicated that the second harmonic was the highest in level into 8 ohms, but at –103dB  , this is negligible. At the same voltage into 4 ohms  , the third harmonic was now the highest in level but at close to –100dB   is still negligible. Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W peak into 4 ohms, the intermodulation distortion products all lay at or below –90dB  .Fig.8 Marantz Model 40n, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0066% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Marantz Model 40n, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Marantz Model 40n, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Marantz Model 40n, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the Marantz Model 40ns digital-input performance, the optical and coaxial S/PDIF inputs locked to data sampled at up to 192kHz. The Marantzs digital inputs all preserved absolute polarity. With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at –40dBFS resulted in a level at both the loudspeaker and headphone outputs of 2.2V. This implies that the D/A circuit has close to 20dB of excess gain. Data at 0dBFS would drive the amplifier into clipping unless the volume control was set to –20dB  . I used this volume control setting for the digital input measurements, and to avoid damaging the power amplifier stage with high-level digital data,  digital inputs behavior at the headphone output, which mutes the loudspeaker outputs.The Marantz amplifier offers a choice of two reconstruction filters, referred to as F1 and F2. F1s impulse response with 44.1kHz data   is typical of a very short linear-phase filter, with just one cycle of ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. F2s impulse response   has ringing on both sides of the single high sample, but with considerably more ringing after than before. This impulse response is identical to the \"hybrid\" filter offered by ESS DAC chips  . With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the F1 filters response rolled off slowly above 20kHz, not reaching full stop-band suppression until 37kHz, well above half the sample rate  . The aliased image at 25kHz of a 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS   is suppressed by just 12dB, therefore, but the distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are all very low in level. Repeating this analysis with the F2 filter  , the ultrasonic rolloff was much faster, resulting in considerably greater suppression of the aliased image at 25kHz. However, there is an odd boost in the noisefloor above 65kHz.Fig.12 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, F1 filter, impulse response  .Fig.13 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, F2 filter, impulse response  .Fig.14 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, F1 filter, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.15 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, F2 filter, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .With F1 active and 44.1kHz data  , the digital-input frequency response rolled off gently above 12kHz, reaching –3dB at 20kHz. The levels of the two channels were perfectly matched. With 96kHz   and 192kHz   data, the audioband output was flat, with then a gentle rolloff starting below half of each sample rate. With the F2 filter  , the audioband response was flat, with then a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate.Fig.16 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, F1 filter, volume control set to –20dB, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.17 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, F2 filter, volume control set to –20dB, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .  resolution of the Model 40ns digital inputs by looking at the spectrum at the headphone output with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16- and 24-bit data  . The noisefloor dropped by 15dB with 24-bit data, which implies that the Marantz offers between 18 and 19 bits of resolution. However, this graph was taken with the volume control set to –20dB.   ultimate resolution, I repeated the 24-bit analysis with the volume control set to its maximum. The noisefloor dropped by another 6dB, but the improved resolution will be academic given the digital inputs gain architecture. The waveform of a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS with undithered 16-bit data was reproduced with the three DC voltage levels described by the data unobscured by noise  . With undithered 24-bit data  , the result was a relatively clean sinewave.Fig.18 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, volume control set to –20dB, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.19 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Intermodulation distortion via the Marantz amplifiers digital inputs with F1 active   was very low in both channels. While the ultrasonic aliased images of the tones are suppressed by just 10–12dB, the higher-order audioband images all lie close to –120dB. With F2, the difference product at 1kHz lay at just –114dB  .Fig.20 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, Filter 1, volume control set to –20dB, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.21 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, Filter 1, volume control set to –20dB, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .  Model 40n for its rejection of word-clock jitter via its TosLink input using 16- and 24-bit J-Test data sampled at 44.1kHz. Other than those closest to the frequency of the tone at one-quarter the sample rate, the odd-order harmonics of the 16-bit J-Test signals LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were all close to the correct levels  . However, some broadening of the noisefloor around Fs/4 spectral component can be seen, most likely due to jitter with a low-frequency, random noise spectrum. This broadening was also evident with 24-bit J-Test noisefloor data  .Fig.22 Marantz Model 40n, TosLink input, volume control set to –20dB, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.To look at the Marantzs moving magnet phono input, I connected a separate ground wire from the terminal on the amplifiers chassis to the ground of the Audio Precision analyzer.  phono inputs behavior primarily at the headphone output, again to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stages with high-level signals.The phono input preserved absolute polarity. The maximum gain, with the volume control set to its maximum, was 84.8dB at both the headphone output and loudspeaker outputs, so the gain of the phono section is 44.2dB. This gain value means that clipping is possible with high-level LP signals; owners should make sure the volume control isnt set near the maximum when using the phono input. I performed most of the phono-input tests with the control set to –20dB.  The M40ns phono input impedance was 39k ohms at 20Hz, 46k ohms at 1kHz, and 40k ohms at 20kHz, values appropriate for moving magnet cartridges. The RIAA correction   was well-matched between the channels but featured a broad rise in the midrange that reached +0.45dB at 150Hz. The phono inputs unweighted, wideband S/N ratio, measured with the input shorted to ground, was a very good 69.7dB   referred to an input signal of 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased the ratio to an excellent 83dB, while switching an A-weighting filter into circuit further increased the ratio to 87.7dB.Fig.23 Marantz Model 40n, phono input, response with RIAA correction   and with subsonic filter    .The Marantz phono inputs overload margins were commendably high from 20Hz to 20kHz, at 24.4dB ref. 1kHz at 5mV. The phono stages distortion was very low, with all the second and third harmonics lying close to –100dB  , even with a 1kHz tone 16dB higher than the nominal MM output level of 5mV. High-order intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones, at a peak input level equivalent to 1kHz at 30mV, lay below –100dB  , with the second-order difference product at 1kHz lying at –94dB  .Fig.24 Marantz Model 40n, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 30mV input  .The Marantz Model 40n offers uniformly excellent measured performance from all its inputs. But I remain puzzled why its digital inputs, in common with almost all integrated amplifiers I have tested, offer considerably higher gain than necessary.

       " '  Pass Labs XA30.5s measured behavior with Stereophiles loaner sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. s on an amplifier, I run it for 60 minutes at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms, which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. Superficially, the XA30.5 appears to be a 30Wpc class-A design. But this is not the maximum output power. The specifications list the amplifiers maximum output voltage as ±35V, which, assuming this is the RMS voltage, is equivalent to 153W into 8 ohms. The XA30.5 thus transitions into class-B for the top 6dB of its dynamic-range capability. I therefore preconditioned the Pass amplifier by running it at 40Wpc into 8 ohms for an hour. The heatsinks were just over 60°C   at the end of that period; the distortion had dropped slightly, from 0.0192% to 0.0176%.The XA30.5s voltage gain into 8 ohms was 26.65dB from both balanced and unbalanced inputs, and both sets of inputs reserved absolute polarity; ie, were non-inverting.   The input impedance of the balanced XLR jacks was 29k ohms, close to the specified 30k ohms; the input impedance of the single-ended RCA jacks was higher than specified, at 20k ohms. Both  ures were constant across the audioband.The output impedance was low, at 0.08 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising inconsequentially to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the usual Ohms Law interaction between its source impedance and the modulus of the loudspeakers impedance remained within ±0.01dB limits  . This graph also reveals excellent channel matching, as well as a wide small-signal bandwidth—the –3dB point lies at around 125kHz. The XA30.5s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was consequently superbly square  , with short risetimes and no hint of overshoot or ringing. The 1kHz squarewave   was similarly well formed.Fig.1 Pass Labs XA30.5, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Pass Labs XA30.5, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Pass Labs XA30.5, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was superb, at better than 110dB below 5kHz, and still 98dB   and 104dB   at 20kHz. The audioband unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms, was an excellent 83.6dB, increasing to 87.2dB when A-weighted.Fig.4 shows how the THD+noise percentage in the amplifiers output varies with output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. While the XA30.5 may give 30Wpc into 8 ohms in class-A  , the distortion at this power level is low, at 0.015%. The amplifier doesnt actually clip   until a much higher power level: 130Wpc into 8 ohms  . Even higher powers were available into lower impedances before clipping: 195Wpc into 4 ohms with both channels driven  , and 332W into 2 ohms with one channel driven  . The shapes of the traces in  .4 indicate that the distortion starts to rise out of the noise floor at output powers above a few watts, with then a gentle increase until the waveform starts to square off. I therefore examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a level of 10.5V, equivalent to 13.8W into 8 ohms. The results are shown in  .5. While the distortion is very low in the low and middle frequencies, it does start to rise with increasing frequency above 500Hz, and is worse into 2 ohms   than into higher impedances.Fig.4 Pass Labs XA30.5, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.5 Pass Labs XA30.5, THD+N   vs frequency at 10.5V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .What matters more than the absolute level of an amplifiers distortion is its spectral composition. Fig.6 reveals that the XA30.5s THD is almost pure third harmonic, even at a level where the amplifiers output stage is no longer running in pure class-A. And as youd expect from the rich bias level, there is no hint of crossover distortion. FFT analysis indicates that while there is some second harmonic present as well as the third, it lies about 100dB down from the fundamental level  , and all higher-order harmonics are very low in level. The presence of sidebands at ±120Hz around the fundamental and third harmonic, however, suggests that the amplifier is working hard. Still, all power-supply–related spectral components are at or below –108dB, which is negligible.Fig.6 Pass Labs XA30.5, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms  , 0.023% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Pass Labs XA30.5, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 37W into 8 ohms  .Finally, the XA30.5s decreasing linearity in the top octaves led to a somewhat disappointing result on the high-power, high-frequency intermodulation test, particularly with the right channel  .   While the second-order difference component from the 19+20kHz test signal was respectably low, at –103dB left channel   and –94dB right  , higher-order products also made an appearance, with the 18 and 21kHz tones reaching –60dB  . This is very much a worst-case test, however.Fig.8 Pass Labs XA30.5, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 75W peak into 8 ohms  .Pass Labs XA30.5 is a Jekyll-and-Hyde amplifier. Ostensibly a 30Wpc class-A design, its measured performance reveals that it can actually deliver clipping-free peaks 6dB higher in power, while the fact that its distortion under those conditions is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic is commendable.

       " '  Bryston B1353    . The review sample was not fitted with the optional phono and digital input modules. Before I performed the testing,   amplifier by running it at one-eighth its specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes, as recommended by the CEA. After preconditioning, the heatsinks on the amplifiers sides were too hot to touch, at 148.5°F  . The top panel was also hot, at 106.4°F  . This amplifier needs plenty of ventilation.The voltage gain at the loudspeaker outputs loaded with 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum was 41.1dB, typical of a solid-state integrated amplifier. The maximum gain at the preamplifier outputs was 12.1dB, and at the headphone outputs it was 27.6dB. The power amplifier section can be driven independently; it offered a gain of 29.1dB into 8 ohms. All the inputs and outputs preserved absolute polarity, ie, were noninverting.The input impedance at 20Hz and 1kHz was higher than the specified 30k ohms, at 47k ohms, dropping inconsequentially to 42k ohms at 20kHz. The input impedance for the power amplifier section was 30k ohms across the audioband. The output impedance at both the preamplifier and headphone outputs was 71 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. The output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals   was very low, at 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.15 ohm at 20kHz. The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker therefore varied by just ±0.1dB  . The response into 8 ohms   reached –3dB at 65kHz, though the response at the preamplifier and headphone outputs was not down by 3dB until 190kHz  . These graphs were taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control. The B1353s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured short risetimes with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Bryston B1353, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.1 Bryston B1353, headphone output, frequency response at 1V into 300 ohms    .Fig.3 Bryston B1353, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was 75dB in both directions below 5kHz, dropping to 67dB at the top of the audioband. Measured with the single-ended inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the Brystons wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio was 66.5dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms in both channels. This ratio improved to 71.7dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 74.4dB when the reading was A-weighted. The magenta and red traces in  .4, taken at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum, reveal spuriae at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics. Reducing the volume control by 20dB and increasing the input voltage to give the same 1Wpc into 8 ohms   reduces the level of these spuriae by 20dB, which suggests they may be due to the preamplifier circuitry picking up magnetic interference from the power transformer.Fig.4 Bryston B1353, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to maximum   and set to –20dB    .Repeating the spectral analysis with the power amplifier section driven directly   indicated that the primary spurious tone was 60Hz at –80dB  . The signal/ noise ratio with this input shorted to ground   was 77dB  , 86.6dB  , and 89.3dB  . This supports my supposition that the higher level of noise with the volume control set to its maximum is due to the B1353s preamplifier section.Fig.5 Bryston B1353, power amplifier input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms    .I examined how the percentage of THD+N varied with output power; clipping was defined as when the THD+noise in the amplifiers output reached 1%. With both channels driven into 8 ohms, the B1353 exceeded its specified maximum power of 135W  , clipping at 155Wpc  . The clipping power into 4 ohms, again with both channels driven, was 230Wpc  . With both channels driven, the Bryston clipped at 165Wpc into 2 ohms  . The downward slope of the traces in  s.6 and 7 indicates that actual distortion decreases beneath the noisefloor at powers below clipping.   I examined how the THD+N percentage varied with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms. The results are shown in  .8: The distortion and noise remain very low over most of the audioband, with only small rises in the top and bottom octaves, particularly in the right channel  .Fig.6 Bryston B1353, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Bryston B1353, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Bryston B1353, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The waveform of the THD+N at 50Wpc into 8 ohms after the 1kHz fundamental had been notched out   suggests that the third harmonic is the highest in level; it is overlaid with analog noise. However, when  spectrum of the Brystons output as it drove 50Hz at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  , the second harmonic lay at –106dB  , which was a little higher than the third harmonic in the left channel  . If higher-order harmonics are present, they are obscured by the power supply–related spuriae.   Repeating the spectral analysis using the power amplifier inputs   confirmed that the second harmonic was the highest in level and that the third harmonic was a little higher in the right channel than the left, at –108dB vs –119dB. All the values are very low.Fig.9 Bryston B1353, 1kHz waveform at 50Wpc into 8 ohms, 0.0044% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Bryston B1353, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Bryston B1353, power amplifier input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 shows the spectrum of the B1353s output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 50Wpc.   The second-order difference product at 1kHz and the higher-order intermodulation products all lay close to a negligible –110dB  .Fig.12 Bryston B1353, power amplifier input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .The Bryston B1353 offers extremely low levels of distortion. Background noise will be at its lowest when the volume control is below the maximum.           ',\n",
       " '  LKV PWR-3  . Because the amplifier has a class-D output stage, I inserted an Audio Precision AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter between the test load and the analyzer. This filter mitigates RF noise that would otherwise drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slew-rate limiting. Without the filter, 210mV of ultrasonic noise with a center frequency of 500kHz was present at the amplifiers output terminals. I used the filter for all the tests other than frequency response.Because the PWR-3 is a class-D design, there was no formal need to precondition it before the testing. However, after operating the amplifier at 1/8 the specified power into 8 ohms for 20 minutes, the top panel was slightly warm, its temperature measuring 94.2°F/34.6°C.The LKV PWR-3 preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, and its voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was slightly higher than the specified 26dB, at 26.36dB. The single-ended input impedance is specified as a very high 200k ohms. I measured 290k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, decreasing inconsequentially to a still very high 156k ohms at 20kHz.The PWR-3s output impedance was impressively low, at 0.04 ohms at low and middle frequencies, 0.07 ohms at the top of the audioband.   The variation in the amplifiers small-signal frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker   response was therefore inconsequential. The LKV amplifier rolled off sharply above 30kHz, the –3dB frequency lying close to 60kHz. The PWR-3s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   featured a critically damped overshoot but no ringing.Fig.1 LKV PWR-3, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 LKV PWR-3, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The PWR-3s channel separation   was modest, at 63–70dB in both directions. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   was excellent, at 81dB  . This ratio improved to a superb 95.8dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 99.75dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the LKV amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms   revealed that as well as the very low level of random noise, AC-related spuriae lay at or below –110dB. This is a very quiet amplifier!Fig.3 LKV PWR-3, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .LKV specifies the PWR-3s maximum continuous power   as 175W into 8 ohms  , 360W into 4 ohms  , and 225W into 2 ohms  . With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—and with both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of 172Wpc into 8 ohms   and 305Wpc into 4 ohms  . With one channel driven, the PWR-3 clipped at 500W into 2 ohms  . The increase in THD+N above powers of 1–2W in these graphs suggests that the amplifier uses a limited amount of loop negative feedback.Fig.4 LKV PWR-3, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 LKV PWR-3, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 LKV PWR-3, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Fig.7 shows how the percentage of THD+noise varies with frequency into 8, 4, and 2 ohms at 14.14V  . Commendably, the THD+N percentage was low and didnt increase as the load impedance was reduced.Fig.7 LKV PWR-3, THD+N   vs frequency at 14.14V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The third harmonic was the highest in level  , with the second harmonic about 12dB lower  . Even at the high power into 4 ohms I used to create this graph, the third harmonic lay at a relatively low –60dB, with higher-order odd harmonics all below –96dB. With the PWR-3 driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay at –80dB  . While the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were 10dB higher, that is still relatively low in level.Fig.8 LKV PWR-3, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.09% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 LKV PWR-3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 LKV PWR-3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Not only does LKVs PWR-3 offer high power coupled with very low noise and primarily low-order distortion; its linearity is independent of load impedance. This is unusual and commendable.           ',\n",
       " '  Electrocompaniet AW400, I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain.Electrocompaniet refers to the AW400 as a \"Class A\" amplifier, but the heat signature and the idling power consumption suggests that it uses a conventional class-AB output stage.   Electrocompaniet by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes, a level that maximally stresses a class-B or –AB amplifiers ability to shed waste heat. With the amplifier cold, the THD+noise level was 0.008%; at the end of the preconditioning period, the THD+N had dropped to 0.0035% and the AW400s chassis was warm. The only hot spots were the grilles above the internal heatsinks, but these werent so hot that I couldnt keep my hand on them.The voltage gain with the input trim control at its maximum was a high 34.2dB and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity; ie, was non-inverting.   The input impedance was very high at all frequencies—my estimate was 450k ohms at low and midrange frequencies compared with the specified 330k ohms, but there is always a large error when measuring such high values of input impedance. It did drop to 100k ohms at 20kHz, though this will be inconsequential.The output impedance is specified as being below 0.01 ohm, which is very low. However, including 6 of speaker cable, I measured 0.135 ohm at low and midrange frequencies, rising very slightly to 0.17 ohm at the top of the audioband. This resulted in a mild ±0.1dB variation in the AW400s frequency response when it drove our standard simulated loudspeaker  . The high-frequency rolloff was –3dB at 115kHz into 16 ohms, but was negligible at 20kHz  . It did increase slightly with decreasing load impedance, reaching a still-modest –0.4dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . As a result of this wide bandwidth, the Electrocompaniets reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was nicely square  .Fig.1 Electrocompaniet AW400, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Electrocompaniet AW400, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Even with its high gain, the AW400 was a quiet amplifier. The unweighted audioband signal/noise ratio   was 86.9dB, equivalent to a voltage of just 128µV, compared with the specified 130µV  . Plotting the THD+N percentage against output power   indicates that the distortion lies below this noise at levels up to a few tens of watts into loads of 8 ohms and above. The power at clipping with continuous drive was 425W into 8 ohms   and 655W into 4 ohms  . The amplifiers protection circuit cut in at 525W into 2 ohms  , which is why the top trace in  .3 ends at that point. The amplifier more than met its specified power into 8 ohms but fell a bit short into 4 ohms. This is because I dont hold the wall AC voltage constant during this test. It was 124.5V with the amplifier idling, but had dropped to 122.2V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms.Fig.3 Electrocompaniet AW400, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 16, 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.4 plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at a level   where the distortion is beginning to rise above the noise floor. All the traces start to rise in the top two audio octaves, due to the amplifiers inevitable reduction in open-loop bandwidth in this region, but the rise is mild and the distortion remains low in level. While the AW400 offers low distortion, what distortion there is contains some higher harmonics  . Spectral analysis of the waveform in  .5 indicates that only the second and third harmonics reach –90dB, but the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth lie at or above –100dB, which will most likely be inaudible. At higher levels  , the third harmonic rises to a still-low –84dB   and the higher-order harmonics actually decrease in level. While this graph does indicate that some power-supply harmonics are present, the highest-level component, at the full-wave-rectified frequency of 120Hz, lies at –97dB, or low enough not to matter. I did experiment with grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision test system to reduce the level of the power-supply spuriae; this was the best I could achieve.Fig.4 Electrocompaniet AW400, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.7V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.5 Electrocompaniet AW400, 1kHz waveform at 52W into 4 ohms  , 0.008% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Electrocompaniet AW400, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 201W into 8 ohms  .Finally, even at a level just below visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope screen, the Electrocompaniet AW400 performed relatively well on the demanding high-frequency intermodulation test  . The difference product at 1kHz lay at –94dB, and the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz only just rose above –80dB.Fig.7 Electrocompaniet AW400, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 401W peak into 4 ohms  .The Electrocompaniet AW400 offers high power coupled with low levels of noise and distortion. I am not surprised Art Dudley was impressed by it.           ',\n",
       " '  Boulder 866    , then repeated some tests with the magazines more recently acquired APx555 system. But first,   amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the top panel was very hot, at 115.5°F  , and the heatsinks were too hot to touch, at 133.3°F  . The Boulder amplifiers output stages appear to be biased heavily into partial class-A operation. Owners must make sure the amplifier has sufficient ventilation.  I looked first at the Boulders performance via one of its three balanced line inputs. The specified maximum gain is 40.4dB, though this can be adjusted with the front-panel menu screen. As set up by JVS, the 866s maximum gain at the speaker outputs was 30.75dB. The volume control operated in accurate 1dB steps. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity, and the input XLR jacks were wired with pin 2 positive, the AES standard. The input impedance is specified as 100k ohms; I measured 98k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and an inconsequential drop to 80k ohms at 20kHz.The Boulder amplifiers output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 0.16 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.19 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker load, was a negligible ±0.2dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB at 100kHz, which correlates with the Boulders accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  . The level of the right channel in  .1 was 0.1dB lower than that of the left. Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; neither the frequency response nor the channel matching changed at lower settings of the volume control.Fig.1 Boulder 866, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Boulder 866, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was superb, at >110dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 79dB at the top of the audioband. The Boulders unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the balanced line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was very good, at 78.8dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms  . This ratio improved to 86.4dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 89dB when A-weighted. The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its even- and odd-order harmonics  , with the latter higher in level than the former.   The cyan and magenta traces in this graph were taken with the volume control set to its maximum, the blue and red traces with it set to \"80,\" which is equivalent to –20dB. The lower setting reduced the levels of both the random noisefloor components and the supply-related spuriae by around 10dB, but even at the maximum setting the noise is low in level.Fig.3 Boulder 866, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, volume control set to maximum   and to –20dB  .With both channels driven, the 866 slightly exceeded its specified maximum power into 8 ohms of 200Wpc  , clipping at 1% THD+noise at 210Wpc  . The Boulder didnt meet its specified maximum power of 400Wpc into 4 ohms  , clipping at 360Wpc  . However, according to the manual, Boulders specified maximum powers were taken with an AC wall voltage of 120V. On the day   amplifier, my wall voltage was 116V—I suspect that everyone on my street had their wall air conditioners operating—dropping to 114.5V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms. Boulder doesnt specify a maximum continuous power into 2 ohms, but with one channel driven the amplifier clipped at 650W into 2 ohms  . The rear-panel 8A circuit breaker operated just above this power when I performed this test. Muting the 866 and pushing back the breaker button restored the amplifier to normal operation.Fig.4 Boulder 866, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Boulder 866, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Boulder 866, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The downward slope of the traces below the actual clipping power in  s.4 and 5 is due to the actual distortion lying beneath the noisefloor.   I therefore examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 14.17V, which is equivalent to 25W into 8 ohms, 50W into 4 ohms, and 100W into 2 ohms. The left channels distortion was very low in the bass and midrange into both 8 and 4 ohms  , and though it rose in the top octaves, it was still below 0.02%. The right channel had slightly more distortion into 8 ohms   and a lot more into 4 ohms  . I have only shown the left channels distortion into 2 ohms  , as the rear-panel circuit breaker operated while I was measuring how the right channels THD+N varied with frequency into this load.Fig.7 Boulder 866, THD+N   vs frequency at 14.17V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The distortion was predominantly the subjectively benign third harmonic  , though it was higher in the right channel   than the left  . Some higher-order harmonics are present in both channels, but these are very low in level. A low level of second harmonic distortion is present in the right channel, which suggests that in this channel the complementary output devices are not optimally matched.   When the 866 drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50W peak into 8 ohms, all the intermodulation products lay at or below –100dB   in both channels  .Fig.8 Boulder 866, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0024% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Boulder 866, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Boulder 866, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .  Boulder 866s D/A performance primarily using its AES/EBU input, repeating some tests with the TosLink S/PDIF input and with the amplifier connected to my network and sent audio data by Roon. The Boulder 866s optical input locked to data sampled up to 96kHz, the AES/EBU input up to 192kHz.With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in a level at the loudspeaker outputs of 18.5V, which is 6.9dB below the clipping voltage and equivalent to 42.8W into 8 ohms. It appears, therefore, that the Boulders digital inputs have around 14dB of excess gain. To avoid damaging the Boulders power amplifier with high- level digital signals, I performed all the measurements of the digital inputs performance with the volume control set to –20dB.The Boulders digital inputs all pre- served absolute polarity. The impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With white noise sampled at 44.1kHz  , the 866s rsponse rolled off sharply above 20kHz, though it didnt reach full stop-band suppression until 57kHz. The steep rolloff slope became shallower just above half the sample rate  . An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   is barely visible above the noisefloor, though the distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone can be seen, including the second, which was not present with the analog inputs.Fig.11 Boulder 866, digital inputs, impulse response  .Fig.12 Boulder 866, digital inputs, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .The 866s digital-input frequency response was flat in the audioband and follows the same basic shape, with a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate  . The levels of the two channels were perfectly matched. When I increased the bit depth from 6 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noisefloor components dropped by around 14dB, which implies that the 866 offers close to 18 bits of resolution. However, the noisefloor contains a large number of low-level, power-supply–related spuriae, particularly in the left channel  . Pairs of low-frequency sidebands are visible around each of the harmonic frequencies. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved. With undithered 24-bit data  , the result was a relatively clean sinewave.Fig.13 Boulder 866, digital inputs, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.14 Boulder 866, digital inputs, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.15 Boulder 866, digital inputs, waveform of undithered 16-bit, 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS  .Fig.16 Boulder 866, digital inputs, waveform of undithered 24-bit, 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS  .Intermodulation distortion via the Boulder amplifiers digital inputs   was a little higher than it had been with analog input signals, the difference product at 1kHz lying at –89dB   compared with –101dB  .  866 for its rejection of word-clock jitter via its TosLink, AES/ EBU, and network inputs. Though all the odd-order harmonics of the 16-bit J-Test signals LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were at the correct levels  , the spectral spike that represents the high-level tone at exactly one-quarter the sample rate was surrounded by power supply– related sidebands. All three digital inputs behaved identically in this respect. The same supply-related sidebands were present with 24-bit J-Test data  .Fig.17 Boulder 866, digital inputs, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.I investigated whether the sidebands were due to jitter or to supply noise on the DAC chips voltage reference pin by performing narrow- band spectral analyses with 24-bit data representing full-scale tones at 5, 10, 15, and 20kHz. If the sidebands were due to supply noise, the levels of the sidebands would remain the same at all four signal frequencies. If they were due to jitter, their levels would drop as the frequency of the signal reduced. The levels of the sidebands were the same with all the signal frequencies, so they must be due to supply-related spuriae.The Boulder products that I have measured in the past have all demonstrated excellent audio engineering. With the exception of the higher harmonic distortion in the right channel, which may well have been due to an out-of-specification output device, the 866 performed well on the test bench. It offers relatively high power with very low harmonic and intermodulation distortion. The digital inputs generally performed well, though I was a little bothered by the presence of power supply–related spuriae in  s.13 and 15. I must assume that these are due to the sensitive digital circuitry sharing space in a relatively small enclosure with a massive power transformer.           ',\n",
       " 'The ASR Emitter II Exclusives battery power supply was fully charged when I began my testing. After Id preconditioned the amplifier with both channels running for an hour at one-third maximum power into 8 ohms, the heatsinks were only just too hot to touch  , and the THD+noise percentage was 0.0164%—not significantly different from the  ure of 0.0137% with the amplifier cold. The voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to \"61,\" the normal highest level in \"Energy Saving Mode\", was 27.2dB. Setting the volume control to its maximum of \"76\" in full-power mode resulted in a voltage gain of 41.9dB. This was for singled-ended drive. For balanced drive, the maximum gain was 6dB lower, due to the use of the balanced/unbalanced conversion circuitry. The ASR was noninverting through all of its inputs, and its unbalanced input impedance was 10k ohms at all frequencies, including via the Direkt jack.The ASRs output impedance was very low: <0.08 ohm across the audioband  . As a result, the modification of the Emitter IIs frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between this impedance and that of the speaker was also very low  . Fig.1 also reveals that the ASR has a very wide small-signal bandwidth—the –3dB point lies at almost 200kHz—though this decreases into lower impedances. Also shown is a residual peak at around 130kHz, perhaps an indication of a parasitic resonance somewhere in the circuit, which adds a very small overshoot to the shape of a 10kHz squarewave  . Channel separation   was good rather than great, at 70dB at 1kHz.Fig.1 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.2 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Emitter IIs unweighted, wideband S/N Ratio, taken with the volume control at \"76\" but with the input shorted, was 78.2dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. Reducing the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz improved the  ure to 89.9dB, while A-weighting improved it further, to 92.4dB.Testing the Emitter II Exclusives power-delivery at clipping was an exercise in frustration, as the amplifiers protection circuitry would turn the amplifier off before it actually clipped, and flash a red warning light on the front panel. The protection circuitry had to be reset by turning the amplifier fully off. There also appeared to be some kind of \"history\" effect, in that once the amplifier had shut itself off, it would not allow as much power to be delivered to the test load the next time I tried to clip it. So bear all of that in mind when you look at the traces in  .3, which plots the ASRs THD+N percentage against output power into loads ranging from 8 ohms down to 2 ohms. The bottom trace was taken with both channels driven into 8 ohms; it stops at 285W  , which is where the amplifier shut down, not where it clipped. Subsequently tested with both channels driven into 4 ohms  , the ASR shut off at 128W. But with one channel driven into 2 ohms  , the Emitter II didnt shut itself off until it was putting out 830W  .Fig.3 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.The shape of the traces in  .3 suggests that the Emitter IIs distortion lies under the noise below output powers of 10W or so. I therefore examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 11.5V output, equivalent to 16.5W into 8 ohms. The results are shown in  .4, which shows that while the THD is very low at low and midrange frequencies, it does rise with both increasing frequency and decreasing load impedance, though not to any level that might be thought to be subjectively significant.Fig.4 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, THD+N   vs frequency at 11.5V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.5 suggests that the distortions harmonic content is predominantly low-order, although a peculiar discontinuity in the distortion waveform at the start of each sinewave cycle is more pronounced into low than into high impedances. This is examined somewhat differently in  s.6 and 7, which show the spectra of the ASRs output while it drives a 50Hz tone at high levels into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. The difference made by doubling the output current at low frequencies appears mainly to be the introduction of third-harmonic distortion to accompany the second harmonic, though the levels of both harmonics are still very low, at –86dB  . But at higher frequencies at high powers, the fifth, seventh, and ninth harmonics all make more of an appearance  .Fig.5 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, 1kHz waveform at 32.5W into 4 ohms  , 0.0078% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 112W into 8 ohms  .Fig.7 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 225W into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 225W into 4 ohms  .Intermodulation distortion was very low, even at very high powers into 4 ohms  . This graph, incidentally, was taken with one channel driven about an hour after the THD-vs-power curves were taken. You can see that the Emitter IIs protection circuitry had now allowed me to drive the amplifier at a higher level into 4 ohms than it had before  .Fig.9 ASR Emitter II Exclusive, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 555W peak into 4 ohms  .With its three separate power supplies and its tethered power cables, the ASR Emitter II Exclusive was awkward to set up in my test lab. But its measured performance is, overall, beyond reproach, and when I auditioned it in Michael Fremers system prior to taking it home with me, the sound of his big Wilson speakers had an ease and a dynamic sweep that I had not experienced before from his system. This unusual amplifier is definitely a high-end contender!           ',\n",
       " '  Constellation Performance Centaur II 500    .  , I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time, the Constellations enclosure was hottest toward the rear of the top panel, at 101.3°F  .The voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 25.9dB for both balanced and unbalanced signals, and 12dB for the Direct input. All sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The unbalanced input impedance was 10k ohms and the balanced input impedance 20k ohms, both from 20Hz to 20kHz. These impedances are significantly lower than the specified 100k ohms unbalanced and 200k ohms balanced, but are identical to those published for the original Centaur II amplifier.The output impedance, including a 6, spaced-pair speaker cable, was a very low 0.08 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.1 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the modulation of the Constellations frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was less than ±0.1dB  . The Centaur II 500s frequency response into 8 ohms was down by just 0.5dB at 200kHz  ; as a result, a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with very short risetimes  , and there was no overshoot or ringing. Fig.1 reveals that the ultrasonic output rolls off a little earlier with lower impedances, but the response into 2 ohms   is still flat within the audioband.Fig.1 Constellation Centaur II 500, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Constellation Centaur II 500, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was >90dB in both directions in the midrange and below, and still 83dB at the top of the audioband. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the inputs shorted to ground, was a high 74.1dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to an excellent 85dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 89dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor   indicated that the AC power-supply–related harmonics were primarily at 120Hz and its harmonics, but some odd-order harmonics of the 60Hz line frequency were present in the right channel  . All of these spuriae lay at or below –90dB  , however.Fig.3 Constellation Centaur II 500, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Centaur II 500 is specified as outputting 500Wpc into 8 ohms  , 1000Wpc into 4 ohms  , or 1600Wpc into 2 ohms  . With clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1%, I measured clipping powers of 550Wpc into 8 ohms   and 880Wpc into 4 ohms  . While this latter power is less than specified, note that I do not hold the wall voltage constant during these tests. The 0.6dB measured shortfall into 4 ohms will not be any kind of problem. However, when I tried to measure the maximum output power into 2 ohms with one channel driven, that channel turned off at 700W   and wouldnt turn back on. Each channel is protected by two 10A and two 30A fuses, and it turned out that one of the 10A fuses had blown. Replacing the fuse brought that channel back to life.Fig.4 Constellation Centaur II 500, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Constellation Centaur II 500, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.To be certain that I was measuring actual distortion, I examined how the M15s percentage of THD+N varied with frequency at a fairly high level: 20V  . The percentage of THD+N was extremely low in the bass and midrange  , and while there was the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in open-loop voltage gain as the frequency increases, this was still not to a significant amount.Fig.6 Constellation Centaur II 500, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The THD+N waveform at this level into 8 ohms   indicates that the distortion is predominantly third-harmonic in nature, at –80dB  , though there was also some second harmonic present in the left channel  . At the same voltage into 4 ohms  , the third harmonic dropped and the second harmonic became the highest in level in both channels, and was almost matched by the fifth harmonic at –94dB  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, the Constellation produced low levels of intermodulation distortion, even at high powers into low impedances  , with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –86dB  , and the higher-order products at or below –84dB  .Fig.7 Constellation Centaur II 500, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0012% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Constellation Centaur II 500, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 80W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Constellation Centaur II 500, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 160W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Constellation Centaur II 500, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 160W peak into 4 ohms  .Its measured performance indicates that Constellations Centaur II 500 is a powerhouse of an amplifier.

       " '  Masters Series M32 DirectDigital    . Usually, before I test an amplifier, I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. This thermally stresses an amplifier with a conventional class-AB output stage, but as the NAD is a class-D design, this wasnt appropriate. Even so, before doing any testing I ran it for an hour at a moderate power level, to ensure that it was fully warmed up. Because class-D amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slew-rate limiting, all   with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz.Looking first at the analog inputs: With the NADs volume control set to its recommended maximum of \"0.0dB,\" the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 26.1dB from the speaker terminals, an input of 140mV producing an output of 1W into 8 ohms. The headphone output offered an insertion loss of 0.2dB: 1kHz at 1V was reproduced as 975mV. Increasing the volume setting to \"+10dB\" increased the gain by exactly 10dB. The line inputs preserved absolute polarity  , and the input impedance was 10k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly to 9.4k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone output impedance was a very low 1 ohm. With the M32s output optimized for 4 ohm loads, the output impedance at the speaker terminals was 0.17 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, but was slightly negative at 20kHz, presumably due to the behavior of the necessary low-pass filter. The action of this filter can be seen in  .1, where a peak that develops at the top of the audioband increases into higher load impedances. The output is flat into 4 ohms  , and starts to droop into 2 ohms  . The peak is highest with our standard simulated loudspeaker  . Optimizing the M32 for other impedances—as well as 4 ohms, the other settings are 2, 8, and >8 ohms—flattened the top-octave response for the selected load, but increased the height of the peak when the actual load impedance was higher than the nominal setting  .Fig.1 NAD M32, analog input, 4 ohms setting, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 NAD M32, analog input, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with 2 ohms setting  , 4 ohms setting  , 8 ohms setting  , >8 ohms setting    .I was puzzled by the overall shape of the traces in  .1, which cut off sharply above 20kHz. But when I looked at the M32s reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave  , I remembered that the amplifier digitizes its analog inputs and that Id set the converters sample rate to its lowest setting, 48kHz. The analog line inputs can also be digitized at 96 or 192kHz. Fig.4 shows the M32s frequency response into 8 ohms with the amplifier optimized for 4 ohms and with all three sample rates; you can see that the output filters peak reaches its maximum between 30 and 40kHz, with sharp rolloffs just below half of each of the two lower-frequency rates.Fig.3 NAD M32, analog input, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.4 NAD M32, analog input, 4 ohms setting, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with ADC sample rate set to: 192kHz  , 96kHz  , 48kHz    .Fig.5 shows the effect of the M32s bass and treble controls set to their +10dB and –10dB positions and with the converter sample rate set to 96kHz. The bass control offers a range of ±10dB below 40Hz, the treble control +10/–9dB at 20kHz. Channel separation was good rather than great, at >70dB in both directions below 2kHz but decreasing to 50dB at 20kHz. Without the AP low-pass filter and with no signal present, about 260mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the speaker outputs. With the filter, the analog inputs shorted to ground, and the volume control set to \"0.0dB,\" the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured a disappointing 37dB, due to 41.5mV of residual ultrasonic noise. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to a respectable 73.5dB, and an A-weighting filter increased it further, to 86.6dB.   Levels of any residuals at the AC power-line frequency and its harmonics were negligible  .Fig.5 NAD M32, analog input, 4 ohms setting, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with Bass and Treble controls set to \"0dB,\" \"+10dB,\" and \"–10dB\"    .Fig.6 NAD M32, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The M32 is specified as delivering a maximum continuous output power of >150Wpc into 8 ohms   or 4 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive the M32 delivered 190Wpc into 8 ohms   and 180Wpc into 4 ohms  . Distortion levels at moderate powers were very low, and although the shape of the spuriae waveform at 50Wpc into 8 ohms   is obscured by high-frequency noise, the distortion signature appears to be primarily second-harmonic in nature. This was the case even at high powers into 4 ohms  . Though higher-order harmonics are visible in this graph, they all lie at or below –100dB  . Intermodulation distortion at high powers was relatively low, even into 4 ohms  . However, the noise floor begins to rise above 10kHz, and there is some peculiar spectral content present around 5kHz, though this is extremely low in level.Fig.7 NAD M32, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.8 NAD M32, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.9 NAD M32, analog input, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0026% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 NAD M32, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 NAD M32, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .The phono input preserves absolute polarity and appears to be digitized at a fixed rate of 48kHz. It offers a maximum gain of 61.75dB at the speaker outputs, which is appropriate for moving-magnet cartridges. The input impedance was also appropriate for MM cartridges, at 45k ohms at 29Hz, 39k ohms at 1kHz, but 16k ohms at 20kHz. The RIAA error was both very low and well matched between channels  , though some odd ripples are apparent in the mid-treble. The phono inputs audioband S/N ratio, ref. 1kHz at 5mV, was excellent at 71.5dB, this improving to 83.4dB when A-weighted.Fig.12 NAD M32, phono input, response with RIAA correction  .The phono inputs overload margins were also excellent, at >16dB across the audioband, and both harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion were extremely low. However, some odd low-level spectral content was again apparent in the mid-treble region.A 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in an output level of 10.34V into 8 ohms with the volume control set to \"0.0dB,\" which suggests that the M32s gain architecture is well organized. The AES/EBU and coaxial and optical TosLink inputs on the \"MDC DD S/PDIF\" module all locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz. Apples AudioMIDI app indicated that the USB input accepted 24-bit integer data with sample rates up to 192kHz. Apples USB prober utility identified the amplifier as the \"M32\" from \"NAD,\" and indicated that the USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode.The NADs impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing to either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the M32s response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression by half the sample rate  . An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   cant therefore be seen, though the noise floor starts to rise in the top audio octave and continues to rise at ultrasonic frequencies. The distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor, the second harmonic being the highest in level at –64dB  .Fig.13 NAD M32, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.14 NAD M32, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .When  NADs digital frequency response with S/PDIF data at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz, the results were the same as shown in  .4  . When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor dropped by almost 24dB, meaning that the M32 offers 20 bits worth of resolution, which is excellent. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a clean sinewave  .Fig.15 NAD M32, digital input, 4 ohms setting, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz  ,  .Fig.16 NAD M32, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.17 NAD M32, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.18 NAD M32, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .With full-scale data representing equal-level tones at 19kHz and 20kHz  , intermodulation products are relatively low in level but the rise in the noise floor in the top octave is visible. The NADs rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit AES/EBU data   was superb, with all the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave at the correct levels  . With 24-bit J-Test data  , no jitter-related sidebands were present above –130dB   via the AES/EBU, coaxial S/PDIF, and USB inputs.Fig.19 NAD M32, digital input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 600 ohms, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.20 NAD M32, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit AES/EBU data  .

       " '  Pass Labs XA60.5s   for an hour at one-third its specified maximum power of 60W into 8 ohms. This is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. A class-A amplifier, however, runs hottest when it is idling. By the end of the hour, the top panel was warm, at 107°F  , and the side-mounted heatsinks were hot, at 120°F  . With the amplifier idling for another hour, the heatsink temperature had risen to 124°F  , the top panel to 108°F  .    using Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was very slightly higher than the specified 26dB, at 26.4dB balanced and 26.55dB unbalanced.   The amplifier was non-inverting   with both input modes. The input impedance was 17k ohms, 20Hz–20kHz, for both balanced and unbalanced signals.The XA60.5s output impedance, including 6 of speaker cable, was 0.1 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.2 ohm at 20kHz. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was a mild ±0.1dB  . Into an 8 ohm resistive load  , the XA605s response was flat up to 20kHz, then rolled off to reach –3dB at 102kHz. The response rolled off a little earlier into lower impedances, but was still just 0.5dB down at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . With this wide a small-signal bandwidth, the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured short risetimes and a good square shape  .Fig.1 Pass Labs XA60.5, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Pass Labs XA60.5, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground, was a good 79dB. This improved to 86.6dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband; and further still, to 88.7dB, when the measurement was A-weighted. Fig.3 indicates that both the odd and even harmonics of the 60Hz power-supply frequency were present, though these all lay at or below –100dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Pass Labs XA60.5, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The needle of the front-panel meter remained just to the left of 12:00 at 8-ohm powers below 60W. At 60W it moved slightly to the right, reaching 1:00 at 100W into 8 ohms and 1:30 at 120W. Specified as putting out 60W into 8 ohms  , the XA60.5 considerably exceeded that power, delivering, at 1% THD, 130W into 8 ohms  , 210W into 4 ohms  , and 330W into 2 ohms  . The THD starts to rise above the noise floor at high powers, but is very low at powers of a few watts with a 1kHz signal, even into 2 ohms. The percentage of THD then slowly rises with increasing power, suggesting that the XA60.5 has only a small amount of corrective feedback  .Fig.4 Pass Labs XA60.5, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Pass Labs XA60.5, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Pass Labs XA60.5, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+Noise changed with frequency at 9V, a level where I could be sure, from the earlier measurements, that I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise. The THD was extremely low in the midrange   and hardly changed with load impedance, something that I conjecture is associated with good sound quality, as the amplifiers fundamental transfer function is not being modulated by the output current. However, the THD did rise linearly as the frequency rose—which, I conjecture, suggests that the circuit has a limited open-loop bandwidth.  Fig.7 Pass Labs XA60.5, THD+N   vs frequency at 9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the XA60.5s distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third-harmonic in nature at both moderate   and high   powers, though the second, fifth, and seventh harmonics can also be seen in  .9, all close to the –100dB level  . With the top-octave decrease in linearity seen in  .7, it came as no surprise to see some high-order intermodulation products that were fairly high in level when the XA60.5 was asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen  . However, the subjectively more objectionable second-order product at 1kHz is almost 50dB lower, at –100dB  .Fig.8 Pass Labs XA60.5, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 4 ohms, 0.02% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Pass Labs XA60.5, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 120W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Pass Labs XA60.5, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 120W peak into 4 ohms  .The Pass Labs XA60.5s measured performance is very similar to that of the stereo XA30.5  , which was favorably reviewed for Stereophile by Brian Damkroger in May 2009 and by Erick Lichte in December 2009. Both are well engineered, and each delivered more power than its modest specification would suggest.           ',\n",
       " '  Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . Before testing one of the monoblocks  , I ran it at one-third its rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes, which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-A/B output stage. As the No.53 both uses a switching output stage and is very much more efficient at turning power from the wall into voltage and current to drive the loudspeaker, this test is not really applicable. Still, at the end of that period the vertical heatsinks on the amplifiers sides were warm, at 90.1°F  . Peculiarly, the chassis was warmer than the heatsinks, at 97°F  . After Id run the amplifier for several hours at lower powers, the chassis and heatsinks had stabilized at around 110°F  . This is due to the fact that, unlike a class-D amplifier, the switching transistors are continuously passing current. The THD+noise percentage at one-third power with the amplifier cold was a very low 0.0052%; this  ure dropped to 0.00495% at the end of one hour.The No.53s voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same for balanced and unbalanced operation: 26.8dB, as specified. Both modes preserved absolute polarity, the XLR input jack being wired with pin 2 hot.   The balanced input impedance at low and middle frequencies was inconsequentially below the specified 100k ohms at 93k ohms, dropping to 64k ohms at 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance was half those  ures, as expected.The output impedance at low frequencies was very low, at 0.06 ohm, including 6 of speaker cable. This rose to 0.25 ohm at the top of the audioband, presumably due to the presence of a passive output filter on the amplifiers output to reduce the level of ultrasonic switching noise. Not only did this increase in output impedance give rise to some modification of the amplifiers frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  , there was a degree of peaking above the audioband that developed with higher impedances  . This peaking resulted in a single cycle of overshoot and well-damped ringing with an 8 ohm load  .Fig.1 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  .An amplifier with a switching output stage produces ultrasonic noise. However, with no signal, the No.53 had 7mV of noise with a center frequency of 197kHz present at its speaker terminals, which is significantly lower in level than with a conventional class-D amplifier.   The No.53s unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted, was therefore still lower than usual, at just 52.1dB. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 87.3dB, while switching in an A-weighting filter increased it further, to 89.9dB. Fig.3 shows the spectrum at low frequencies of the Mark Levinsons noise floor while it drove a 1kHz signal at 150W into 8 ohms. Note the complete absence of AC-supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics.Fig.3 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 150W into 8 ohms  .Because ultrasonic and radio-frequency noise, even at low levels, can drive the Audio Precision analyzers input into slew-rate limiting, which will produce distortion, all the following measurements of THD and IMD were taken with Audio Precisions AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which rejects noise above 200kHz and has a maximum input level of ±200V peak.Figs. 4, 5, and 6 show how the THD+N percentage in the No.53s output varied with power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms, respectively. Below 10W into each load, the measurement is dominated by noise, indicated by the upward slope of the traces with decreasing power. The actual distortion starts to rise above the noise at a few tens of watts but is extremely low in level: at or below 0.005% into the higher impedances. Defining \"clipping\" as the power at which the amplifier was producing 1% of THD+N, the No.53 readily exceeds its specified output power, clipping at 686W into 8 ohms  , 1080W into 4 ohms  , and 1500W into 2 ohms  .  Fig.4 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms  .Fig.5 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms  .Fig.6 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms  .This amplifier is a powerhouse. However, plotting the THD+N percentage against frequency at a voltage where I could be sure that the measurement was showing actual distortion rather than noise—14.15V, equivalent to 25W into 8 ohms, 50W into 4 ohms, and 100W into 2 ohms—revealed that the THD rose considerably above 500Hz, particularly into lower impedances  . I wasnt expecting this, as one supposed benefit of Mark Levinsons proprietary \"class-I\" output-stage topology is improved high-frequency linearity compared with conventional class-D designs. I also wasnt expecting what I found when  waveform of the No.53s residual distortion: a burst of high-frequency noise at every zero-crossing point  . Into lower impedances, these bursts of noise were accompanied by voltage spikes, alternately positive- and negative-going, at the exact zero-voltage points  . Note that while the actual THD+N percentage was very low, at 0.005%, this kind of behavior might be more audible than the low percentage would suggest.Fig.7 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, THD+N   vs frequency   at 14.15V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, 1kHz waveform at 173W into 8 ohms  , 0.005% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, 1kHz waveform at 340W into 4 ohms  , 0.005% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .At low frequencies, the No.53s distortion spectrum was dominated by the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  , though \"dominated\" is not really the appropriate word to use for something lying at –106dB  . This graph was taken into 8 ohms; reducing the load increased the level of the third harmonic by 10dB, with the second harmonic making an appearance just above –120dB  , but no higher-order harmonics present. However, with a 1kHz tone at the same level, a picket fence of harmonics appeared, both even- and odd-order  , which correlates with the bursts and spikes at the waveforms zero-crossing points. Again, while the levels of these harmonics are sufficiently low that it is unlikely they will be audible with music, this is still something I dont like to see.Fig.10 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 150W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 300W into 4 ohms  .Fig.12 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 150W into 8 ohms  .Surprisingly, despite the amplifiers reduced linearity at the top of the audioband, it performed well on the punishing high-frequency intermodulation test  . The difference product resulting from the equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lay at –114dB  , and the higher-order intermodulation products all lay at or below –83dB  .Fig.13 Mark Levinson No.53 Reference, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 300W peak into 4 ohms  .In almost all ways, the Mark Levinson Reference No.53 measures superbly well, especially for an amplifier with a switching output stage. But I keep returning to those bursts of noise and distortion at the signals zero-crossing points. As I said, the absolute level of this behavior was very low. But it is a very unnatural thing to happen, and I cant help wondering if this behavior lay at the root of Michael Fremers dissatisfaction with the No.53s sound. I took a listen to the Mark Levinsons driving Wilson Alexandria XLF speakers in his listening room.   The sound was initially very impressive. It had tremendous dynamic sweep, with superb control of the Wilsons woofers, tremendous clarity, and nothing identifiably wrong. However, the more I listened, the more the overall sonic picture seemed flat and uninvolving. An enigma.           ',\n",
       " '  on one of the two FMJ P49 samples I was sent  ,    . As the P49 is specified as having a maximum power output of 200Wpc into 8 ohms,   it before the measurements by running both channels at one-third that power, 67W, with a 1kHz signal into 8 ohms, for one hour. Following that period, the top panel was warm, at 109.8°F  , though the vents covering the internal heatsinks were hotter, at 134.1°F  . The THD+noise percentage at this power level was 0.001% with the amplifier cold, but 0.025% with it hot.Peculiarly, I heard the P49 emit a mechanical whine at continuous levels greater than 54Wpc into 8 ohms. Recording this sound with a microphone held over the vents in the top panel revealed that it was related to the signal frequency; eg, with a 1kHz signal, the whine comprised tones at 2, 4, and 6kHz, etc.; with a 2kHz signal, the sound comprised tones at 4 and 8kHz, etc. This behavior was obviously related to the power-supply voltage-rail switching associated with the class-G output stage, as this switching occurs twice each half-cycle once the output power exceeds the threshold. But it is fair to note that I could hear nothing amiss in my listening room with music playing, only in the quiet surrounds of my tiny test lab with pure tones at high powers.The P49s voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms with unbalanced drive was exactly 31dB with the gain set to \"31,\" 25dB with it set to \"25.\" Unusually, the balanced gains were 6dB lower than these  ures, though this agrees with the specification. In bridged-mono mode, the gain was 6dB higher for both unbalanced and balanced inputs. The unbalanced input impedance was 9.6k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz, which will be a little on the low side for some tube preamplifiers; the balanced input impedance was 9.6k ohms per signal phase; ie, 19.2k ohms overall. Both unbalanced and balanced inputs preserved absolute polarity, the XLR jacks being wired with pin 2 hot.The small-signal output impedance was a little higher than usual for a solid-state design, at 0.15 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.19 ohm at 20kHz.   With stereo operation, the modulation of the P49s frequency response that results from the interaction between the amplifiers source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was a small ±0.15dB  , while into an 8 ohm resistive load the response rolled off sharply above 40kHz, reaching –3dB at 100kHz  . The response rolled off a little earlier into 2 ohms  , but was still basically flat in the audioband. The response in bridged-mono mode was identical to that in stereo mode. Correlating with the wide small-signal bandwidth, the P49s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms had very short risetimes  . Though a small degree of overshoot can be seen in this graph, there is no ringing.Fig.1 Arcam FMJ P49, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Arcam FMJ P49, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was superb, at >100dB in both directions below 3kHz, and still >80dB at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, measured with the inputs shorted to ground, measured 78.7dB in the left channel, 79.9dB in the right. These ratios respectively improved to 84.5 and 87.7dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, with A-weighting giving further improvement, to 88.1 and 90.1dB. The level of random noise in the P49s outputs was extremely low, but the slightly less good S/N ratios in the left channel were due to there being very low levels of spuriae present at 60Hz and its odd harmonics  . These are perhaps due to the signal circuitry for that channel being closer to the large toroidal power transformer. They were slightly higher in level when the amplifier was hot than when it was cold.Fig.3 Arcam FMJ P49, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .With one channel driven, the P49 comfortably exceeded its specified maximum power of 200Wpc into 8 ohms, clipping at 250W into 8 ohms or 24dBW  , with clipping defined as the output power when the THD+N present in the output reached 1%. Into 4 ohms  , the Arcam clipped at the specified 400W  , while in bridged-mono mode   it clipped at 750W into 8 ohms  .Fig.4 Arcam FMJ P49, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Arcam FMJ P49, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Arcam FMJ P49, bridged-mono mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+N changed with frequency at a level   where I could be sure I was measuring distortion rather than noise. Other than a small rise in the top two octaves, the distortion was very low in level into 8 and 4 ohms.   The P49, however, was less comfortable driving the demanding 2 ohm load at this signal level  . In bridged-mono mode  , the top-octave rise in THD+N was greater, but was still 0.002% at a level of 67W into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Arcam FMJ P49, THD+N   vs frequency at 17.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .I looked at the spectral content of the distortion at a level—67Wpc into 8 ohms—where the class-G voltage-rail switching was operating. Even so, unlike the Creek Evolution 100A amplifier, reviewed in July 2015  , which has a similar output-stage topology, no switching artifacts can be seen in the residual distortion waveform  . This graph suggests that the distortion is primarily third-harmonic in nature, and while spectral analysis at a slightly higher level with the amplifier cold   reveals that the second harmonic is also present, the left channel   shows significantly lower distortion than the right  . The second and third harmonics are higher in bridged-mono mode  , though it is fair to note that this graph was taken with the amplifier hot. Intermodulation distortion was very low, even at high power into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Arcam FMJ P49, 1kHz waveform at 67W into 8 ohms, 0.0018% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Arcam FMJ P49, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Arcam FMJ P49, bridged-mono mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Arcam FMJ P49, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Its measured performance indicates that Arcams FMJ P49 is a well-engineered amplifier, with no problems resulting from its use of a class-G output stage. Prolonged running at power levels greater than the class-G voltage-rail transition did appear to raise distortion levels, but not to anywhere near the point where they could lead to audible problems.— John AtkinsonFootnote 1: See  .8 here.

       " '  of the Threshold T-200 was made in the amplifiers unbalanced mode, with selected measurements made in the balanced mode. Unless otherwise noted, the results presented are for the unbalanced con uration. The sample tested   was different from the sample auditioned by RD. Threshold submitted a second sample for measurement, to expedite the completion of the review by minimizing shipping and customs delays between Santa Fe and RDs abode in the Great White North of Toronto, Canada.Following the 1/3-power, one-hour preconditioning test, the T-200s heatsinks were very warm, but could be touched comfortably for an indefinite period. The T-200 is noninverting in the unbalanced mode; in its balanced con uration, pin 2 is con ured as the positive leg, pin 3 the negative.The T-200s input impedance measured 49.2k ohms unbalanced, 926 ohms balanced. The latter  ure is not a typographical error—the balanced input impedance was under 1k ohms. This probably reveals an attempt to maximize power transfer by closely matching the output impedance of the preamp with the input impedance of the power amp. The only other manufacturer I know of who does this is the Jeff Rowland Design Group, and they provide a switch that allows the user to select a higher balanced input impedance.I have serious reservations about this design philosophy; suffice it to say that the input of a power amplifier responds to voltage, not power. In any event, only a preamplifier capable of performing properly with this low a load impedance  —or, alternately, one with a very low output impedance  —should be used with the balanced inputs of the T-200. For general use, the T-200s unbalanced inputs would be the safer bet.The output impedance of the T-200 was 0.02 ohms at either 1kHz or 20Hz, increasing to 0.026 ohms at 20kHz. Voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 28dB unbalanced, 26.9dB balanced. DC offset was moderate at 7mV in the left channel, 19.5mV in the right. Signal/noise   measured 89.2dB.Fig.1 shows the frequency response of the T-200. The results shown are for 1W output into 8 ohms  . Theres little difference between the balanced and unbalanced modes here. The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave is shown in  .2. Theres only a virtually imperceptible degree of rounding at the leading edge, and a fast risetime. The 1kHz squarewave response was close to perfect, and is not shown.Fig.1 Threshold T-200, frequency response into 8 ohms in unbalanced mode   and in balanced mode    .Fig.2 Threshold T-200, 10kHz squarewave.The crosstalk shown in  .3 indicates nearly identical performance between channels. The increased crosstalk at high frequencies is typical of many two-channel products, and is simply the result of capacitive coupling between the channels.Fig.3 Threshold T-200, crosstalk: L–R  , R–L  .The T-200s THD+noise vs frequency curves are plotted in  .4, with the balanced result at the top, the unbalanced result at the bottom. Both are extremely low—in fact, the result here is primarily noise. Theres a slight rise at the highest frequencies into a 2 ohm load  , but its relatively insignificant. The distortion waveform at a level of 50W into 2 ohms is shown in  .5—at the levels we normally use to obtain this result, the distortion was impossible to pick out of the noise. The distortion is heavily second-harmonic, with some higher-level harmonics plus noise evident. There was a similar result into higher load impedances  .Fig.4 Threshold T-200, THD+noise   vs frequency at  : 1W into 8 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, 4W into 2 ohms, unbalanced; 1W into 8 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, 4W into 2 ohms, balanced.Fig.5 Threshold T-200, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 2 ohms  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .The spectrum of the T-200s output driving 50Hz into 4 ohms at a level of 133W   is shown in  .6. All of the artifacts are under –90dB  —a superb result, and one of the best Ive ever seen with this test. Surprisingly, the second-harmonic component seen in  .5 is absent. Fig.7 shows the spectrum of the T-200s output reproducing a combined 19+20kHz signal—the intermodulation products resulting from an input signal consisting of an equal combination of these two frequencies—at 111W RMS into 4 ohms  . The largest artifacts here are at 18kHz and 21kHz  . Of the remainder, only the one at 17kHz is marginally higher than –80dB  . The 19+20kHz spectral response at 61W into 8 ohms indicates even lower intermodulation levels  .Fig.6 Threshold T-200, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 133W into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Threshold T-200, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–22kHz, 19+20kHz at 111W into 4 ohms  .The 1kHz THD+N vs output power curves are shown in  .8. The power increases substantially as the load impedance decreases, though doesnt quite double with each halving of impedance down to 2 ohms  . [] The T-200s discrete-clipping levels   are shown in Table 1.Fig.8 Threshold T-200, distortion   vs output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, and 2 ohms.Finally, the THD+N vs output for the T-200 in bridged mode are shown for both 8 ohm and 4 ohm loads in  .9. As expected, the T-200 puts out considerably more power in the bridged mode, though this mode of operation was not auditioned.Fig.9 Threshold T-200 in bridged mode, distortion   vs output power into  : 8 ohms and 4 ohms.These test-bench results show the Threshold T-200 to be a first-rate amplifier. input impedance: use of the balanced input with the T-200 will require the user to carefully choose his or her preamp if problems are to be avoided.—Thomas J.

       " ' At a higher 50W level into 8 ohms, the residual distortion   was primarily third-harmonic; though at 0.0045%, this is probably of academic interest only. Lowering the load impedance to 2 ohms and keeping the output voltage constant, resulting in 200W dissipation in the load, brought up the level of second-harmonic distortion, as is shown in  .5.  Fig.4 Mark Levinson No.33H, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .  Fig.5 Mark Levinson No.33H, 1kHz waveform at 200W into 2 ohms  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .  The mainly third-harmonic nature of the No.33Hs distortion can also be seen in  .6, a spectral analysis of the amplifiers output while it drives a low-frequency sinewave   at two-thirds its nominal output power into 4 ohms. The only significant distortion component is the third harmonic at 150Hz, this a low -80dB  . A power-supply artifact can just be seen at 180Hz, but this is 100dB down! The high-level, high-frequency intermodulation plot   was also very clean, the 1kHz difference component lying at -95dB  , and the 18kHz and 21kHz components still better than 80dB down from peak level.  Fig.6 Mark Levinson No.33H, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC-1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .  Fig.7 Mark Levinson No.33H, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-22kHz, 19+20kHz at 25V into 4 ohms  .  Finally, the big Levinson is a powerhouse of an amplifier, comfortably exceeding its rated power. Specified at 150W into 8 ohms, it actually didnt clip   into that load until 265W  ! And the wall AC supply, at 114.5V, was starting to droop—this means that, with its own dedicated 30A line, this amplifier will probably put out 300W into 8 ohms.  Fig.8 Mark Levinson No.33H, distortion   vs output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, and 2 ohms.  Into 4 ohms, the maximum output power almost doubled, to 500W  ; into 2 ohms, 900W was available  .   As we dont have a dummy 1 ohm resistive load capable of sinking the almost 2kW that the Mark Levinson is presumably capable of putting out into this load, I wasnt able to check its clipping power into 1 ohms. However, the fractional decibel drop in dBW each time the load is halved suggests that this amplifier behaves as an almost perfect voltage source.           ',\n",
       " '  on one of the Accustic Arts Mono IIs, S/N M2-1JB1258,    . I repeated some of the tests on S/N 1259, the sample that Jason Victor Serinus found had developed a hum toward the end of his auditioning.  ,   first sample of the Mono II by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time the side-mounted heatsinks were hot, at 120.6°F  . The top panel was also hot, at 104.1°F  .The Accustic Arts voltage gain into 8 ohms is specified as 31dB. I measured 30.8dB into 8 ohms with the single-ended input; unusually, the balanced inputs gain was 6dB lower. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   for both inputs. The balanced input impedance is specified as 40k ohms, which was confirmed by my measurements. However, I measured 28k ohms at low and middle frequencies for the unbalanced input impedance, dropping to 23k ohms at 20kHz. While this is lower than the specified 100k ohms, the difference is inconsequential.The Mono IIs output impedance was very low, at 0.074 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising very slightly to 0.082 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by less than ±0.1dB  . The audioband response into 8 ohms   is flat up to 20kHz, with an ultrasonic rolloff reaching –3dB at 100kHz. The responses of the two samples matched very closely. The Mono II reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with very short risetimes, and no overshoot or ringing  .Fig.1 Accustic Arts Mono II, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Accustic Arts Mono II, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Despite JVS finding that S/N 1259 developed a hum, I didnt find any significant differences in the two samples signal/noise ratios. The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground, was a high 79dB, which improved to 86dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 89.2dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the Mono IIs noise floors   revealed that while 1259   did have higher levels of odd-order harmonics of the 60Hz power-line frequency than 1258, these spuriae were still very low in level and will not be audible. I dont know why, therefore, JVS found that 1259 developed a hum.Fig.3 Accustic Arts Mono II, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Accustic Arts specifies the Mono IIs maximum power as 300W into 8 ohms  , 500W into 4 ohms  , and 700W into 2 ohms  . With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%, I found that the Mono II failed to meet its specified powers. Fig.4 was taken with 1258 and indicates that the Accustic Arts amplifier clipped at 220W into 8 ohms  . I repeated this test with 1259 and got an identical result. Into 4 ohms  , the Mono II again failed to meet its specified power, delivering 385W   at 1% THD+N. Into 2 ohms  , the Mono II clipped at 575W  .Fig.4 Accustic Arts Mono II, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Accustic Arts Mono II, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Accustic Arts Mono II, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.These   with a balanced input signal. I repeated them with a single-ended signal, and while the distortion was higher at low powers than it had been with balanced drive, I got the same clipping powers. This is still a high-powered amplifier, however. Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that the distortion with a balanced 1kHz signal is very low at all powers below clipping. However, when I tried to plot how the THD+N percentage varied as I swept the frequency down from 20kHz to 20Hz at a moderate power level, 50W into 8 ohms, the amplifiers protection operated as soon as it was fed the 20kHz tone. I had to reduce the level of the input signal by more than 6dB before I could perform the test without the Mono II turning off its output. The results at this lower level are shown in  .7. The THD+N in this graph is very low at low frequencies into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  . However, as the impedance dropped, the distortion started to rise at an increasingly lower frequency, reaching high levels at the top of the audioband. This behavior suggests that the Mono II has a limited open-loop bandwidth, with less gain margin available for corrective negative feedback to be applied as the frequency rises  .Fig.7 Accustic Arts Mono II, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.975V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The waveform of the residual distortion and noise with a 1kHz signal   suggests that the subjectively benign second harmonic is dominant, which was confirmed by spectral analysis  . The second harmonic is still very low in level, however, at –110dB   and rose by just 6dB when I reduced the load impedance to 4 ohms. When I tried to examine the Accustic Arts intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones, I again found that the amplifiers protection circuitry limited the power at which I could perform the test. At the highest power I could test the Mono II with this signal, equivalent to 40W peak into 4 ohms, the second-order difference product lay at a very low –90dB   and higher-order intermodulation products were even lower in level  .Fig.8 Accustic Arts Mono II, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.0053% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Accustic Arts Mono II, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Accustic Arts Mono II, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms  .I was puzzled by the Accustic Arts Mono IIs measured performance. Some aspects are excellent—the low levels of noise; the very low levels of distortion at low and middle frequencies with balanced drive; the dominance of the second harmonic in the distortion signature; the reproduction of squarewaves; and the generally excellent matching between the two samples. But the Mono IIs inability to meet its specified powers and the dramatic rise in distortion at high frequencies into low impedances are disappointing.The Accustic Arts Mono II is capable of much higher powers at low and middle frequencies than it is at high frequencies, especially into low impedances. This may not be an issue with classical orchestral music, chamber music, acoustic jazz, or bluegrass, but it could lead to problems with highly compressed rock that has high levels of energy in the top octaves. I was also surprised by the apparently limited open-loop bandwidth  , which is uncommon in modern solid-state amplifiers. Footnote 1: See  .3 here.          ',\n",
       " '  one Pass Labs XA200.8   for an hour at one-third its measured maximum power into 8 ohms—thermally, the worst case for an amplifier with a class-AB output stage but not for a true class-A amplifier, which runs at its hottest with no signal. By the end of the hour, the top panel was warm, at 99.4°F  , and the side-mounted heatsinks were hotter, at 118.1°F  . Although Pass Labs specifies the XA200.8 operating in class-A, I suspect that even with its massive heatsinking, the amplifier doesnt have sufficient bias current to allow class-A operation up to its specified maximum power.     . The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was slightly lower than the specified 26dB, at 24.85dB for the balanced input and the expected 6dB lower for the unbalanced input  . The amplifier was non-inverting   with both inputs. Its balanced input impedance was the specified 100k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping slightly to 93k ohms at 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance is specified as 50k ohms; my estimate was 55k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 38k ohms at 20kHz.The XA200.8s output impedance was 0.11 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.15 ohm at 20kHz. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was just ±0.1dB  . Into an 8 ohm resistive load  , the XA200.8s response was flat up to 20kHz, then rolled off to reach –3dB around 120kHz. The response rolled off a little earlier into lower impedances, but was still just 0.5dB down at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . With this wide a small-signal bandwidth, the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured short risetimes and a well-squared shape  .Fig.1 Pass Labs XA200.8, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Pass Labs XA200.8, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground, was an excellent 83dB. This improved to 88.2dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband—and was even better, at 92.1dB, when the measurement was A-weighted. Like the other Pass Labs amplifiers we have reviewed, the XA200.8 is quiet. As with the XA60.8 monoblock that we reviewed in December 2017, both the odd and even harmonics of the 60Hz power-supply frequency were present in the amplifiers noise floor, though these all lay at or below –100dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.3 Pass Labs XA200.8, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The XA200.8 is specified as delivering 200W into 8 ohms  . Using our definition of clipping—ie, when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%—the Pass Labs amplifier clipped at 258W into 8 ohms  , 480W into 4 ohms  , and 700W into 2 ohms  . The THD begins to rise above the noise floor at powers greater than a couple of watts, but remains at or below 0.1% below 100W into any of these impedances. As with the XA60.8, the percentage of THD+N in the XA200.8s output slowly rises with increasing power, suggesting that the amplifier uses only a small amount of corrective feedback.Fig.4 Pass Labs XA200.8, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Pass Labs XA200.8, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Pass Labs XA200.8, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+N changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was extremely low in the midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  , and still below 0.1% into 2 ohms  . It rose linearly as the frequency increased, the three traces converging in the high treble—which suggests that, again like the XA60.8, the circuit has limited open-loop bandwidth.Fig.7 Pass Labs XA200.8, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the XA200.8s distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  . Still, at low frequencies into lower impedances, the second harmonic rises to equal the level of the third, and some higher-order harmonics appear  , though the latter all lie at or below –100dB  .Fig.8 Pass Labs XA200.8, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.06% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Pass Labs XA200.8, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .As with the other Pass Labs XA-series amplifiers we have reviewed, the XA200.8s top-octave decrease in linearity   is associated with some higher-order intermodulation products that were fairly high in level when the amplifier was asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at high power into 4 ohms  . Even so, the second-order difference product at 1kHz, which will be more audible than the higher-order products, lies at a low –74dB  .Fig.10 Pass Labs XA200.8, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Pass Labs XA200.8, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .The measured performance of the Pass Laboratories XA200.8 reveals some well-balanced audio engineering.

At the end of that time, the internal heatsinks were fairly warm, at 105.7°F  , though the top panels temperature was just 82.6°F  . As JVS had told me that the M1Xs sound quality improved after a lengthy break-in, I then ran the amplifier at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms for another 30 minutes before examining its measured performance. The heatsink and top panel temperatures had increased only slightly after this period, to107.4°F   and 83.4°F  , respectively.The Esoterics voltage gain is specified as 28.5dB; I measured 28.13dB into 8 ohms for the balanced input, 28.27dB for the unbalanced input. The M1X preserved absolute polarity   with both input types. The specified input impedances are 100k ohms, balanced, and 10k ohms, unbalanced. I measured an even higher 180k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz for the balanced input, dropping slightly to a still very high 146k ohms at 20kHz. The unbalanced input was 9.8k ohms at low and midrange frequencies, dropping to 9.2k ohms at the top of the audioband.Fig.1 Esoteric M1X, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Esoteric M1X, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Esoterics output impedance was a low 0.24 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.265 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was very small, at ±0.1dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB just above 100kHz, though the increasing output impedance at very high frequencies means that the ultrasonic rolloff into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms   was greater. The M1Xs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   was superb, with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.3 Esoteric M1X, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was a very good 77.4dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 85dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 87.7dB when A-weighted. While spuriae at the even-order harmonics of the 60Hz power-supply frequency were present in the Esoterics noisefloor  , these are negligible, at –100dB and below ref. 1W into 8 ohms. I repeated this spectral analysis with a wire connecting the grounding terminal on the amplifiers back panel to the Audio Precisions chassis ground, but there was no difference in the levels of the power supply–related spuriae.Fig.4 Esoteric M1X, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Esoteric M1X, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The Esoteric M1X exceeded its specified output powers of 300W into 8 ohms and 600W into 4 ohms  . With our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the M1X clipped with a 1kHz signal at 340W into 8 ohms   and at 620W into 4 ohms  . Although the Esoteric amplifiers maximum power into 2 ohms isnt specified, I measured 1050W into this load at 1% THD+N. The wall voltage had dropped from 120.2V to 116V at this power.Fig.6 Esoteric M1X, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Figs.4 and 5 indicate that distortion was very low below actual waveform clipping. I examined how the percentage of THD+N changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The distortion was extremely low in the midrange into 8 ohms   but rose in the top octaves, and it was higher into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms  . However, even at this very high power into 2 ohms, the THD+N remained well below 0.1%.Fig.7 Esoteric M1X, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.051% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Esoteric M1X, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .The Esoterics distortion driving 1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms was predominantly the third harmonic  , lying at –66dB  . Though higher-order, predominantly odd-order harmonics are present in this graph, these are all low in level. The third harmonic rose almost to –60dB   at the same voltage into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Esoteric M1X, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .When the M1X drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 50W into 8 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –94dB  . Higher-order intermodulation products lay at the same level or lower. At the same voltage into 4 ohms, the intermodulation products rose by 3dB.The Esoteric M1X did well on the test bench, offering very high power with low distortion and noise.           ',\n",

At the end of this time, the side-mounted heatsinks were hot, at 116.7°F  . The top panel was a little cooler, at 98.9°F  .The Parasounds voltage gain into 8 ohms, set to Normal, measured 29.2dB from the balanced inputs, 29.4dB from the unbalanced inputs. Switching the gain to Low reduced both gains by 6.4dB. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both balanced and unbalanced input signals. Although slightly lower than specified, the balanced input impedance was still very high, at 92k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to 89k ohms at 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance was 44k ohms at low and middle frequencies, 36k ohms at the top of the audioband.The Parasounds output impedance was a very low 0.067 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.085 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was negligible, at ±0.1dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB just below 100kHz and was flat to almost 20kHz, which correlates with the JC 1+s superb reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . Commendably, there was no overshoot or ringing with the squarewave response.Fig.1 Parasound JC 1+, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Parasound JC 1+, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and the bias set to Normal, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was an excellent 75.8dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms, this ratio improving to 87.25dB when the measurement was A-weighted and to 114dB when referenced to the amplifiers specified clipping power. Low-level spuriae at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its harmonics were present in the Parasounds noise floor  .Fig.3 Parasound JC 1+, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The JC 1+ is specified as being able to deliver 450W into 8 ohms  , 850W into 4 ohms  , and 1300W into 2 ohms  , all at 0.15% distortion. Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the Parasound exceeded its specified powers into 8 ohms, clipping with a 1kHz signal at 500W into 8 ohms  . It didnt quite meet its specified power into lower impedances, clipping at 830W into 4 ohms   and at 1200W into 2 ohms  . However, it is fair to note that I dont hold the AC wall voltage constant when I test an amplifiers clipping power. With the Halo JC 1+ idling, the wall voltage measured 121.8V. With the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms, the supply voltage had dropped to 119.4V, which explains the slight shortfall in maximum power.Fig.4 Parasound JC 1+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Parasound JC 1+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Parasound JC 1+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The shape of the traces in  s.4–6 suggested that, below a few tens of watts, the measured THD+N percentage was dominated by noise. I therefore examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was very low in the midrange into 8 ohms   but rose both into lower impedances   and at higher frequencies. Even so, other than at 200W into 2 ohms  , the THD remained below 0.1% up to the 20kHz limit of this graph.Fig.7 Parasound JC 1+, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The JC 1+s distortion was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  , and higher harmonics are all very low in level  . The second harmonic lies at a low –86dB in this graph   and didnt rise in level when I reduced the load impedance to 4 ohms. When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –89dB  , though higher-order intermodulation products were slightly higher in level.Fig.8 Parasound JC 1+, 1kHz waveform at 53W into 8 ohms, 0.0049% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Parasound JC 1+, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Parasound JC 1+, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .Like its predecessor, the Parasound JC 1+ offers a lot of low-noise, low-distortion power, and it is safe to say that its distortion signature will have no effect on the amplifiers sonic character.

       " 'Usually, when I measure an amplification or digital product, I carry the box down the stairs to my basement, where I have my listening room and test lab. However, the Accustic Arts AMP V was too heavy for me to do this. Instead, I rolled it in its wheeled flightcase into the vestibule outside the listening room, removed the flightcase cover, and left the amplifier sitting in the flightcase   at the top of the small flight of stairs. I then set up my   system   with its dedicated PC, my analog and digital oscilloscopes, test loads, etc, at the foot of the stairs. The amplifiers two AC leads were plugged into the closest wall socket, along with those for the test system.  Before I performed the testing,   amplifier by running it at one-eighth its specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes, as recommended by the CEA. After the preconditioning, the heatsinks on the amplifiers sides were hot, at 113.4°F  . The top panel was warm, at 105.0°F  .Soon after I began the testing—after the preconditioning period—the 15A circuit breaker serving the wall socket into which everything was plugged tripped.   I therefore ran two long extension cords from the 20A wall sockets in the test lab, one for the amplifier, the other for the test gear, and started where I had left off.The AMP Vs specified voltage gain is 30dB. I measured 30.9dB into 8 ohms for the balanced inputs and 30.75dB for the single-ended inputs. All the inputs and outputs preserved absolute polarity, ie, were noninverting. The input impedance was lower than the specified values: 10k ohms balanced, across the audioband, rather than the specified 32k ohms; the unbalanced input impedance was 6.7k ohms compared with the specified 15k ohms. Still, both values are high enough that compatibility problems are unlikely. With the Damping Factor correction switched off, the output impedance   was low, at 0.14 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz. Turning on the Damping Factor increased the output impedance slightly, to 0.2 ohm. Even so, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by less than ±0.2dB  . The response into 8 ohms   was down by 1.5dB at 200kHz, and the AMP Vs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured short risetimes with no overshoot or ringing. Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the balanced inputs. The frequency and squarewave responses were the same for the unbalanced inputs and with Damping Factor on and off.Fig.1 Accustic Arts AMP V, Damping Factor On, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Accustic Arts AMP V, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Likely as a result of its dual-mono construction, the amplifiers channel separation was a superb 110dB in both directions below 1kHz, falling to 80dB at the top of the audioband, presumably due to capacitive coupling between channels. Measured with the single-ended inputs shorted to ground, the Accustics wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio was a good 72.3dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  . This ratio improved to 80.5dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 83.3dB when the reading was A-weighted. The spectra shown in  .4 were taken at 1Wpc into 8 ohms. Spuriae can be seen at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, which will be due to magnetic coupling from the two massive power transformers. However, these spuriae are very low in level.Fig.3 Accustic Arts AMP V, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms    .Fig.4 Accustic Arts AMP V, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+N varied with output power, with clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the amplifiers output reached 1%. With both channels driven into 8 ohms, the AMP V didnt meet its specified maximum power of 900Wpc   at 1% THD+N, clipping at 665Wpc  ; note, however, that I dont hold the wall voltage constant during the testing, and the wall voltage dropped from 119.2V with the amplifier idling to 114.2V with both channels of the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms. Similarly, into 4 ohms, again with both channels driven, I measured clipping power of 890Wpc  ; the specified value is 1360Wpc  . This time, the wall voltage dropped to 111.5V.Fig.5 Accustic Arts AMP V, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.As I always do, I saved the measurement of the AMP Vs clipping power into 2 ohms until the very end. However, when I performed my penultimate test, which was to measure how THD+N varied with frequency at 20V  , the amplifier turned itself off after 10 seconds of driving 2 ohms at this level  . I had assumed that this would be due to protection circuitry doing its job; however, after I removed the power cables, let the amplifier cool down, and plugged it back in, it wouldnt turn on again. Each of the two AC power sockets has two fuses; all four were okay. The AMP V also has internal fuses, which must have gone open-circuit. I removed the 10 bolts that hold the top panel in place, but I wasnt able to remove it. I tried everything I could think of that did not present a substantial risk of damaging the finish.Fig.6 Accustic Arts AMP V, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Returning to the measurements: Fig.6 shows that the distortion is very low over most of the audioband into both 8 and 4 ohms, though a little higher in the right channel   than the left  . The THD rises in the top octave—this will be due to a restricted open-loop bandwidth reducing the amount of negative feedback available—but it remains below 0.17% at 20kHz into 4 ohms.The waveform of the THD+N at 100Wpc into 8 ohms with the 1kHz fundamental notched out   suggests that the distortion signature consists primarily of low-order harmonics. The spectrum of the AMP Vs output with a 50Hz signal at that level into 8 ohms   shows that the second harmonic lay at –106dB   in both channels, the third harmonic at –96dB in the left channel   and at –88dB in the right channel  . Supply-related spuriae are visible, but all lie at or below –96dB. Fig.9 shows the spectrum of the AMP Vs output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 100Wpc. The second-order difference product at 1kHz lies at a negligible –100dB  , and the higher-order intermodulation products are all at or below –86dB  .Fig.7 Accustic Arts AMP V, 1kHz waveform at 100Wpc into 8 ohms, 0.0039% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Accustic Arts AMP V, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 8 ohms    .Fig.9 Accustic Arts AMP V, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 8 ohms    .The Accustic Arts AMP V offers extremely high power coupled with extremely low distortion. But why did those internal fuses blow—assuming thats what happened—after a short while driving 200Wpc into 2 ohms with high-frequency test tones? I dont know what caused it, but I can confidently say that this is unlikely to happen with a music signal. Footnote 1: As the flightcase base rose only a couple of inches up the sides of this large amplifier, ventilation was unlikely to be significantly affected.          ',\n",

At the end of that time, the heatsinks were hot, at 121.3°F  , though the top panel was just warm at 103.9°F  .The Schiits voltage gain is specified as 22×, or 28dB; I measured 27.55dB into 8 ohms for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs. The Tyr preserved absolute polarity   with both input types. Both the balanced and unbalanced input impedances are specified as 47k ohms. I measured a still-high 21.5k ohms for the unbalanced input at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to 18.1k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 43.2k ohms at low and middle frequencies and 40.2k ohms at the top of the audioband.The Schiits output impedance was a very low 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.124 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore negligible, at ±0.1dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 1dB just above 100kHz, though the increasing output impedance at very high frequencies means that the ultrasonic rolloff into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms   was greater. The Tyrs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   was superb, with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Schiit Tyr, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Schiit Tyr, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was an excellent 88.4dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 96.7dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 101.4dB when A-weighted. This last S/N ratio is very close to the specification of 120dBA when referenced to the maximum power. While spuriae were present in the Schiits noisefloor at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its harmonics  , these were negligible at –100dB and below, ref. 1W into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Schiit Tyr, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Schiit Tyr is specified as being able to deliver 200W into 8 ohms   and 350W into 4 ohms  . With our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the Tyr exceeded its specified powers, clipping with a 1kHz signal at 252W into 8 ohms   and at 360W into 4 ohms  . The THD+N was very low below actual waveform clipping, though the trace in  .5 has a peculiar discontinuity above 200W. I repeated this test and found this behavior repeatable. I suspect it is related to the amplifiers protection circuitry, though I didnt notice any flashing of the front-panel lights.Fig.4 Schiit Tyr, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Schiit Tyr, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms. The THD+N was very low in the midrange into 8 ohms   but rose in the low bass and top octaves, and into 4 ohms  .Fig.6 Schiit Tyr, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The Schiits distortion with 1kHz into 8 ohms was predominantly the third harmonic  , though the second and fourth harmonics were higher with a 50Hz signal into the same load  , at –80dB   and –90dB  . These harmonics were lower in level at the same voltage into 4 ohms   and were joined by the third harmonic at –88dB  . When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50W into 8 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –87dB  , with higher-order intermodulation products still lower in level, at –97dB. At the same voltage into 4 ohms, the 1kHz product dropped to –90dB; though the products at 18kHz and 21kHz were higher in level, this was a still-low –83dB.Fig.7 Schiit Tyr, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0033% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Schiit Tyr, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Schiit Tyr, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Schiit Tyr, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .The Schiit Tyr offers superb measured performance.

       " ' Sidebar 4: 1997 Measurements  All measurements on the Rowland Model 2 were made with the amplifier in its high-impedance input setting at a gain of 26dB, unless otherwise noted. All of the measurements were, of course, balanced. And all of the measurements, again except as noted, were made with the battery functioning normally  .  Following its 1/3-power, one-hour preconditioning test, the Model 2s heatsinks were very warm but not hot. The Rowland Model 2s input impedance measured 44k ohms  . The output impedance measured under 0.025 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing to a maximum of 0.35 ohms at 20kHz. Voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 26dB  . Signal/Noise ref. 1W into 8 ohms measured 83dB over a 22Hz-22kHz bandwidth, unweighted; 72.2dB over a 10Hz-500kHz bandwidth, unweighted; and 88dB, A-weighted. Like other Rowland gear, the Model 2 is pin-3 positive at its inputs. DC offset measured a negligible 0.2mV in the left channel, 0.1mV in the right.  Fig.1 shows the frequency response of the Model 2, which is virtually flat across the audible range  . The 10kHz squarewave in  .2 shows just a slight overshoot on the leading edge, but is otherwise very good. The 1kHz squarewave, not shown, is also excellent, and also barely shows this overshoot. The squarewave response is not changed when the amplifier is switched to direct-line power  . The Model 2s crosstalk   was very low, and the two channels are very closely matched—certainly indicative of careful design, though probably not significant at such low crosstalk levels.    Fig.1 Rowland Model 2/BPS-2, frequency response at 1W into 8 ohms  .    Fig.2 Rowland Model 2/BPS-2, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.  The THD+noise vs frequency curves are plotted in  .3. The result was identical with the amplifier powered directly from the line  . The waveform of the distortion at 2W into 4 ohms is shown in  .4. It is heavily third-harmonic, though there are clearly some higher-order components, plus the usual noise visible with such low levels of distortion. The waveforms into 8 and 2 ohms   were similar.    Fig.3 Rowland Model 2/BPS-2, THD+noise vs frequency at  : 4W into 2 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, 1W into 8 ohms, 2.83V into simulated speaker load  .

The Model 2s output spectrum reproducing a 50Hz input at 100W into 4 ohms is shown in  .5 The distortion products are all extremely low—below -90dB, or 0.003%. Into our simulated loudspeaker load at a level of 21.9V, only the third harmonic   was in any way relevant, though other artifacts at less than -80dB are visible.    Fig.5 Rowland Model 2/BPS-2, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC-1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .  Fig.6 shows the amplifiers output spectrum reproducing a combination of 19+20kHz signals at 66.4W into 4 ohms  . While there are more intermodulation products visible with a 4 ohm load, in all cases the artifacts are very low—a maximum of -70dB   at 21kHz.      Fig.6 Rowland Model 2/BPS-2, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-22kHz, 19+20kHz at 66.4W into 4 ohms    The 1kHz, THD+noise vs output power for the Model 2 are shown in  .7.

I also noticed that the distortion increased gradually at high output when the amplifier was driven through the battery. For example, with one channel driven into 4 ohms, the power listed above at 1% distortion was only good for a few seconds before the distortion would start to increase gradually and constantly. After 30 seconds, it was up to 1.25% and still increasing. On line drive under the same conditions, the distortion remained stable. This suggests that the power available from the battery is slightly degraded if called upon to drive the amplifier at high power for an extended period—not typical of music.  Nevertheless, the battery-powered Rowland Model 2 produced a solid set of measurements especially notable for low distortion, noise, and crosstalk.—Thomas J. Norton          ',\n",
       " 'Since he wrote about them in his March 2009 \"Music in the Round\" column, Kalman Rubinson has been using as his reference power amplifiers Bel Cantos e.One Ref1000 Mk.2 class-D monoblocks  . Like the original Ref1000, which KR wrote about in November 2006, the Mk.2   uses Bang & Olufsens 1000ASP ICEpower modules, but with improvements in mechanical damping, parts selection, and filtering of the residual switching noise present at the amplifiers output. With the Bel Cantos driving his B&W 802D speakers, Kal found the amplifiers sounded \"even livelier and more transparent than their predecessors, with no vestige of HF grain to mar the awesome illusion....Compared with nonswitching amps such as Classés Omicron or CA-3200, the Bel Canto e.Ones could seem somewhat literal in terms of their tightly defined two-channel soundstage,\" he wrote, \"but that disappeared in multichannel use. In fact, even in stereo, I could make a case for the Bel Cantos being more truthful than the Classés, if less luxurious.\"As part of Stereophiles continuing program of publishing measurements Follow-Ups of sonically promising products that have been reviewed by the magazines regular columnists, I subjected the Ref1000M to my usual battery of tests. I mainly used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. To minimize the effect of the HF switching noise on the measurements, I used an Audio Precision passive low-pass filter ahead of each analyzer. As usual,   amplifier   by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour before performing any measurements. Like any other amplifier that uses a switching output stage, which is very efficient at converting electrical power from the wall into loudspeaker-driving current, the Bel Canto did not get hot under these conditions.The input impedance was to specification at low and middle frequencies, at 200k ohms balanced and 100k ohms unbalanced. These  ures dropped to 160k and 58k ohms at 20kHz, respectively, but these are still usefully high input impedances. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity; ie, were non-inverting. The amplifiers output impedance was <0.1 ohm in the audioband, rising to 0.35 ohm at 20kHz, due to the effect of its series low-pass filter ahead of the output terminals. The effect of this filter can be seen in  .1, which shows the amplifiers small-signal frequency response: the output into 8 ohms rolls off rapidly above 20kHz   and with our standard simulated loudspeaker  , and above 10kHz into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms  . There is some peaking evident into 2 ohms  , but even with 8 ohms, squarewaves show a well-damped overshoot  .  Fig.1 Bel Canto e.One Ref1000M, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Bel Canto e.One Ref1000M, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Bel Canto e.One Ref1000M, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Bel Canto rates the Ref1000s maximum power at >500W into 8 ohms and >1000W into 4 ohms. I measured maximum powers of 600W into 8 ohms and 1200W into 4 ohms  . With continuous drive, the amplifier turned itself off at 1kW into 2 ohms  , which was well below clipping  . Despite its minuscule size and weight, this is a very powerful amplifier. Distortion was very low in the midband and bass, particularly into high impedances, but rose in the treble  . Though the rise in THD+noise was not to an alarmingly high level into 8 ohms, this graph confirms that the Ref1000 will be more comfortable with higher-impedance speakers, where the residual distortion at relatively low powers was primarily lower-order harmonics  . Higher-order harmonics appeared into low impedances and at higher powers  , due to discontinuities at the signals zero-crossing points. These harmonics all lie at relatively low levels, however.Fig.4 Bel Canto e.One Ref1000M, THD+N  vs output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.Fig.5 Bel Canto e.One Ref1000M, THD+N  vs frequency at 13.7V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.6 Bel Canto e.One Ref1000M, 1kHz waveform at 6W into 8 ohms  , 0.008% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Bel Canto e.One Ref1000M, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 215W into 4 ohms  .Testing for intermodulation products with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones proved problematic, because there appeared to be a \"history effect\" at levels much above 20V. At first, the REF100 Mk.2 reproduced the signal without any problem, but after a short while, the waveform squared and remained clipped until the drive signal was reduced. Fig.8 shows the spectrum of the Bel Cantos output at the highest continuous level it would deliver into 4 ohms with this demanding signal. While the difference product at 1kHz is very low, the higher-order components at 18 and 21kHz lie just below –60dB  .Fig.8 Bel Canto e.One Ref1000M, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 4 ohms  .This latest version of Bel Cantos e.One Ref1000M monoblock offers very high power from its diminutive chassis. It does work best with higher-impedance loudspeakers, however, and at lower frequencies. Fortunately, music rarely includes enough high top-octave energy to reveal the amplifiers unhappiness in this region.           ',\n",
       " '  Luxman L-509X    .  , I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time, the Luxmans top panel was warm, at 95°F  , and the small metal grilles above the heatsinks were hotter, at 107.7°F  .Looking first at the line inputs: The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms, with the volume control set to the maximum, measured 43.4dB for both balanced and unbalanced signals. The meters on the amplifiers front panel appear to be calibrated so that \"–20dB\" corresponds to just over 1W into 8 ohms. With the rear-panel switch set to Normal, the balanced inputs inverted absolute polarity, meaning that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 3 hot, which the manual confirms. The polarity can be changed to pin 2 hot with the switch. The unbalanced inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The unbalanced input impedance was a relatively high 47k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, decreasing slightly at 20kHz to a still-high 36k ohms. The balanced input impedance was 52k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz.The headphone output impedance was very high, at 800 ohms at all audio frequencies. As the maximum gain at this output was the same as at the speaker terminals, I suspect that the headphone output is implemented by placing a resistor in series with the power-amplifier stage. The output impedance at the speaker terminals was a very low 0.075 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.11 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the modulation of the L-509Xs frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was less than ±0.1dB  . This graph was taken with the tone controls defeated and with the volume control set to its maximum; commendably, there was no change in response at lower volume-control settings. The Luxmans frequency response is down by 3dB at 100kHz; as a result, a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with very short risetimes  , and there was no overshoot or ringing with a resistive load.Fig.1 Luxman L-509X, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Luxman L-509X, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Bass and Treble controls offered maximum cuts and boosts of 9dB, but with a slight difference between the channels  . It turned out that when I enabled the tone controls, that also activated the Balance control, which was slightly favoring the right channel. With the Balance control centered, channel separation was good rather than great, at 75dB in both directions. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 75.4dB, this improving to a respectable 82.6dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 85.7dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor   indicated that all the AC-supply harmonics lay below –95dB.Fig.3 Luxman L-509X, response of Bass and Treble controls set to their mid and maximum boost/cut positions  .Fig.4 Luxman L-509X, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Luxman specifies the L-509X as offering 120Wpc into 8 ohms   and 220Wpc into 4 ohms  , and the amplifier comfortably exceeded its specified power even with both channels driven. With clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1%, I measured clipping powers of 154Wpc into 8 ohms   and 250Wpc into 4 ohms  . The downward slope of the traces in these graphs indicates that the distortion lies beneath the noise floor below 50W or so. To be certain I was measuring actual distortion, I examined how the THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a fairly high level, 20V  . Even so, the THD+N was extremely low in the bass and midrange, and while there was the usual rise in the treble, this was still not to a significant amount  .Fig.5 Luxman L-509X, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Luxman L-509X, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Luxman L-509X, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The THD+N waveform at this level   indicates that the distortion is predominantly second-harmonic in nature, this confirmed by spectral analysis  , though at high powers into 4 ohms the third harmonic became the highest in level in the left channel  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, the Luxman produced relatively low levels of intermodulation distortion, even at high powers into low impedances  , with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –100dB  , and the higher-order products at or below –80dB  .Fig.8 Luxman L-509X, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0038% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Luxman L-509X, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Luxman L-509X, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Luxman L-509X, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .The Luxman L-509Xs phono input offers two modes, for moving-magnet and moving-coil cartridges. Both modes preserved absolute polarity. The gain in MM mode was 79.5dB, measured at the speaker terminals with the volume control set to its maximum, and 35.6dB when measured at the Rec Out jacks. In MC mode, the gain was 53.1dB, again measured at the Rec Out jacks. The MM input impedance was 45k ohms at low and middle frequencies, 37k ohms at 20kHz. The MC mode impedance was a constant 100 ohms across the audioband.The RIAA error was low, with a slight, +0.4dB bump in the midrange  . However, the left channel   has a slight boost in the top audio octaves. Noise levels were low, and in MM mode, the unweighted, wideband S/N ratio was an excellent 69dB ref. 1kHz at 5mV, this improving to 90.6dB when A-weighted. In MC mode, the unweighted, wideband S/N ratio was a still-good 65dB. Phono overload margins were excellent, at 25dB across the audioband in MM mode, 30dB in MC mode. Harmonic and intermodulation distortion levels via the phono input were also superbly low  .Fig.12 Luxman L-509X, phono input, MM mode, RIAA error at 5mV input  .Fig.13 Luxman L-509X, phono input, MM mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 5mV input  .Fig.14 Luxman L-509X, phono input, MM mode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 5mV peak input  Its measured performance indicates that Luxmans L-509X integrated amplifier is a conservatively engineered design, with low noise and distortion and an excellent phono stage.

       " '  Performance Centaur Monos   for an hour at one-third its specified maximum power of 500W into 8 ohms, thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. The amplifier was too heavy for me to lift it onto my test bench so it sat on the carpeted floor, with some clearance given by supporting it on Black Diamond cones. By the end of the hour, the top panel was warm, at 105°F  , and the side-mounted heatsinks were warmer, at 114.5°F  . With the amplifier cold, the THD+N at one-third power was 0.0329%. By the end of the hour, it had dropped to 0.0307%.  on serial number 1101131901 using Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system   connected to the Centaurs balanced input. I repeated some of the tests using the unbalanced input, but did not test the amplifier via its Direct input, which is intended for use only with Constellation preamplifiers.The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was a little lower than average, at 25.8dB, but close to the specified 26dB. It was the same for both balanced and unbalanced drive, and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The Centaurs input impedance is specified as a very high 100k ohms unbalanced and 200k ohms balanced, but my measurements were very much lower: 9.6k ohms unbalanced and 19k ohms balanced.The output impedance was low for a bridged design, at 0.07 ohm including the cable at low and middle frequencies, rising slightly to just under 0.1 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the modification of the Centaurs frequency response by the interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker   was less than ±0.1dB. However, this graph reveals that the Centaurs ultrasonic behavior depends on the load impedance. With the highest impedance I tried, 16 ohms  , the output rose by 0.8dB at 200kHz. The rise was 0.3dB into 8 ohms  , and into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms   the response increasingly rolled off above the audioband. Perhaps correlating with this rise at 200kHz, while the Centaurs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave had very short risetimes  , there was also a very small amount of overshoot visible, with one damped cycle of ringing at a very high ultrasonic frequency. The 1kHz squarewave reproduction   was essentially perfect.Fig.1 Constellation Performance Centaur, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Constellation Performance Centaur, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Although MF noted that the Centaur was very quiet, the amplifiers wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio  , taken with the balanced input shorted, was slightly disappointing at 72.1dB, though it did improve to 81.2dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the amplifiers low-frequency noise floor while it reproduced a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms   indicated that the residual full-wave rectified power-supply component at 120Hz lay at –83dB  , with the 240Hz harmonic at –87dB. The magnetically sourced component at 60Hz lay at –93dB, and all the other supply-related components lay at or below –95dB. I repeated the spectral analysis with the other sample of the Centaur, S/N 1101131902. The spectrum of this amplifiers noisefloor   was very similar to that of the first sample  , but the odd harmonics of the 60Hz AC frequency were a little higher in level.Fig.3 Constellation Performance Centaur, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, samples 1101130901   and 1101131902    .Fig.4, which plots the percentage of THD+noise against output power into 8 ohms, indicates that the Centaur slightly exceeds its specified 500W into this load, clipping   at 520W  . The minimum THD+N is very low, at 0.0033%; the downward slope of the trace below 20W in this graph reveals that the distortion is actually below the noise floor at low powers.   The picture was similar into 4 ohms  , with the clipping power of 830W   slightly greater than the specified 800W. The minimum THD+N was higher, however, at 0.0061% between 10 and 20W. The distortion was higher still into 2 ohms  , with the amplifier clipping at 1210W  , which is 0.8dB above the specified 1kW into this load. However, although I switched off the signal generator as soon as the Centaur clipped into 2 ohms, the amplifier wouldnt pass a signal after this test. Obviously, I had broken something.  Fig.4 Constellation Performance Centaur, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Constellation Performance Centaur, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Constellation Performance Centaur, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Before this test, I plotted how the THD+N varied with frequency at a level, 18V, where I could be sure that I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise. The results are shown in  .7. The THD rises slightly at the top of the audioband, but is very low into both 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  . The amplifier is less comfortable with 2 ohms  , however. Again, to be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise,  waveform of the THD+N residue at a high level, 50W into 8 ohms  . The distortion at this level was 0.005% and was predominantly third harmonic in nature. Even at high power, 200W, into 4 ohms  , the subjectively innocuous third harmonic remained the highest in level, at –72dB  , with the second harmonic at –90dB   and all other harmonics and power-supply–related components at or below –100dB. Intermodulation distortion at high power into 4 ohms was also extremely low  .Fig.7 Constellation Performance Centaur, THD+N   vs frequency at 18V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Constellation Performance Centaur, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.005% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Constellation Performance Centaur, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Constellation Performance Centaur, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 8 ohms  .Constellation Audios Performance Centaur Mono is a powerhouse of an amplifier capable of delivering very high power with very low distortion into 4 and 8 ohms. While it was less comfortable with 2 ohms, it will have no problem driving low-impedance speakers with aplomb. Although I broke it with sustained delivery exceeding 1kW into 2 ohms  , there isnt a speaker made that would not be the first to expire at this power level! Color me impressed. Footnote 1: When he received the amplifier back after the review had been published, Peter Madnick let me know that an internal fuse had blown, that the amplifier wasnt damaged.          ',\n",
       " '  hefty Ovation MA8.2 monoblock    .   of a power amplifier, I precondition it by running it at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes.   After an hour driving 200W into 8 ohms, the temperature of the MA8.2s heatsinks was a moderate 125°F  , and its the top panel was warm, at 107.8°F  . The front-panel meter was accurately calibrated, reporting as \"199.6W\" an actual level of 198.8W into 8 ohms.The voltage gain into 8 ohms for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs was 29dB, and both inputs preserved absolute polarity, the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance was slightly lower than the specified  ures, at 9k ohms unbalanced and 14k ohms balanced, both values consistent from 20Hz to 20kHz. The output impedance   was very low, at 0.08 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising very slightly to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by just ±0.05dB  . This graph, taken with a balanced input  , shows that the audioband response is flat into 8 ohms  , with the ultrasonic rolloff reaching –0.5dB at a very high 100kHz. The response rolled off earlier into lower impedances, reaching –1.8dB at 100kHz into 2 ohms  , but was still flat up to the top of the audioband. The AVMs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was therefore excellent  , with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 AVM MA8.2, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 AVM MA8.2, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.With those massive toroidal transformers close to the audio circuitry, I was not surprised to find in the MA8.2s output some supply-related artifacts at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics  . These will be due to magnetic interference, but its fair to note that although theyre visible in this graph, they all lie at or below –100dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. The wideband signal/noise ratio ref. 1W into 8 ohms, taken with the input shorted to ground, was okay, at 74.6dB, but this improved to 82.9dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 84.3dB when A-weighted.Fig.3 AVM MA8.2, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The AVM amplifier is rated to produce >600W into 8 ohms. Fig.4 shows that it didnt actually clip   until 805W  , at which power output the AC wall voltage in my test lab measured 121.1V. The downward slope of the trace below 100W into 8 ohms in this graph indicates that the actual distortion lay below the noise floor at powers less than 100W. Into 4 ohms  , the MA8.2 clipped at 1320W  ; into 2 ohms, it clipped at 1820W  , even though at this power output the wall voltage had dropped to 115.8V.Fig.4 AVM MA8.2, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 AVM MA8.2, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I measured how the percentage of THD+N varied with frequency at 28.3V output, which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms, 200W into 4 ohms, and 400W into 2 ohms. The results are shown in  .6: The distortion is very low overall, but does rise into 4 and 2 ohms and in the top octaves and, to my surprise, below 50Hz. The distortion is primarily the third harmonic  , and, even at a very high power into 4 ohms  , doesnt rise above –90dB  . However, you can see in this graph the low-level, supply-related spuriae, which also appeared when I tested for intermodulation distortion  . But note how low are the actual intermodulation products in  .9, despite the very high power. The high-order products are all at or below –96dB  , and the second-order, difference product at 1kHz cant be seen at all above the level of the low-frequency supply spuriae.Fig.6 AVM MA8.2, THD+N   vs frequency at 28.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 AVM MA8.2, 1kHz waveform at 200W into 8 ohms, 0.0013% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 AVM MA8.2, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–20kHz, at 400W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 AVM MA8.2, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 400W peak into 8 ohms  .After having had some, shall I say, \"idiosyncratically engineered\" amplifiers pass through my test lab in recent months, it was a pleasure to measure such a well-engineered, conservatively specified amplifier as AVMs Ovation MA8.2.           ',\n",
       " '  HiFi Rose RA180—serial number ESL203AB000182—from the one auditioned by Julie Mullins. I performed the measurements  , examining the amplifiers performance in both normal mode and in bridged   mode, following the instructions in the excellent manual. As Julie Mullins found, the RA180 doesnt recognize 5G Wi-Fi networks, but I was able to connect it to my Netgear NightHawk routers 2.4GHz network. I could control the RA180 with the RoseAMPConnect app on my iPhone, as well as with the remote control and the front-panel controls.As the RA180s output stages operate in class-D, all the measurements other than frequency and RIAA responses were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which reduces the level of noise above 80kHz and eliminates noise above 200kHz. Without the filter, in normal mode, a very high 1.33V of ultrasonic noise was present at each pair of loudspeaker terminals, with a center frequency of 525kHz. The ultrasonic noise level rose to 1.6V in bridged mode. In both modes, when amplifying an input signal, the RA180 interfered with the reception of a portable FM radio that lives in the test lab.I dont precondition class-D amplifiers before testing, but the top panel became warm after a few hours, its temperature measuring 104.6°F/40.4°C.The RA180 preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, from both its balanced and single-ended line inputs in both normal and bridged modes. The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms with the line inputs was 26dB, balanced, and 32dB, single-ended, in normal mode, and 6dB higher for both inputs in bridged mode. The balanced input impedance is specified as 44k ohms. I measured 43k ohms at all audio frequencies. The unbalanced input impedance measured 44.3k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping inconsequentially to 29k ohms at 20kHz, compared with the specified 47k ohms.The source impedance in normal mode, including the series resistance of 6 of speaker cable, was a low 0.1 ohms at low and midrange frequencies, rising to 0.4 ohms at the top of the audioband. The variation in the HiFi Rose amplifiers small-signal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was a negligible ±0.1dB. Into 8 ohms  , the RA180s response rose above the audioband, reaching +1.2dB at 65kHz, before sharply rolling off, reaching –3dB just above 100kHz. This peak is associated with a degree of overshoot in the RA180s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  , but there was no ringing. Into lower impedances the response starts to roll off in the top audio octave, with the most extreme result being into 2 ohms  , where the output at 20kHz is down by 2dB.Fig.1 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The source impedance in bridged mode was higher, at 0.15 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, 1 ohm at 20kHz, doubling the variations in response with the simulated loudspeaker   and increasing the 20kHz rolloff into 2 ohms to –4dB. However, overshoot was now minimal in the bridged modes reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.  Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum, and the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings. However, a peculiar 1dB boost in the midrange and bass appeared at lower settings of the volume control  . This behavior was consistent with balanced and single-ended inputs in both output modes. The cyan and magenta traces in  .3 show the action of the Subsonic setting. The main outputs roll off rapidly below 100Hz, reaching –9dB at 40Hz. This rolloff seems too extreme for typical listening, so perhaps it could be used when adding a subwoofer to the system. However, there is no means of altering either the high-pass filters frequency or its slope.Fig.3 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with volume control set to the maximum   and with subsonic filter activated  , and with volume control set to –20dB    .The behavior of the bass and treble tone controls set to their maximum and minimum settings is shown in  .4. Some overlap in their passbands can be seen in this graph, and the maximum cut or boost is higher than useful, at ±15dB in the treble and ±17.5dB in the bass. The Active Crossover controls adjust the turnover frequency level of the secondary amplifier outputs, which can be used to drive supertweeters. Fig.5 shows the behavior of this output with the frequency set to \"0.85\" and \"2.17.\" The controls numerical values approximately coincide with the high-pass filters –3dB frequency.Fig.4 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with bass and treble controls set to the maximum, center, and minimum positions    .Fig.5 HiFi Rose RA180, supertweeter output, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with turnover frequency set to 0.85kHz   and 2.17kHz    The RA180s channel separation   was 80dB in both directions below 2kHz, but the reading, taken with the Audio Precision low-pass filter, was affected by the presence of residual ultrasonic noise. This noise, which had a level of 1.5mV and a center frequency of 45kHz, is equivalent to an unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio in normal mode   of 66dB  . This ratio improved to 80dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 83.6dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the HiFi Rose in normal mode drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum   revealed a higher level of random noise in the left channel   than the right  . Repeating the measurements with the volume control set to –20dB reduced the left channels noisefloor by 6dB   but the right channels floor by 2dB  . In bridged mode  , the levels of the low-frequency random noise in both channels increased by approximately 8dB.Fig.6 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to the maximum   and to –20dB    .HiFi Rose specifies the RA180s maximum power in normal mode as 200Wpc into both 8 and 4 ohms, respectively equivalent to 23dBW and 20dBW. With our usual definition of clipping as being when the THD+noise reaches 1%, the HiFi Rose amplifier with two channels driven in normal mode exceeded its specified powers. It clipped at 290Wpc into 8 ohms   and 400Wpc into 4 ohms  . In bridged mode with again two channels operating, the RA180 went into protection below the actual clipping point, turning off at 460Wpc into 8 ohms   and 322W into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, left channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.8 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, left channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.9 HiFi Rose RA180, bridged mode, left channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.The downward slope below 50W in  s.7–9 indicates that the measured THD+N percentage is dominated by noise.   Fig.10 shows how the percentage of THD+N varied with frequency in normal mode at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms   and 100W into 4 ohms  . The THD+N was very low in the bass and midrange, particularly in the right channel, but rose in the top audio octaves. In bridged mode, the performance into 8 ohms was similar to the normal modes behavior into 4 ohms.Fig.10 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  .Fig.11 shows the distortion waveform in normal mode with a 1kHz sinewave at 50W into 8 ohms. The presence of bursts of switching noise at the waveform peaks makes interpretation difficult, though it looks as if the second harmonic is dominant. This was confirmed by spectral analysis  , though the third harmonic was almost as high in level. Repeating the analysis at the same power in bridged mode   revealed that all the distortion harmonics were lower in level than they had been in normal mode, the third harmonic in particular.Fig.11 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.02% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 HiFi Rose RA180, bridged mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Intermodulation distortion was low in level. With the RA180 driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms in normal mode  , which will be equivalent to 50Wpc into 8 ohms in bridged mode, the 1kHz difference product lay close to –110dB in both channels  , and while the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were higher in level, they still lay below –80dB  .Fig.14 HiFi Rose RA180, normal mode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the phono inputs performance, this preserved absolute polarity in both MM and MC modes. The maximum gain measured at the loudspeaker outputs in normal mode was 78.4dB, MM, and 98.3dB, MC. Bridged mode increased both gains by 6dB. The input impedance, specified as 47k ohms, was 44k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, in both MM and MC modes, but dropped to 6.7k ohms at 20kHz, again in both modes.  phono inputs adjustable equalization set to \"RIAA\" and the output measured at the speaker outputs without the Audio Precision low-pass filter. The error in the RA180s RIAA equalization   was very low, with superb channel matching. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; at lower settings the midrange and bass were boosted by 1dB, as they had been for the line inputs. Assessed with the inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, the phono inputs unweighted, wideband S/N ratios in MM mode were 72.3dB ref. 1kHz at 5mV in both channels. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased this ratio to 74.1dB, while switching in an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 80.6dB. The ratios in MC mode, ref. 1kHz at 0.5mV, were all 20dB lower, correlating with the 20dB increased gain in this mode, but the HiFi Roses phono stage is still relatively quiet.Fig.15 HiFi Rose RA180, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .The phono inputs overload margins were respectable in both modes, at 13dB at 20Hz and 1kHz, ref. 1kHz at 5mV   and at 0.5V  . However, the overload margin at 20kHz was disappointing, at –5dB, again ref. 1kHz at 5mV/0.5mV. In MM mode, an input signal at 20kHz reached 1% THD+N at 28mV, which will be marginal with normal-output moving magnet cartridges.   Harmonic distortion was very low via the phono input, the second and third harmonics with a 1kHz tone at 10mV respectively lying at –94dB   and –100dB   and all other harmonics at –110dB  . And even at a peak level of 25mV, just below the MM modes overload point, an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones produced a 1kHz difference product at –74dB  , with higher-order intermodulation products at negligible levels.The HiFi Rose RA180 offers high powers in both its normal and bridged modes, especially into 4 ohms, with low, mainly benign second-harmonic distortion. I remain puzzled, however, by that 1dB boost in the midrange and bass at low volume control settings, by the higher-than-usual level of ultrasonic noise at the loudspeaker outputs, and by the phono inputs limited overload margin at the top of the audioband.

       " 'As Bel Canto Designs Black is a complex product—both the ASC1 control unit and MPS1 monoblocks have both digital and analog inputs—I performed most of my measurements with the control unit and amplifiers connected with the ST-optical datalinks, with checks of the analog inputs of the amplifiers.   Black using the digital and analog outputs of my   system  , and my 2012 MacBook Pro running on battery power to feed the USB input. Because the MPS1 is a class-D design, I used an Audio Precision AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter ahead of the analyzer, which eliminates noise above 200kHz.   After an hour of running at moderate power levels into 8 ohms, the chassis of the two MPS1s were warm to the touch, at 94.6°F  .I didnt test the Ethernet input but all the ASC1s other digital inputs locked to data with sample rates ranging from 44.1 to 192kHz. Apples USB Prober utility identified the Black as \"Bel Canto uLinkUSB 2.0 Audio Out,\" and confirmed that the USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. Measured at the MPS1s speaker terminals, the ASC1s digital inputs preserved absolute polarity; and with the volume control set to \"100,\" data with a level of –20dBFS gave rise to an analog signal of 12.08V RMS into 8 ohms. This suggests that the volume control shouldnt be used above \"94\" to avoid clipping the amplifiers. The control itself operated in accurate 0.5dB steps.The Blacks reconstruction filter offers three different rolloffs, as well as a setting called Filter Off. Fig.1 shows the impulse response at a sample rate of 44.1kHz with Filter Off; this is a conventional, linear-phase, half-band impulse response, with the ringing symmetrically placed around the single sample at 0dBFS. By contrast, Filters 1–3 offer minimum-phase impulse responses, with   all the ringing following the high sample and the amount of ringing decreasing as the number of the filter increases. Fig.2, for example, shows the impulse response of Filter 2.Fig.1 Bel Canto Black, digital input, Filter Off, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.2 Bel Canto Black, digital input, Filter 2, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .White noise sampled at 44.1kHz reveals that the Filter Off filter has the usual fast rolloff above the audioband  , with a small rise in the ultrasonic noise floor centered on 65kHz  . Bel Canto claims that Filters 1–3 are \"apodizing\" types, meaning that they eliminate ringing at half the sample rate. The red and magenta traces in  .4 show the Blacks output with Filter 1 selected. You can see that it is indeed an apodizing type by the sharply defined null at exactly half the sample rate  . Filters 2 and 3 are identical other than the fact that the rolloff starts a little earlier and the height of the lobe in the stopband above the green line is lower in amplitude. The blue and cyan traces in these graphs are the output with a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz; all four filters completely suppress the ultrasonic image at 25kHz, and the distortion harmonics are all at or below –76dB  .Fig.3 Bel Canto Black, digital input, Filter Off, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.4 Bel Canto Black, digital input, Filter 1, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.5 is a more conventional way of showing digital frequency response, with Filter 1 and sample rates of 44.1, 96, and 192kHz. The overall shape of the response is the same at all three rates, with, as expected, a sharp rolloff at 20kHz at 44.1kHz. But the ultrasonic rolloff occurs a little earlier with the higher rate. With 192kHz data, for example, the output is down by 9dB at 52kHz rather than at the expected 90kHz or so. This measurement was taken at the speaker terminals, so it includes the contribution of the class-D modules and, of course, the Audio Precision low-pass filter. However, repeating the measurements without the AP filter or with an analog input to the MPS1 gave the same result. The class-D stage has, of necessity, a curtailed ultrasonic response, due to the fact that it cannot have an infinitely high switching frequency; so while the full bandwidth extension offered by high sample rates cant be realized with the Black, it looks as if Bel Cantos design team has achieved a careful balance of what is possible. Filters 2 and 3 offer earlier rolloffs with 44.1kHz data, trading off the slight loss of top-octave response against the better time-domain behavior of these filters.Fig.5 Bel Canto Black, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .To test the resolution of the Blacks digital inputs, I set the volume control to \"90,\" equivalent to an output power of 165W into 8 ohms. Under this condition, increasing the bit depth from 16 to 24 with dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS dropped the noise floor by 23dB  , which is equivalent to a resolution of almost 20 bits: superb performance. Referenced to the Blacks specified clipping power, this would increase to 21 bits, though I didnt test that due to my concern that I might inadvertently break the amplifier before I finished the measurements. This graph was taken with AES/EBU data; repeating the test with USB data gave the same result, indicating that the USB input correctly handles 24-bit data. With its superb low-level linearity and low noise, the Bel Canto had no problem dealing with an undithered 16-bit tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  . The data describe three DC voltage levels; these were clearly evident, and the waveform was nicely symmetrical about the time axis. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a clean sinewave relatively free of noise  .Fig.6 Bel Canto Black, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.7 Bel Canto Black, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.8 Bel Canto Black, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Tested for its rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit J-Test data  , the Black produced no visible jitter-related sidebands, and the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were all close to the correct levels  . This graph was taken with AES/EBU data; USB data gave an identical result, and with 24-bit data, the noise floor was clean and free from spuriae  .Fig.9 Bel Canto Black, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data from SYS2722 via AES/EBU  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.10 Bel Canto Black, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit data from SYS2722 via AES/EBU  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Turning to the Bel Canto Blacks performance with analog signals, these are digitized by the ASC1. As the ASC1 has AES/EBU outputs as well as the ST-optical outputs to feed the MPS1s, I could examine the efficacy of its digitization by looking at the digital data directly. The ASC1s A/D converter operates at a sample rate of 192kHz and a 24-bit word length. The maximum volume control setting was \"110,\" with settings above \"100\" applying gain in the digital domain. At this setting, it took an 830mV signal at 1kHz to reach –0.1dBFS. Reducing the volume appears to increase the digital headroom. Fig.11 shows the ASC1s analog-input frequency response, measured in the digital domain. The output is down by 3dB at 53kHz, the fairly slow rolloff suggesting good time-domain behavior.Fig.11 Bel Canto ASC1, analog input, A/D frequency response    .The ASC1s single-ended analog input impedance was 9k ohms at all audio frequencies, this a little on the low side for use with tubed source components. The MPS1s balanced analog input impedance was 18k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to 2300 ohms at 20kHz. Both components analog inputs preserved absolute polarity   at the factory default setting. The MPS1s audioband output impedance was very low, at 0.09 ohm  . As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was minuscule  . The data plotted in this graph indicate that the MPS1s response is down by 1dB at 20kHz, –3dB at 31kHz, and –9dB at 50kHz. This ultrasonic rolloff was the same driving the ASC1s analog input and measuring at the MPS1s speaker terminal, nor did it change with different settings of the ASC1s volume control.Fig.12 Bel Canto MPS1, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.13 shows the Blacks reproduction of a small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms. The tops and bottoms of the waveform are obscured by the ultrasonic switching noise generated by the class-D output stage. Repeating the measurement with the Audio Precision low-pass filter ahead of the analyzer gave the well-shaped waveform in  .14. I suspect that the small amount of overshoot and ultrasonic ringing is due to the ASC1s A/D converter. A 10kHz squarewave   was reproduced with just one cycle of ringing, and lengthened risetimes associated with the ultrasonic rolloff seen in  .12. Even with the Audio Precision filters rolloff, there is enough leakage of the output stages switching noise to interfere with both the unweighted wideband and audioband signal/noise ratios. The A-weighted S/N ratio of the MPS1 alone, taken with the analog input shorted to ground and ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms, was 79.2dB; that of the complete Black with its analog input shorted but its volume control set to \"110\" was 60.2dB. Channel separation, measured at the ASC1s analog inputs, was >100dB below 2kHz, and still 70dB in both directions at 20kHz.Fig.13 Bel Canto Black, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.14 Bel Canto Black, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision low-pass filter.Fig.15 Bel Canto Black, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision low-pass filter.  MPS1s clipping power by driving it directly, to avoid the possibility of overdriving the ASC1s analog input A/D converter and confusing the result. The Black is specified as delivering 300W into 8 ohms, 600W into 4 ohms, or 1200W into 2 ohms, all equivalent to 24.8dBW. However, in this continuously driven condition, the amplifiers protection circuit operated at a level 3dB below the specified maximum power. This can be seen in  s. 16 and 17, which respectively plot the THD+noise percentage against output power into 8 and 4 ohms. The traces stop at 149.5W into 8 ohms   at 0.00223% THD+N, and at 293W into 4 ohms   at 0.002%, which in both cases was where the protection circuit went into action. Into 2 ohms  , the protection cut in at 545W  , at 0.015%.Fig.16 Bel Canto Black, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.17 Bel Canto Black, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.But below the continuous powers where the protection operated the MPS1 offered very low distortion. The lower trace in  .18 shows the distortion+noise waveform at 59W into 4 ohms. I had to average 64 captures to reduce the noise to the point where the distortion waveform emerged from the higher-level noise; it is primarily third-harmonic in nature. This was with the review unit designated as the left channel. As can be seen in  .19, the other sample   had just a trace of second-harmonic distortion. Intermodulation distortion at a fairly high power was also very low  , the 1kHz difference component resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at –96dB  .Fig.18 Bel Canto Black, 1kHz waveform at 59W into 4 ohms, 0.005% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.19 Bel Canto Black, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 86W into 4 ohms  .Fig.20 Bel Canto Black, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 86W peak into 4 ohms  .Overall, I was very impressed by the Bel Canto Black, especially with its behavior as a D/A converter that is effectively capable of driving loudspeakers. Once I have finished the review of another amplifier I have been working on, I am going to set up the Black in my own system for a listen. Footnote 1: This test was suggested to me by Jürgen Reis of MBL.          ',\n",
       " '  Hegel H160 using my recently recalibrated   system  .   on an amplifier, I run it for an hour at one-third its specified maximum power, which, thermally, is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. I cut short this preconditioning of the H160 after 20 minutes, however, as the THD+noise, which had been just 0.00315% with the amplifier cold, had risen to 0.83%. The chassis was mildly warm, at 92.2°F  , but the temperature of the internal heatsinks must have been much higher. Allowing the amplifier to cool brought back correct operation, with very low distortion, but this is not an amplifier suitable for sustained high-power use, such as providing the music for a rambunctious party.The volume control offers 99 steps, with \"0\" being full mute, activated by a relay. However, only alternate settings offered a reduction in gain; eg, both \"99\" and \"98\" offered maximum gain, \"97\" and \"96\" produced a reduction in level of –1dB, \"95\" and \"94\" a reduction of –2dB, and so on. The maximum voltage gain, measured at the speaker terminals, was a modest 31.6dB into 8 ohms for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs, while the fixed-gain, line-level outputs offered unity gain, with a source impedance of 1k ohms across the audioband. All outputs preserved absolute polarity  . The unbalanced input impedance was a usefully high 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, this dropping inconsequentially to 34k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance, however, was on the low side, at 9.4k ohms, at all audio frequencies.The output impedance was very low over most of the audioband, at 0.07 ohm, rising to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz.   As a result, the modulation of the H160s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was minimal. The Hegel offers a wide small-signal bandwidth, its output into 8 ohms being down by 3dB at greater than the 200kHz limit of this graph, which resulted in a superbly accurate shape to a 10kHz squarewave, with very short risetimes and no sign of overshoot or ringing  . The traces in  .1 were taken with the balanced input and the volume control set to its maximum. Commendably, there was no change in the frequency response and channel balance for different settings of the volume control, or with the unbalanced inputs.Fig.1 Hegel H160, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Hegel H160, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was good rather than great, at >80dB below 2kHz but 60dB at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted but the volume control set to its maximum—very much the worst-case situation—was good, at 76.3dB in the left channel and 77.5dB in the right, ref. 1W into 8 ohms, these respectively improving to 92.7 and 91.3dB when A-weighted. The primary source of noise was the presence of power-supply–related components at the even- and odd-order harmonics of 60Hz, though all of these lay at or below –94dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.3 Hegel H160, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Specified to produce 150Wpc into 8 ohms   or 250Wpc into 4 ohms  , the H160 clipped   at 175Wpc into 8 ohms   and 270Wpc into 4 ohms  . The down-sloping shape of the traces in these two graphs implies that the actual distortion remains below the noise floor at levels below 50W or so. I therefore measured how the percentage of THD+N changed with frequency at a reasonably high level, 9V, equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms and 20W into 4 ohms. The results are shown in  .6: the right channel   is not quite as linear as the left  , particularly in the top two audio octaves. However, the distortion remains very low across the audioband.Fig.4 Hegel H160, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Hegel H160, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Hegel H160, THD+N   vs frequency at 9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion signature in the midband is predominantly the third harmonic   This graph was taken from the left channels output; the second harmonic was highest in the right channel  , though at –90dB ref. 50W into 8 ohms  , high is not really the appropriate adjective. Intermodulation distortion   was similarly very low.Fig.7 Hegel H160, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 4 ohms, 0.0049% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Hegel H160, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Hegel H160, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .Turning to the H160s digital inputs: With the volume control set to its maximum, digital data at –12dBFS gave rise to a level of 24.5V into 8 ohms   from the speaker outputs, which suggests that the amplifier at full volume will clip with data at –6dBFS. Fortunately, this will never happen outside the test lab, but   digital-domain performance at the fixed-level line outputs with the speaker outputs muted, to avoid overloading the amplifiers output stage. Data at 0dBFS resulted in an analog level of 2.53V at the line-level outputs.I didnt test the H160s AirPlay input. The coaxial and optical S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with sample rates ranging from 44.1 to 192kHz. With the USB input fed data from my MacBook Pro running on battery power, Apples USB Prober utility reported the product string as \"DigiHug USB Audio\" from \"GFEC ASSP,\" though the AudioMIDI utility identified the Hegel as \"TE7022 Audio w/ SPDIF.\" This implies that the H160 uses the Tenor USB receiver chip, which was confirmed by the fact that the Hegels USB input will not accept data sampled at 88.2kHz, though it does accept 96kHz data. USB Prober also indicated that the H160s USB port operates in the isochronous adaptive mode, although, as youll see later, this does not result in compromised jitter rejection.The impulse response with 44.1kHz data   reveals that the H160s digital reconstruction filter is a conventional time-symmetrical type, with a rapid rolloff above the Nyquist frequency for 44.1kHz data, this indicated in  .11 by the vertical green line at 22.05kHz. The red and magenta traces in this graph, taken with 44.1kHz-sampled white noise at –4dBFS, reveal that the rolloff has reached the stopband noise floor by 25kHz, the frequency of the aliasing image of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz  . The harmonics of this 19.1kHz tone are all very low in level. Fig.12 shows a more conventional manner of presenting digital-domain frequency response, with S/PDIF data sampled at 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , and 192kHz  . All three pairs of traces feature a slight rise in response in the top audio octave, reaching +0.75dB at 40kHz with the higher sample rates; peculiarly, the response with 192kHz data is no more extended than with 96kHz data.Fig.10 Hegel H160, line output, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.11 Hegel H160, line output, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.12 Hegel H160, line output, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Channel separation for the digital inputs was >100dB below 600Hz, decreasing to 67dB at 20kHz. Fig.13 reveals that the H160s noise floor drops by up to 18dB when the bit depth is increased from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, which implies resolution of almost 19 bits, which is excellent. However, an odd modulation of the noise floor is evident in the low treble with 24-bit data in this graph  . Nevertheless, the Hegels reproduction of an undithered 16-bit sinewave at exactly –90.31dBFS   was superb, with the three DC voltage levels described by the data readily resolved, while undithered 24-bit data gave a clean sinewave  . Figs. 13 and 14 were taken with S/PDIF data; repeating the tests with USB data gave identical results, though I had to make sure that the bit depth was correctly set to \"24-bit integer\" with the AudioMIDI utility to get the maximum resolution with 24-bit files.Fig.13 Hegel H160, line output, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.14 Hegel H160, line output, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.15 Hegel H160, line output, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Despite its USB input operating in the isochronous adaptive mode, the H160 offered excellent rejection of wordclock jitter via USB, and the S/PDIF inputs were equally good. With 16-bit J-Test data  , all the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were at or close to their correct levels, and no other sidebands were evident around the high-level tone at one-quarter the sample rate. With 24-bit J-Test data  , no sidebands are visible, and the noise floor is clean and free from spuriae.Fig.16 Hegel H160, line output, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data from AP SYS2722 via TosLink  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.17 Hegel H160, line output, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit data from AP SYS2722 via TosLink  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Hegels H160 integrated amplifier is a well-engineered powerhouse, though owners should make sure it is well ventilated if they want to play music at sustained high levels. Its digital/analog circuitry is workmanlike rather than the state of the art, but a standalone digital processor offering better performance than this is going to cost as least as much as the Hegels $3500.           ',\n",
       " '  Luxmans measured behavior, I mainly used Stereophiles loaner sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . , I thermally stress it by running it for 60 minutes at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms, which is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. With its class-A output stage, the Luxman easily survived this ordeal; at the end of the hour its chassis was warm, but not so hot that I couldnt keep my hand on it. In that time the THD+noise had risen from 0.007% to 0.0089%.The M-800As voltage gain into 8 ohms was 28.8dB for the balanced and unbalanced inputs. The unbalanced input preserved absolute polarity  , while the balanced input inverted polarity, due to the XLR jack being wired with pin 3 hot and pin 2 cold, the opposite of the AES standard. At 43k ohms, the unbalanced input impedance was insignificantly lower than specified at low and midrange frequencies, though this did drop slightly at 20kHz, to 32k ohms. The balanced input impedance was to specification at 67k ohms at all frequencies.The Luxmans output impedance was a little higher than usual for a solid-state design, at 0.12 ohm at low and midrange frequencies, rising to 0.16 ohm at the top of the audioband. Even so, any modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between its output impedance and the modulus of our simulated loudspeakers impedance remained within ±0.1dB  . This graph also shows that the amplifiers bandwidth changes only slightly with load impedance, the –3dB point lying at 80kHz into 8 ohms  , and at 60kHz into 2 ohms  . This was for the balanced input; the unbalanced input had a wider bandwidth, the response into 8 ohms lying at 120kHz  . The Luxmans reproduction of a balanced 10kHz squarewave had slightly slowed leading edges  , though there is no sign of overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Luxman M-800A, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Luxman M-800A, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was very good, at 90dB in both directions at 1kHz, though it did decrease to 70dB at the top of the audioband  . The amplifiers wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   was modest, at 52.7dB, though this increased to an excellent 81dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and increased further, to 83.5dB, with an A-weighted measurement.The M-800A is a low-distortion amplifier. Fig.3, for example, plots the THD+N percentage against output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The Luxman is specified as delivering a continuous 60Wpc into 8 ohms   at <0.009% THD+N  . This is not the power at clipping, however; at 1% THD+N  , the M-800A delivered no less than 160Wpc into 8 ohms   and 280Wpc into 4 ohms  , both  ures measured with both channels driven. And while the rise in distortion above 50W in  .3 shows that the amplifier is clearly working harder than it probably likes to into 2 ohms, it still manages to deliver 480W into that load   at 1% THD+N with one channel driven.Fig.3 Luxman M-800A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.4 plots the THD+N percentage present in the Luxmans output as it drives 8 and 4 ohm loads at an output voltage of 10V, the level where  .3 indicates that the THD components begin to rise out of the noise floor. The high-frequency rise in THD above the very low level in the midrange and bass is due to the circuits diminishing open-loop bandwidth—there is less gain margin available for the negative feedback loop to do its distortion-reducing thing. Neither channel behaves appreciably differently as the load impedance is reduced from 8 ohms   to 4 ohms  . However, this plot was taken with the amplifier cold. Once it had warmed up, the midband distortion rose by a factor of four into 4 ohms. Though the absolute level of the THD was still low, this behavior was a little alarming, as looking at the oscilloscope display, the rise in THD into low impedances appeared to be due to a small burst of ultrasonic noise appearing on every positive peak of the waveform.Fig.4 Luxman M-800A, THD+N   vs frequency at 8V into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  .I repeated the measurement once the amplifier had cooled down, and it behaved perfectly again. And again, once it had heated up, the ultrasonic noise appeared if I used the M-800A to drive loads of 4 ohms or lower. However, now the M-800A wouldnt drive 2 ohms without instability developing. I checked my cables, replaced my dummy load with another, and repeated the measurement using the Audio Precision System One rather than the SYS2722. There was no change in the amplifiers apparent unhappiness at driving low impedances once it had warmed up.The main distortion component with the Luxman driving higher impedances was the subjectively benign second harmonic  . However, the left channel also offered some third harmonic  , though its fair to note that both the second and third harmonics lie at very low levels, and that no higher-order harmonics are present in this graph. However, a regular series of spuriae can also be seen at odd multiples of the AC mains frequency of 60Hz  , particularly in the right channel. All of these are at or below –105dB, and so will be inaudible, but they do suggest the presence of magnetic coupling between the M-800As power-supply transformer and the audio circuitry. Dropping the load to 4 ohms   doesnt affect the level of the AC spuriae but does increase the level of the harmonics, particularly in the left channel  , and the noise floor rises, due to the bursts of noise accompanying the positive waveform peaks that I mentioned earlier affecting the measurement.Fig.5 Luxman M-800A, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms  , 0.0056% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Luxman M-800A, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 34W into 8 ohms  .Fig.7 Luxman M-800A, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 65W into 4 ohms  .Finally, the M-800As decreasing linearity at high frequencies leads to the appearance of some intermodulation products with the demanding 19+20kHz signal  , though these are still at a low level in absolute terms.Fig.8 Luxman M-800A, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 30W peak into 8 ohms  .Overall, the Luxman M-800A performed well on the test bench. However, given how well Michael Fremer found the amplifier to perform with his Wilson MAXX 2s, I do wonder if our review sample had developed a possibly atypical problem regarding its relative misbehavior into lower impedances once it had warmed up. Footnote 1: Although it doesnt say so in the M-800As literature, I suspect that this is the maximum power the amplifier will deliver in full class-A. At higher powers, the output stage progressively transitions into class-B operation until the amplifier eventually reaches its output voltage limit.          ',\n",
       " '  Marantz PM5003s measured behavior using Stereophiles loan sample of the   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. , I run it for 60 minutes at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms. Thermally, this is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. At the end of this period, the Marantzs case was warm to the touch and the grille above its internal heatsink was too hot to touch. Even so, the amplifiers heatsinking is adequate for its power level.Looking first at the moving-magnet phono input, this offered an appropriate 38.5dB of gain, measured at the Tape Out jacks, and preserved absolute polarity  . The input impedance was 48k ohms over most of the audioband, dropping slightly to 40k ohms at 20kHz. The RIAA correction, again measured at the Tape Out jacks, was superbly flat in the right channel  , but less good in the left  , with a –0.26dB shelf in the treble, presumably due to a slightly out-of-tolerance resistor or capacitor. The wideband signal/noise ratio   was a good 57dB, this increasing to 81.2dB when A-weighted, which is only just below specification. The phono amplifier had excellent overload characteristics, offering 27dB of margin at all frequencies.Fig.1 Marantz PM5003, RIAA error of MM phono input  .The Marantzs line inputs can be operated with the tone controls in-circuit or bypassed; Marantz calls the latter mode Source Direct. The maximum voltage gain was the same in both modes of operation, at 37.9dB into 8 ohms, and both modes were non-inverting. The input impedance was the same in both modes, at 24k ohms across the audioband, which is insignificantly higher than the specified  ure of 20k ohms.The PM5003s output impedance was fairly low, at 0.1 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising inconsequentially to 0.12 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker   held to within limits of ±0.15dB. However, this graph also shows a 0.3dB channel imbalance in favor of the right channel  . The volume control was set to 2:00 for these measurements; rotating the control clockwise to its maximum setting reduced the imbalance to 0.1dB, now in favor of the left channel.Fig.2 Marantz PM5003, Source Direct frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  The set of curves in  .2 was taken in Source Direct mode  , yet a slight   boost can be seen in the upper midrange that will be just audible. The amplifier performed identically with the tone controls in-circuit but set to their detented, flat positions, so this behavior is not due to residual tone-control equalization. The PM5003 has a wide small-signal bandwidth in Source Direct mode, with a –3dB point of 140kHz, which correlates with a well-shaped 10kHz squarewave response  . However, setting the volume control to its maximum position increased the upper –3dB point to well above 200kHz, while switching in the tone controls reduced this to 110kHz, and gave a very slightly earlier low-frequency rolloff  .Fig.3 Marantz PM5003, Source Direct small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.4 shows the effect of the treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum positions, as well as to their central detented positions.   The maximum treble boost and cut was ±10dB at 15kHz, and the bass  ures were ±11dB at 75Hz; both sets are appropriately modest. Channel separation at 1kHz was good at 90dB L–R and 80dB R–L, but it decreased to 70dB in both directions at 100Hz, and to 62dB L–R and 56dB R–L at 20kHz, the latter due to the usual capacitive coupling. The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio   was the same in both tone-control and Source Direct modes, at 68dB. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved the ratio to an excellent 86.5dB, which is basically to specification.Fig.4 Marantz PM5003, frequency response at 1V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to maximum and minimum positions  .With both channels active, the Marantz PM5003 met its specified maximum output powers of 40Wpc into 8 ohms   and 55Wpc into 4 ohms  . At clipping  , the PM5003 delivered 42Wpc into 8 ohms   and 58Wpc into 4 ohms  .   Fig.5 shows how the THD+noise percentage in the amplifiers output changed with output power into 8 and 4 ohms; the downward slope of the traces below 20–30W suggests that the actual distortion present was below the noise floor, and the onset of actual waveform clipping is quite sudden. This graph was taken with the tone controls in-circuit but set to their flat positions. Though the clipping power was identical into both loads, to my surprise the amplifier behaved quite differently at lower powers in Source Direct mode  . The THD+N is the same as in  .6, until 1.3W into 8 ohms and 2.6W into 4 ohms  , when there is a sudden, drastic rise in THD to just over 0.3%. This then drops a little before the amplifier reaches its actual clipping point.Fig.5 Marantz PM5003, tone controls in-circuit but set to flat, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4 ohms.Fig.6 Marantz PM5003, Source Direct, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4 ohms.Fig.7 Marantz PM5003, tone controls in-circuit but set to flat, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .This disparity between the two modes can also be seen in the graphs plotting THD+N against frequency at 2.83V  . With the tone controls operating  , the THD is below the noise at frequencies below 1.5kHz or so, as predicted from  .5; it does rise at higher frequencies due to the usual decrease in open-loop bandwidth, though this is not to any significant level, even into lower impedances. In Source Direct mode  , however, the distortion remains quite high over most of the audioband and comprises many low-order harmonics  . By contrast, the distortion waveform with tone controls active at the same power level   is mainly second-harmonic in nature, though the spikes at the signals zero-crossing points suggest insufficient bias current for the output-stage transistors.Fig.8 Marantz PM5003, Source Direct, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Marantz PM5003, Source Direct, 1kHz waveform at 5.4W into 8 ohms  , 0.31% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Marantz PM5003, tone controls in-circuit but set to flat, 1kHz waveform at 5.4W into 8 ohms  , 0.007% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .At power close to clipping, the third harmonic becomes the highest in level in tone-control mode  , while the second harmonic is highest in Source Direct  ; although a regular series of higher harmonics can be seen in both modes, these are much higher in level in Source Direct. While the 120Hz power-supply hum component in these two graphs is respectably low in both modes, at –103dB left and –95dB right, the 1kHz fundamental and the harmonics each acquire a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz in Source Direct  . The PM5003 did well in the demanding high-frequency intermodulation test, at a power level just below visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope  . All the intermodulation products were at or below –96dB  . This was with the tone controls active, however. In Source Direct mode at the same power level  , the 1kHz difference component rose from –100dB   to –60dB  .Fig.11 Marantz PM5003, tone controls in-circuit but set to flat, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 27W into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Marantz PM5003, Source Direct, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 27W into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 Marantz PM5003, tone controls in-circuit but set to flat, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 22W peak into 8 ohms  .Bob Reina reports hearing no difference between Source Direct mode and the active but centered tone controls. But its measured performance does indicate that the Marantz PM5003 was not working properly in Source Direct; perhaps something broke in shipping or when I hooked up the amplifier on the testbench, though its odd that both channels were affected. But assuming that the PM5003s measured performance with tone controls active is indicative of its intrinsic performance, it did well for such an inexpensive amplifier. I was worried about the lack of output-stage bias, but the excellent MM phono stage is a bonus.           ',\n",
       " 'After running for one hour at 1/3 power, the Rotel RB-1090s case was quite hot, but not abnormally so. DC offset measured 1.8mV in the left channel, 1.1mV in the right. The amplifier is noninverting, with pin 2 positive in its balanced mode. Voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 28.8dB  . Unless noted otherwise, all   with the amplifier running in unbalanced mode.The RB-1090s input impedance measured 33.2k ohms  . The maximum measured output impedance was 0.16 ohms, at 20kHz into a 4 ohm load, this decreasing to less than 0.1 ohm at 1kHz. This is not unusually low for a solid-state amplifier, but low enough that any effect on the amplifiers frequency response with a real load will be small. The signal/noise readings   were 94dB from 22Hz to 22kHz, 86dB from 10Hz to 500kHz, and 94dB A-weighted. The corresponding balanced values were 82dB, 75dB, and 83dB.The amplifiers frequency response is shown in  .1. Only the small   dip at 5kHz distinguishes the response with a   loudspeaker load from that with pure resistance. The 10kHz squarewave   is as good as any weve seen, with a fast risetime, only a slight rounding of the leading edge  , and no overshoot or ringing. Like the S/N readings, the crosstalk in  .3 is slightly worse in balanced mode, but nevertheless low enough to be audibly irrelevant.Fig.1 Rotel RB-1090, frequency response at  : 2W into 4 ohms, 1W into 8 ohms, and 2.828V into simulated loudspeaker load,  .Fig.2 Rotel RB-1090, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Rotel RB-1090, channel separation vs frequency  : R–L, L–R, balanced; L–R, R–L, unbalanced  .The THD+noise percentage vs frequency behavior is shown in  s.4 and 5. Measured distortion is higher in balanced mode  , but nevertheless still respectably low. The THD waveform in  .6 into 4 ohms indicates a predominant third harmonic, plus noise. Fig.7 shows the distortion spectrum of a 50Hz input signal at an output of 2/3 rated power   into 4 ohms. The only distortion artifact above –80dB   is the third harmonic at 150Hz  . Fig.8 plots the IM distortion of a 19+20kHz waveform at 383W into 4 ohms. Again, only one component is higher than –80dB: the artifact at 18kHz  . The distortion at 2/3 power into 8 ohms   is even lower. These are very fine results.Fig.4 Rotel RB-1090, THD+noise   vs frequency at  : 4W into 2 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, 2.83V into simulated loudspeaker load, and 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.5 Rotel RB-1090, THD+noise   vs frequency at  : 1W into 8 ohms and 2W into 4 ohms, balanced; 2W into 4 ohms and 1W into 8 ohms, unbalanced  .Fig.6 Rotel RB-1090, 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  , distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Rotel RB-1090, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 469W into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Rotel RB-1090, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–22kHz, 19+20kHz at 383W into 4 ohms  .Because the RB-1090 is rated only into a minimum power of 4 ohms, and also to avoid thermal risk to our test-bench load, I ran the continuous THD+noise vs output power curves only into 4 and 8 ohms. As  .9 shows, there is clearly no shortage of power with this amp. I also ran discrete clipping measurements with a continuous signal, but only into 8 ohms, again because of test-load limits. Into 8 ohms, both channels driven, the Rotel clipped   at 407W   in the left channel  , and 410W   in the right  . With one channel driven, clipping occurred at 437W  .Fig.9 Rotel RB-1090, distortion   vs continuous output power into   8 ohms and 4 ohms.John Atkinson tested the amplifier into lower impedances using a low-duty-cycle 1kHz toneburst generated by the Miller Audio Research Amplifier Profiler. The results are shown in  .10, and even though the amplifier is working harder into 2 ohms   and 1 ohm   than it is into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , the overall distortion level is still very low. The clipping characteristic is quite \"soft,\" with a relatively gradual increase in THD up to the 1% point. This will make the amplifier tend to sound more powerful, except the big Rotel doesnt need help in that respect: with the toneburst and one channel driven it delivers 527W into 8 ohms and a whopping 2825W into 1 ohm!Fig.10 Rotel RB-1090, distortion   vs 1kHz burst output power into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , and 1 ohm  .Altogether, a solid set of test-bench results from the Rotel RB-1090.—Thomas J.

       " '  Creek Evolution 50A using Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  .   on an amplifier, I run it for an hour with both channels driven at 1/3 its rated power into 8 ohms; this is the level at which the maximum amount of power is dissipated in the output devices with a class-A/B topology. However, when I tried this with the Creek Evolution 50A, the amplifier turned itself off after 20 minutes, its front-panel display showing the message \"OVERHEATED.\" An infrared thermometer indicated that the internal heatsinks, visible through slots in the top panel, were at 140.9°F  . Thermally, 1/3 power is very much the worst case for a class-A/B amplifier, but it looks as if the Creeks price has been kept affordable by using undersize heatsinks. This probably wont be a problem with normal use, but the amplifier might go quiet if used to supply continuous loud music at a party. I let the 50A cool down and was then able to continue with the testing.The maximum gain at 1kHz into 4 ohms was 32.5dB with a single-ended signal but, surprisingly, 6dB lower than that with a balanced signal fed to line input 4. The Evolution 50A preserved absolute polarity   with both single-ended and balanced signals, the latter suggesting that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance was constant with frequency, at just under 11k ohms single-ended and 42k ohms balanced.The output impedance at low and middle frequencies, including 6 of speaker cable, was very low, at 0.096 ohm, rising very slightly to 0.113 ohm at 20kHz. As a result of this low impedance, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the way in which our simulated loudspeakers impedance changes with frequency, was minimal  . The traces in this graph, which was taken with the volume control at its maximum   and a balanced signal, show that the Creek has a very wide bandwidth: –2dB at 100kHz, as specified. This correlates with the very short risetimes seen in the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  , which is commendably free from overshoot or ringing. The shape of a 1kHz squarewave was essentially perfect  . The frequency response remained the same at lower settings of the volume control, which operated in accurate 1dB steps.Fig.1 Creek Evolution 50A, balanced input, volume control at \"0dB,\" frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2, Creek Evolution 50A, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3, Creek Evolution 50A, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Treble and Bass controls offer a nominal 10dB of maximum boost and cut. However,  .4 indicates that the swing is closer to ±13dB below 40Hz, and +11/–12dB above 10kHz. Channel separation   was good rather than great, at 70dB L–R and 80dB R–L below 2kHz.Fig.4 Creek Evolution 50A, frequency response at 1V into 8 ohms with Treble and Bass controls set to: \"+10\"  , \"–10\"  , \"0\"    .The Evolution 50A was a quiet amplifier. I test an integrated amplifiers signal/noise ratio with the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum, which is very much the worst-case situation. The unweighted wideband ratio, ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms, was good at 69.4dB left and 70.2dB right, improving to 84.6 and 84.9dB, respectively, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband. Switching an A-weighting filter into circuit gave a further 3dB improvement in the measured ratios.The Evolution 50A is specified as having a maximum power output of \">55W\" into 8 ohms or \">85W\" into 4 ohms. Figs.5 and 6 show that the THD+noise reaches 1%, our usual definition of clipping, at 63W into 8 ohms   and 96W into 4 ohms  . The downward slope below 20W or so of the traces in these graphs suggests that any distortion harmonics are buried beneath the noise floor until a few dB below clipping. I therefore examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a level, 12.65V, equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms or 40W into 4 ohms, where I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise. The result is shown in  .7; the Evolution 50A offers very low levels of distortion in the bass and midrange, with the rise in THD in the treble due to the decreasing effectiveness of negative feedback as the frequency rises.Fig.5 Creek Evolution 50A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Creek Evolution 50A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Creek Evolution 50A, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Despite the low level of THD, the distortion waveform   has spikes visible at the sinewaves zero-crossing points, suggesting a low level of output-stage bias current. These spikes are associated with a picket fence of high-order distortion components  , which will be more audible than might be thought the case from their very low levels.Fig.8 Creek Evolution 50A, 1kHz waveform at 30W into 4 ohms  , 0.006% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Creek Evolution 50A, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 70W into 4 ohms  .Finally, despite the decreasing circuit linearity at high frequencies, the Evolution 50A produced relatively low levels of intermodulation products when fed an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible clipping on an oscilloscope screen  . However, the 1kHz difference product is about 12dB higher in level in the left channel   than in the right  .Fig.10 Creek Evolution 50A, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 70W peak into 4 ohms  .Considering its affordable price, Creeks Evolution 50A measures fundamentally well, though I didnt like the look of those crossover distortion spikes.

       " '  McIntosh MAC7200    . I looked first at its behavior via its balanced and single-ended line inputs, mostly with the volume control set to its maximum, \"100%,\" then at lower settings. I performed a complete set of tests from the receivers 8 ohm output transformer tap, then repeated several tests from the 4 ohm and 2 ohm taps.   receiver by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the heatsinks were very hot, at 151.8°F  . After letting the MAC7200 cool down, I continued the testing.For the balanced input, the maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs into 8 ohms was 38.25dB from the 8 ohm tap, 34.7dB from the 4 ohm tap, and 32.2dB from the 2 ohm tap. The maximum gains from the unbalanced inputs were all 6dB higher. With the jumpers that connect the preamplifier outputs to the power amplifier inputs removed, the gains from the input labeled \"PWR AMP\" measured 20.2dB at the 8 ohm tap, 16.7dB at the 4 ohm tap, and 14.2dB at the 2 ohm tap. From the unbalanced line input at the preamplifier and headphone outputs, the maximum gain measured 15.4dB and 19.6dB, respectively. The MAC7200 preserved absolute polarity   at all of its outputs.The MAC7200s unbalanced line input impedance was 21.5k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to 19k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 33k ohms across the audioband. The power amplifier input impedance was 10k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. The preamplifier output impedance was a low 220 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz, increasing to 403 ohms at 20Hz; the headphone output impedance was 48 ohms at all audio frequencies. The McIntoshs headphone output will work best with high-impedance headphones.The amplifiers output impedance at the 8 ohm tap was 0.16–0.19 ohms depending on frequency. The 4 ohm taps output impedance was 0.114 ohms, that of the 2 ohm tap 0.12 ohms, both from 20Hz to 20kHz. All these measurements include the series impedance of the loudspeaker cable. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was very small, even from the 8 ohm tap  . The small-signal bandwidth with the volume control set to its maximum was flat up to 20kHz from all three output transformer taps and was down by 3dB at 90kHz. Channel matching was excellent and maintained at lower settings of the volume control. The receivers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave from all three taps   was free from overshoot and ringing.Fig.1 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 shows the effects of the treble and bass controls, set to their +12 and –12 positions compared with the response with the controls bypassed. While the maximum boost or cut at low frequencies was ±12dB, it reached ±15dB at high frequencies. Channel separation via the line inputs   was okay, at just below 70dB in both directions. The level of the McIntoshs noise floor depended on the volume control setting. With the control set to its maximum, a small number of low-level supply-related spuriae can be seen just above the random noise floor  . The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was 69.3dB, average of both channels, ref. 2.83V output from all three output taps into 8 ohms. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the S/N ratio to 78.0dB, while switching an A-weighting filter into circuit improved it further to 80.6dB.Fig.3 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum and switched out of circuit  .Fig.4 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to \"100%\"  .Figs.5, 6, and 7 plot the percentage of THD+noise in the MAC7200s speaker output from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms, the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms, and the 2 ohm tap into 2 ohms. In each graph, the THD+N continues to drop as the power decreases below actual waveform clipping, due to the distortion lying beneath the noise floor and the fixed level of noise becoming an increasing percentage of the signal level. The receivers maximum power is specified as being at least 200W from each of the output-transformer taps. Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the 8 ohm tap clipped at 255W into 8 ohms   with both channels driven, the 4 ohm tap at 235W into 4 ohms   with both channels driven, and the 2 ohm tap at 283W into 2 ohms   with one channel driven. More power was available when the load impedance was lower than the nominal tap impedance. For example, with its 8 ohm tap driving 4 ohms, the McIntosh clipped at 340W into 4 ohms  .Fig.5 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 McIntosh MAC7200, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 McIntosh MAC7200, 2 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Fig.8 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I measured how the MAC7200s distortion changed with frequency at 20V output, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms. The THD+N percentage was very low into both loads   and didnt increase at the top of the audioband. As suspected from the clipping graphs, the measurement was being dominated by random noise, which can also be seen in the waveform of the THD+N spuriae  . A hint of second harmonic can be just made out in this graph, which was confirmed by spectral analysis  . Intermodulation distortion was also vanishingly low  .Fig.9 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  .Fig.10 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.0043% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 McIntosh MAC7200, 8 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .I primarily tested the McIntoshs phono input from the preamplifier output with the jumpers to the power amplifier inputs removed. The moving magnet and moving coil modes both preserved absolute polarity at all outputs in all modes. The MM input impedance was an appropriate 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to 39.6k ohms at 20kHz. The MC modes input impedance had been set to 200 ohms; I measured 200.7 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. With the volume control set to its maximum, the MM mode offered 55.7dB of gain at the preamplifier output and 84.8dB at the 8 ohm loudspeaker output. The MC mode offered 20dB higher gain.The MAC7200s RIAA correction offered very low error   and was well-matched between the channels. Channel separation via the phono input was good, at 70dB in both directions at all audio frequencies. The phono inputs noise performance in MM mode was excellent, with unweighted audioband signal/noise ratios   of 79.2dB  . The ratios improved to 84.6dB when A-weighted. The higher gain in the MC mode reduced the S/N ratio; the unweighted wideband ratio ref. 1kHz at 500ÊV was 66.1dB and 83dB, A-weighted.Fig.13 McIntosh MAC7200, phono input, MM mode, response with RIAA correction  The MAC7200s phono input offered excellent overload margins, at >22.5dB ref. 1kHz at 5mV in MM mode and >20dB ref. 1kHz at 500µV in MC mode. The phono inputs distortion was very low, primarily consisting of the second harmonic, but this lay at just –100dB  . Intermodulation distortion via the MAC7200s phono input was also extremely low.Fig.14 McIntosh MAC7200, phono input, MM mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 10mV input  .The McIntosh MAC7200s optical and coaxial S/PDIF digital inputs locked to data sampled up to 192kHz. Apples USB Prober utility, running on my battery-powered MacBook Pro, identified the McIntosh as \"McIntosh HD USB Audio\\\\000...\" from \"McIntosh\\\\000... .\" The USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode, and Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that via USB the MAC7200 accepted 16-, 24-, and 32-bit integer data sampled at all rates from 32kHz to 384kHz.With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in a level at the 8 ohm loudspeaker outputs of 34.64V into 8 ohms, which is equivalent to 150W into 8 ohms. As is often the case with integrated amplifiers with DACs, the MAC7200s digital inputs have too much gain. The –20dBFS digital signal resulted in a level of 1.252V at the preamplifier output and 2V at the headphone output. To avoid damaging the McIntoshs power amplifier stage with high-level digital signals, I performed all the measurements of the digital inputs performance at the preamplifier output. As this output clips with full-scale digital signals with the volume control set to its maximum,  behavior of the digital inputs with the volume control at 76%, a few dB below the setting at which the distortion started to rise. The preamplifier output level at this volume control setting was 3.15V.The McIntoshs USB and S/PDIF inputs preserved absolute polarity. The impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the MAC7200s response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression just above half the sample rate  . An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   is suppressed by more than 110dB, and though the distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone can be seen, these are all very low in level. The second harmonic is the highest in level, at –90dB  . The MAC7200s digital-input frequency response was flat in the audioband and follows the same basic shape, but with a slight peak just before the sharp rolloff at half of each sample rate  .Fig.15 McIntosh MAC7200, digital inputs, impulse response  .Fig.16 McIntosh MAC7200, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.17 McIntosh MAC7200, digital inputs, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Channel separation via the digital inputs was a very good 90dB below 1kHz. When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor components dropped by around 18dB, which implies that the MAC7200 offers around 19 bits worth of resolution. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved. With undithered 24-bit data  , the result was a fairly clean sinewave.Fig.18 McIntosh MAC7200, digital inputs, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Intermodulation distortion via the McIntosh amplifiers digital inputs was very low, but there was an odd scalloping of the noise floor either side of the twin tones at 19kHz and 20kHz  . This modulation of the noise floor was also evident when   MAC7200 for its rejection of word-clock jitter via its S/PDIF and USB inputs, obscuring the odd-order harmonics of the 16-bit J-Test signals LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave  .Fig.19 McIntosh MAC7200, digital inputs, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS peak .Fig.20 McIntosh MAC7200, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit Toslink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Overall, the McIntosh MAC7200 performed very well on the test bench via its line inputs, exceeding its specified power and offering extremely low distortion. It also includes an excellent phono input that offers low noise and low distortion in both MM and MC modes. However, while the digital inputs offer excellent resolution, I was bothered by the modulation of the noise floor with high-level, high-frequency tones  . Footnote 1: This scalloping of the noise floor is probably not audible as such, However, it is always suspicious when a products transfer function is modified by the signal.          ',\n",
       " '  C 3050 LE  . As the NAD is a class-D design, I didnt precondition the amplifier by driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms. Nevertheless, before doing any testing, I ran it for an hour at a moderate power level to ensure that it was fully warmed up. At the end of that time, the temperature of the black grille on the top panel was 92.1°F/33.4°C. Because class-D amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slew-rate limiting, all the measurements other than frequency response were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 250kHz. Without the filter, 294mV of ultrasonic noise with a center frequency of 413kHz was present at the loudspeaker terminals. This noise was also present, at a much lower level, at the headphone output.Looking first at the analog line input: With the NADs volume control set to its maximum, the tone controls active but set to do nothing, the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured a relatively low 29dB from the speaker terminals, 4.2dB from the headphone output, and –0.07dB from the preamplifier output. The line input preserved absolute polarity   from all three output types, and the input impedance was close to the specified 28k ohms at 27k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to 23.6k ohms at 20kHz. The power amplifier input impedance was 50k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 26k ohms at 20kHz, with a voltage gain into 8 ohms of 29dB.Fig.1 NAD C3050 LE, line input, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 NAD C3050 LE, line input, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The preamplifiers output impedance was 433 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz; the impedance at the headphone output was 11 ohms, again from 20Hz to 20kHz. The C 3050 LEs output impedance at the speaker terminals was very low, at 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, 0.1 ohm at 20kHz.   Consequently, the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   is minimal. The traces in  .1 cut off sharply above 20kHz, due to the C 3050 LE converting its line input to digital. The C 3050 LEs reproduction of an analog 1kHz squarewave had the ringing on its leading and trailing edges that are typical of a linear-phase reconstruction filter  , and a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced as a sinewave, due to the odd-order harmonics that would give the wave its square shape being removed by the A/D converters antialiasing filter.Fig.3 NAD C3050 LE, line input, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with Bass and Treble controls set to \"0dB,\" \"+6dB,\" and \"–6dB\"    .Fig.3 shows the effect of the NADs bass and treble controls set to their +6dB and –6dB positions. The bass control offers a range of +6.5dB/–5.5dB below 50Hz, the treble control +5.7dB/–5.2dB at 20kHz. Channel separation was good rather than great, at >70dB in both directions below 1kHz decreasing to 49dB at 20kHz.Fig.4 NAD C3050 LE, line input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .With the Audio Precision ultrasonic filter, the line inputs shorted to ground, and the volume control set to its maximum, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured a good 72.1dB in both channels. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 75dB, and an A-weighting filter increased it further, to 77.4dB. Spectral analysis of the NADs low-frequency noisefloor   revealed no spuriae related to AC power.Fig.5 NAD C3050 LE, line input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 NAD C3050 LE, line input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 NAD C3050 LE, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , and 4 ohms  .The C 3050 LE is specified as delivering a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive, the C 3050 LE clipped at 106Wpc into 8 ohms   and at 155Wpc into 4 ohms  . Distortion levels at moderate powers   were very low, though with an increase in the top two octaves.Fig.8 NAD C3050 LE, line input, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.032% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 NAD C3050 LE, line input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 NAD C3050 LE, line input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .The shape of the THD+N spuriae waveform at 10Wpc into 8 ohms   is obscured by high-frequency noise, even with the Audio Precision filter, but the distortion signature appears to be primarily third-harmonic in nature. This was confirmed by spectral analysis  , with the second harmonic 10dB lower in level. Intermodulation distortion was very low, even into 4 ohms  , though the digitization of this input led to aliasing products at 28kHz and 29kHz. These frequencies suggest that the A/D converter operates at a sample rate of 48kHz.Fig.11 NAD C3050 LE, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .Turning to the NADs MM-compatible phono input, I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the NADs rear panel to obtain the lowest noise. This input preserved absolute polarity at all three outputs. The phono inputs RIAA correction was superbly accurate  , though it cut off sharply above 21kHz due to the input being digitized. The input impedance measured 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping slightly to 34k ohms at 20kHz. The maximum gain at 1kHz was 33.6dB at the Pre output, 38.7dB at the headphone output, and 62.55dB at the loudspeaker outputs. To avoid clipping the power amplifier stage, I turned off the speaker outputs, removed the pre/power jumpers, and performed all the subsequent testing using the preamp output.Fig.12 NAD C3050 LE, phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, for 5mV input  .The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a very good 64.7dB in both channels, ref. 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 71dB, while an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 78.9dB. Spectral analysis of the phono inputs low-frequency noisefloor   revealed very low levels of random noise and no power supply–related spuriae.Fig.13 NAD C3050 LE, phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 20mV input  .Fig.14 NAD C3050 LE, phono input, spectrum of 19 and 20kHz sinewaves, DC–30kHz, for 200mV input  .The phono inputs overload margins ref. 1kHz at 5mV were usefully high, at 19.3dB from 20Hz to 20kHz. The phono inputs distortion signature was an equal mix of second and third harmonics, both lying at a very low –100dB   with 1kHz at an input level of 20mV  . The level of the 1kHz difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones was also very low, at –100dB  .  performance of the C 3050 LEs digital inputs, I used the Audio Precisions optical and coaxial S/PDIF outputs and data sent to the C 3050 LE over my network using BluOS. I saw no significant differences among the data sources. Both S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz.With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in an output level of 5.97V into 8 ohms from the loudspeaker output, which is 13.76dB below the clipping level. A signal at 0dBFS gave levels of 3.45V from the headphone output and 2.13V from the preamplifier output. As with the phono input testing,   digital inputs behavior at the preamplifier output with the speaker outputs turned off.Fig.15 NAD C3050 LE, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.16 NAD C3050 LE, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .The NADs impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the C 3050 LEs response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression at 24kHz, though some low-level scalloping of the ultrasonic noisefloor is present. An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   can be seen at –70dB, and distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noisefloor, the third harmonic being the highest in level at –67dB  .Fig.17 NAD C3050 LE, digital input, frequency response with data sampled at 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.18 NAD C3050 LE, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .When  NADs frequency response with S/PDIF data at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz, the response at all three rates dropped off sharply just below half of each sample rate  . Increasing the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS lowered the noisefloor by 15dB  , meaning that the C 3050 LE offers between 18 and 19 bits of resolution. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a clean sinewave  .Fig.19 NAD C3050 LE, digital input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS peak, sampled at 44.1kHz.The second-order intermodulation product at 1kHz with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 0dBFS lay at a low –97dB  , though the higher-order products at 18kHz and 21kHz were 20dB higher in level. The aliased images of the primary tones are present at 24kHz and 25.1kHz.Fig.20 NAD C3050 LE, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.21 NAD C3050 LE, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit network data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.The NADs rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit TosLink data   was superb, with all the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave at the correct levels, indicated by the sloping green line in this graph. However, the spectral spike that represents the high-level tone at one-quarter the sample rate is broadened at its base due to the presence of low-frequency random noise jitter. Repeating the analysis with 16-bit network data   reduced the level of this random jitter.Like NADs M10, the C 3050 LE offers excellent measured performance overall.           ',\n",
       " '  Parasound Halo A 21+    .   amplifier by operating it at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour.   At the end of this time, the side-mounted heatsinks were very hot, at 162.8°F  . The top panel was also hot, at 116°F  .The Parasounds voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 29.2dB from the balanced inputs, 29.4dB from the unbalanced inputs. In bridged-mono mode, the gain was 34.9dB into 8 ohms. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both balanced and unbalanced input signals and with the right channel used as the input in bridged-mono mode, with the outputs taken from the two positive loudspeaker terminals as described in the manual. The balanced input impedance was high at 90k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to a still-high 84k ohms at 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance was 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies, 37k ohms at the top of the audioband.The Parasounds output impedance was a very low 0.077 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasingly slightly to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore minuscule, at ±0.1dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was flat to almost 20kHz, which correlates with the A 21+s superb reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . Fig.1 was taken with the balanced inputs; the response with the unbalanced input was identical, though in bridged-mono mode, the output at 20kHz was down by a still-trivial 0.25dB, due to the doubling of the amplifiers output impedance in this mode. A slight 0.35dB channel imbalance in favor of the left channel   can be seen in  .1, even though the level controls for the two channels had both been set to their maximum positions.Fig.1 Parasound A21+, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Parasound A21+, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >90dB in both directions below 2kHz, declining to a still-good 72dB at the top of the audioband. Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 78.1dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  , this ratio improving to 88.7dB when the measurement was A-weighted. Low-level spuriae at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its odd harmonics were present in the Parasounds noise floor  . These will be due to magnetic interference from the massive toroidal power transformer and were a little higher in the left channel   than the right  . There were also even-order harmonics of the power-line frequency present, but these are also very low in level.Fig.3 Parasound A21+, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Parasound specifies the A 21+ as delivering 300W into 8 ohms   with both channels driven and 500W into 4 ohms  . Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the Parasound easily exceeded its specified powers with both channels driven with a 1kHz signal. It clipped at 400Wpc into 8 ohms   and at 620Wpc into 4 ohms  . The maximum power into 2 ohms with one channel driven was 900W  , while in bridged-mono mode into 8 ohms—the recommended minimum load in this mode—the amplifier clipped at 1100W  .Fig.4 Parasound A21+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Parasound A21+, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The shape of the traces in  s.4 and 5 suggested that I examine how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was very low in the midrange into 8, 4, and 2 ohms   but rose at higher frequencies. The A 21+s distortion was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  , and higher harmonics are all very low in level  . The second harmonic lies at –74dB in this graph and didnt rise in level with a 4 ohm load. When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50W into 8 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –86dB  , and higher-order intermodulation products were even lower in level. Again, the levels of the distortion harmonics didnt rise when I kept the output voltage the same but reduced the load impedance to 4 ohms.Fig.6 Parasound A21+, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms   2 ohms  .Fig.7 Parasound A21+, 1kHz waveform at 25W into 8 ohms, 0.01% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Parasound A21+, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Parasound A21+, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .The Parasound A 21+ offers a lot of low-distortion power and isnt fazed by impedances as low as 2 ohms.

       " '  Vincent SV-737    . I first preconditioned the amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation, operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the top panel was warm, at 104.6°F  , and the heatsinks hotter, at 113.9°F  . I then performed my usual thermal stress test by running the amplifier at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of this time, the heatsinks temperature had risen to 121.3°F  . The Vincent amplifier has enough thermal capacity for its power rating, though, due to the significant biasing of its output stage into class-A, it runs warm. Be sure to give this amplifier sufficient ventilation.I looked first at the Vincents performance via its line inputs. The maximum gain at the speaker was 34.3dB into 8 ohms, which is a little lower than usual for an integrated amplifier. The maximum gain at the unbalanced preamplifier outputs was 9.54dB, and at the headphone jack it was 35.1dB. Measured at the power amplifier inputs, which bypass the preamplifier section, the gain was 35.5dB into 8 ohms. The amplifier inverted absolute polarity at the loudspeaker outputs but preserved it at the preamplifier and headphone outputs.The single-ended line input impedance was lower than the specified 47k ohms but was still relatively high at 22.7k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 21.7k ohms at 20kHz. The power amplifier input impedance was closer to the specification, at 45.4k ohms. The preamplifier output impedance was a low 90 ohms in the midrange and treble, rising to 121 ohms in the low bass, presumably due to the presence of a coupling capacitor. The headphone output impedance was a very high 805 ohms across the band. This output will work best with high-impedance headphones, like Sennheisers.  The Vincent amplifiers output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was a low 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.18 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore minimal  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB just above 100kHz, which correlates with the Vincents accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  . Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; neither the frequency response nor the excellent channel matching changed at lower settings of the volume control. The response at the preamplifier and headphone outputs was identical to that from the speaker outputs. The Treble control offered close to 8dB boost and cut in the high treble; the Bass control offered 11dB boost or cut in the midbass and below  .Fig.1 Vincent SV-737, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms   4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Vincent SV-737, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Vincent SV-737, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum and switched out of circuit  .Channel separation was good, at >80dB, R–L, and >90dB, L–R, below 2kHz, but closer to 60dB at the top of the audioband. The Vincents unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced line inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, was okay, at 67.5dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms  . This ratio improved to 77dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 80dB when A-weighted. The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its even- and odd-order harmonics  , but these are all relatively low in level.Fig.4 Vincent SV-737, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, volume control set to maximum  .The SV-737s nominal power is specified at 180Wpc into 8 ohms   and 300Wpc into 4 ohms  . With clipping defined as the point at which the THD+noise reaches 1%, the SV-737 clipped with both channels driven at 155Wpc into 8 ohms  . However, the relatively high level of distortion at lower powers puzzled me. Fig.5 was taken with the left channel; I repeated the test with the right channel. The result is shown in  .6. While the clipping power into 8 ohms is still 155W, the distortion at lower powers is significantly lower than it had been in the left channel. Fig.7 shows that the right channel clipped at 240W into 4 ohms  . Though this is again lower than the specified power, I dont hold the wall voltage constant during the testing; it had dropped to 117V with the amplifier clipping.Fig.5 Vincent SV-737, left channel. distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Vincent SV-737, right channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Vincent SV-737, right channel, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. Though the right channels distortion was very low in the bass and midrange into both 8 ohm and 4 ohm loads  , and rose only slightly into 2 ohms  , the left channels distortion was close to 0.1% into all three impedances  . The distortion was predominantly the subjectively benign second harmonic   but was very much higher in the left channel   than the right  .Fig.8 Vincent SV-737, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  . 2 ohms  .Fig.9 Vincent SV-737, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.095% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Vincent SV-737, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .As the Vincents preamplifier and power amplifier sections can be operated independently, I repeated the spectral analysis shown in  .10 by driving the power amplifier directly. The result is shown in  .11. Though the left channel still has higher distortion than the right, the distortion is now very low in both channels. The left channels much higher distortion in  s.5 and 8 must therefore be generated in the preamplifier circuit. It is possible that one of the small-signal tubes in the review sample was not performing to specification, but it is fair to point out that 0.1% of second-harmonic distortion is exceedingly difficult, perhaps even impossible, to hear with music.Fig.11 Vincent SV-737, power amplifier input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .When the SV-737 drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W peak into 4 ohms, very few intermodulation products were present, but as expected these are higher in the left channel   than the right  . While the difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB   in the left channel compared with –90dB   in the right channel, this is still relatively low in level.Fig.12 Vincent SV-737, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .The Vincent SV-737s optical and coaxial S/PDIF digital inputs locked to data sampled up to 192kHz   and preserved absolute polarity at the preamplifier and headphone outputs, but polarity was inverted at the loudspeaker outputs. With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in a level at the loudspeaker outputs of 35.6V, which is equivalent to 158.4W into 8 ohms. This is just above the clipping power into this impedance, and the waveform on the oscilloscope screen was visibly squared off. The level at the headphone output with a 1kHz signal at –12dBFS was 36.87V, and at the preamplifier output it was 1.88V. As often appears to be the case with contemporary integrated amplifiers, the SV-737s digital inputs appear to have around 13dB of excess gain. To avoid damaging the Vincents power amplifier stage with high-level digital signals, I performed all the measurements of the digital inputs performance at the preamplifier output and with the volume control set to –12dB.The digital inputs impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a minimum-phase type, with all the ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the SV-737s response rolled off above 20kHz but had not reached full stop-band suppression at half the sample rate  , and there is some unusual scalloping of the ultrasonic noise floor. An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   lies at –55dBFS, and the distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are higher in the left channel   than the right  . This confirms that the left channels distortion is occurring in the Vincents preamplifier stage. The SV-737s digital-input frequency response was flat in the audioband and follows the same basic shape at all sample rates up to 192kHz, with then a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate  .Fig.13 Vincent SV-737, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.14 Vincent SV-737, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.15 Vincent SV-737, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor components dropped by around 12dB, which implies that the SV-737s digital inputs offer 18 bits worth of resolution. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved. With undithered 24-bit data  , the result was a somewhat noisy sinewave.Fig.16 Vincent SV-737, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.17 Vincent SV-737, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.18 Vincent SV-737, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Intermodulation distortion via the Vincent amplifiers digital inputs was a little higher than it had been for analog input signals  , with some aliased images visible.   SV-737 for its rejection of word-clock jitter via both its TosLink and coaxial S/PDIF inputs. The odd-order harmonics of the 16-bit J-Test signals LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were mostly obscured by the analog noise floor, but where they are visible, they are higher than the correct levels  . With 24-bit J-Test data  , jitter-related sidebands were present at ±229Hz.Fig.19 Vincent SV-737, digital input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms  .Fig.20 Vincent SV-737, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit Toslink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.21 Vincent SV-737, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit Toslink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Assuming that the left channels disappointing linearity was indeed due to an out-of-spec tube in the preamplifier stage, which will be specific to this sample, Vincents SV-737 offers relatively high power with low harmonic and intermodulation distortion. The digital inputs and headphone output, however, should be regarded as more for convenience than for absolute performance. Footnote 1: I wasnt able to test the performance with the Bluetooth input.          ',\n",
       " 'The D 3020 was voted Stereophiles \"Budget Component of 2014.\" Getting the review sample onto my test bench had been on my to-do list for way too long, but I was reminded of the unfinished task when I picked up the PS Audio Sprout for measurement from Herb Reichert, whose review of the latter appears elsewhere in this issue. I first checked the performance of the D 3020s digital inputs, looking at the signal from the headphone output jack    .The headphone output preserved absolute polarity for both analog and digital input signals, and the output impedance was on the high side, at 200 ohms at all audio frequencies. For analog input signals, the D 3020s headphone output offers a maximum gain of 28.6dB, but a digital signal with a level of –12dBFS clipped the headphone output with the volume control set to its maximum. At –14dBFS, the unclipped output level was 6.81V; so, except as noted, for the digital-input measurements I reduced the volume-control setting, to avoid clipping. The D 3020 locked to an S/PDIF datastream with sample rates up to 192kHz, even via TosLink, though the USB input was restricted to 96kHz and below. Apples USB Prober utility identified the D 3020 as \"NAD USB Audio\" with the serial-number string \"  2011 Wavelength Audio, ltd.\" This implies that the D 3020 uses Gordon Rankins \"Streamlength\" asynchronous USB protocol and USB Prober did indeed confirm that the USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode.The reconstruction filters impulse response   was a conventional FIR type, with time-symmetrical ringing, while wideband spectral analysis of the analog output as the NAD decoded 44.1Hz data representing white noise at –4dBS   indicated that the response rolled off quickly above half the sample rate  . The sampling image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   was suppressed by more than 90dB. Note the rise in the ultrasonic noise floor in  .2, suggesting that the D 3020s DAC stage uses some kind of sigma-delta upsampling. Fig.3 is a more conventional response measurement, taken with 44.1, 96, and 192kHz data. The overall shape of the response at ultrasonic frequencies is the same—a small, 0.4dB rise above the audioband—broken by a sharp rolloff just below 22 and 47kHz with the two lower rates.Fig.1 NAD D 3020, headphone output, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.2 NAD D 3020, headphone output, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with USB data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.3 NAD D 3020, headphone output, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .To assess the D 3020s digital resolution, I set the volume control to its maximum, an unrealistic situation that did allow me to examine by how many dB the noise floor dropped when I changed from 16-bit data representing a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS to 24-bit data. Fig.4 shows that the noise floor dropped by almost 20dB, indicating ultimate resolution of better than 19 bits—superb performance, even without taking into account the D 3020s very affordable price. The NADs reproduction of an undithered 16-bit, 1kHz sinewave at exactly –90.31dBFS   was essentially perfect, with the three DC voltage levels described by the data easily visible. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a superbly well-defined sinewave  .Fig.4 NAD D 3020, headphone output, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.5 NAD D 3020, headphone output, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.6 NAD D 3020, headphone output, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Only when it came to jitter did I encounter some anomalous behavior via the D 3020s digital inputs. Fig.7 shows the spectrum of the headphone output with 24-bit J-Test data fed to the D 3020s USB input. No sidebands are visible around the 11.025kHz tone, and the noise floor is superbly clean. By contrast,  .8 shows the spectrum of the analog output with the same data fed to the optical S/PDIF input. Some sidebands of unknown origin are visible, and the noise floor now has a peculiar sculpted appearance. This modulation of the noise floor was not apparent with the 19.1kHz tone in  .2, which was taken with USB data. Repeating that test with S/PDIF data, I got a similar noise-floor modulation to that seen in  .8.Fig.7 NAD D 3020, headphone output, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit data from MacBook Pro via USB  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.8 NAD D 3020, headphone output, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit data from MacBook Pro via TosLink  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Whereas the original 3020 used a conventional output stage, based on a complementary pair of 2N2055/MJ2955 bipolar transistors, the D 3020, as its name implies, is a class-D design, and so produces ultrasonic noise that would overload the Audio Precisions input circuitry. I therefore performed most of the tests of the D 3020 as a power amplifier using, ahead of the analyzer, an Audio Precision AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz.  Assessed at the speaker outputs, the D 3020 offered a modest maximum gain for line-level sources of 33.8dNB and was non-inverting. The input impedance ranged from 14.3k ohms at 20Hz to 11k ohms at 20kHz; the output impedance was around 0.15 ohm at all audio frequencies, resulting in a modulation of the amplifiers frequency response of less than ±0.15dB with our standard simulated loudspeaker  . The response was –0.5dB at 20kHz, above which it rolled off sharply.   Commendably, the response didnt change at different volume-control settings, and switching the Bass equalization into circuit gave a boost of just over 6dB, centered between 70 and 80Hz, with a sharp rolloff below that region  . The D 3020s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave with the Audio Precision low-pass filter in circuit was well defined, with just the slightest hint of overshoot on the leading edges  .Fig.9 NAD D 3020, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.10 NAD D 3020, volume control set to –20dB, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with Bass EQ activated   and inactive    .Fig.11 NAD D 3020, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was >80dB in both directions below 1kHz, while the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the volume control set to its maximum, but the input shorted and with the AP filter in-circuit, was an excellent 80.2dB; this improved to 91.3dB when A-weighted. Fig.12 shows a spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor.Fig.12 NAD D 3020, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 13 and 14 show how the percentage of THD+noise in the NADs output changed with output power into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. The minimum distortion level was low, and the D 3020 clipped   at 58Wpc into 8 ohms   and 68Wpc into 4 ohms  . These two graphs reveal that the actual distortion is buried beneath the noise floor at levels below a few watts. I therefore examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 9V, equivalent to 10Wpc into 8 ohms or 20Wpc into 4 ohms. The result   revealed no change in the distortion at different frequencies, a commendable result.Fig.13 NAD D 3020, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.14 NAD D 3020, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.15 NAD D 3020, THD+N   vs frequency at 9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion at lower powers was primarily the third harmonic  , with the second harmonic becoming predominant at higher powers  , though lower-level, higher-order harmonics are also present. Intermodulation distortion was also low, even at a level a few dB below visible waveform clipping  .Fig.16 NAD D 3020, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 4 ohms, 0.014% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.17 NAD D 3020, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 35W into 4 ohms  .Fig.18 NAD D 3020, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 23W peak into 8 ohms  .I was impressed by the NAD D 3020s technical performance. It packs a usefully powerful amplifier into a tiny package, and offers digital performance that is close to the state of the art, though its USB input is to be preferred. In fact, the only problems I had with this little gem was that the touch switch on its top panel, for bringing the amplifier out of and into standby, didnt always respond. And the first time I tried disabling the Bass boost with the tiny rear-panel pushbutton, the D 3020 locked up and wouldnt respond to any commands, necessitating a hard reboot.Stephen Mejias concluded his original review of the D 3020 by asking, \"Will [] be the component that introduces a new generation of music lovers to true high-fidelity sound?\" Id like to think that the answer to that question is \"Yes!\"           ',\n",
       " '  Marantz PM-KI-Pearl with Stereophiles loan sample of the   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. , I run it for 60 minutes at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms. Thermally, this is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. At the end of this period, the Marantzs case was warm to the touch, but the grilles above its internal heatsink werent so hot that I couldnt keep my hands on them, implying a temperature around 130°F  . The amplifiers heatsinking is clearly adequate for its output power.Assessed at the Pearls Tape Out jacks, its phono input offered 38.3dB of gain set to MM   and 56.75dB set to MC  , though the latter  ure will have been decreased a little by the Ohms Law interaction between the generators 20 ohm source impedance and the 101 ohm measured input impedance of the MC input. Set to MM, the input impedance was 48k ohms at all frequencies. The phono input preserved absolute polarity   in both MM and MC modes. The unweighted, audioband signal/noise ratio was excellent in both modes, at 70.4dB   and 53.9dB  , these  ures improving, when A-weighted, to 81.1dB and 63.7dB, respectively. Channel separation   was superb, at almost 90dB over most of the audioband.The KI-Pearls RIAA error is shown in  .1; the departure from perfect equalization is vanishingly low in the left channel  , but reaches a maximum of +0.4dB in the midbass in the right channel  . Both channels start to roll out below 30Hz, reaching –2dB just below 10Hz; at the other end of the spectrum, the response above 16kHz appears to follow the so-called Neumann \"fourth pole\" modification  .Fig.1 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, RIAA error of phono input  .The Pearls phono input offered very low distortion at normal signal levels, around 0.03% THD+noise, but also featured superb overload margins. The MM mode didnt reach 1% THD+N until nearly 30dB at all audio frequencies above the standard 1kHz at 5mV, while the MC mode exceeded even that, at 32dB ref. 500µV at 1kHz at all frequencies. To put this margin into perspective, the output at the Pearls Tape Out jacks was more than 12V when the phono input reached its overload limit!Turning to the CD input, which MF found gave the best sound from the KI-Pearl, this offered a maximum gain of 41.1dB measured at the speaker terminals, and 17.1dB measured at the Preamp Out jacks, both of which are typical for an integrated amplifier. Neither output inverted signal polarity, and the input impedance was a moderately high 20k ohms. The output impedance from the Preamp Out jacks was 217 ohms at high and middle frequencies, rising to 495 ohms at 20Hz. From the speaker terminals, the output impedance was very low, at <0.07 ohms. The modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was thus also very low  .Fig.2 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 also shows that the Pearl offers a wide bandwidth into higher impedances, which ties in with the excellent 10kHz squarewave response with short risetimes and flat tops  . The output does start to roll off above 16kHz into 2 ohms, however  ; in addition, this graph was taken with the volume control set to –12dB. At the controls maximum setting, the Pearls output into 8 ohms   was –3dB at 80kHz rather than the >200kHz seen in  .2. The channel balance was excellent at all volume-control settings, however, and the control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps. When switched into circuit, the tone controls offered maximum swings of ±10dB at 50Hz and 20kHz  . Channel separation   was good rather than great at 80dB at 1kHz, while the unweighted, wideband S/N ratio, ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum, was 57dB. The latter improved to 71.4dB when A-weighted.Fig.3 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.4 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, frequency response at 1V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to maximum and minimum positions  .Specified at 90Wpc into 8 ohms   and 140Wpc into 4 ohms  , the KI-Pearl actually clipped at 103Wpc into 8 ohms   and 160Wpc into 4 ohms  . This can be seen from  .5, which plots the THD+N percentage in the amplifiers output against output power. The actual distortion is buried beneath the noise below a few tens of watts, so I plotted how the THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a relatively high level, 10V RMS, equivalent to 12.5W into 8 ohms. The results are shown in  .6; the distortion is very low in the midrange but rises at very low frequencies, perhaps due to the influence of noise, and both at high frequencies and into low impedances. The left channel   is less good in these respects than the right  . However, unlike our first sample of Marantzs inexpensive PM5003 integrated amplifier  , this behavior was not affected when the Pearls tone controls were in circuit.Fig.5 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4 ohms.Fig.6 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .At moderate levels and into higher impedances, the KI-Pearls distortion signature comprises mostly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  . Though some higher-order spuriae appear at higher powers and into lower impedances, these are all still very low in level  . Intermodulation distortion was also very low, even at high power into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, 1kHz waveform at 13W into 8 ohms  , 0.0064% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 72W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Marantz PM-KI-Pearl, tone controls in-circuit but set to flat, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 106W peak into 4 ohms  .The Marantz PM-KI-Pearls excellent measured performance is a fitting tribute to Ken Ishiwata, its progenitor and dedicatee.

       " '  Classé Sigma 2200i    . Out of the box, I ran into problems. Despite Classés excellent manual, I couldnt at first define one of the Sigma 2200is digital inputs to accept USB data. Eventually, I got the input to behave by defining the input, then turning the amplifier off and back on again. Then, I couldnt get the Sigma 2200i to accept a balanced signal at the input marked \"XLR L1/R1.\" But then I remembered that, when I was setting up the USB input with the onscreen menu, Id had to select a specific input connector for that input, in that case USB. Checking the setup menu for the XLR input, it had been set by a prior user to accept a signal from the unbalanced \"Line 2\" RCA jacks. Once Id set it to accept a signal fed to the balanced XLR jacks, all was well—except that the amplifier now went into standby after running for 19 minutes. The manual says that \"A power-save feature is enabled that puts the Sigma 2200i into standby after 20 minutes without a signal at its input.\" In my case, even with a signal present, the amplifier continued to turn itself off every 19 minutes.  Sigma 2200is performance via its digital inputs using either S/PDIF signals fed from the SYS2722, or WAV and AIFF test-tone files played with Pure Music 3.0 by my MacBook Pro running on battery power and fed via USB. All   at the speaker terminals. For the measurements taken to characterize the Classés performance as a conventional amplifier, I fed a single-ended analog signal to the Line 2 inputs or a balanced signal to the XLR inputs.Looking first at the Classés performance in the digital domain: Apples USB Prober utility identified the amplifier as the \"Sigma 2200i 22A5A7\" from \"B&W Group Ltd,\" and confirmed that its serial number was \"2270631.\" The USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. Apples AudioMIDI app indicated that the Classé operated at all PCM sample rates up to 192kHz via USB, with integer bit depths of up to 24. With the volume control set to \"0.0,\" the amplifiers output level into 8 ohms with a 1kHz sinewave at –20dBFS was 9.415V, meaning that it would clip with full-scale digital data. I therefore set the volume control at \"–13.5\" for most of the digital input tests, increasing it to \"0.0\" for only the low-level tests.The Classés impulse response with data sampled at 44.1kHz   indicates that its reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type and that the amplifier as a whole inverts signal polarity. Tested with 44.1kHz-sampled white noise at –4dBFS  , this filter can be seen to rapidly roll off the output above the Nyquist frequency  , but there is an increase in ultrasonic noise above that frequency, this presumably due to the Sigma 2200is PWM output stage. The harmonics of a full-scale 19.1kHz tone   are a little higher than I was expecting, with the third harmonic lying at –54dB  .Fig.1 Classé Sigma 2200i, impulse response  .Fig.2 Classé Sigma 2200i, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.3 shows spectral analyses of the Classés output while it decoded dithered 16- and 24-bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS. With 16-bit data  , the spectrum is dominated by the dither noise. However, with 24-bit data, while the noise floor has dropped by 24dB, suggesting resolution of at least 20 bits, harmonics of the fundamental tone are visible. This graph was taken with TosLink data; USB data gave an identical result. But with its low noise floor in the audioband, the Sigmas reproduction of an undithered 16-bit signal at exactly –90.31dBFS was superb  , with the three DC voltage levels described by the data and the ringing of the reconstruction filter clearly visible. Note that even though the traces in  .4 were taken at the speaker terminals, there is zero DC offset visible. This is rare with amplifiers having a conventional output stage.Fig.3 Classé Sigma 2200i, 44.1kHz S/PDIF data, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.4 Classé Sigma 2200i, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Tested for its digital inputs rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit, 44.1kHz data, the Sigma 2200i didnt accentuate or attenuate the odd-order harmonics of the J-Tests low-frequency, LSB-level squarewave  . However, the spectral peak that represents the high-level tone at one-quarter the sample rate has widened at its base, which suggests the presence of random low-frequency jitter. Also visible is a patch of spurious low-level tones between 9 and 10kHz that were present with 24-bit J-Test data  . A wider spectral analysis reveals these more clearly  , as well as an idle tone of unknown origin at 15kHz.Fig.5 Classé Sigma 2200i, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.6 Classé Sigma 2200i, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit USB data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.7 Classé Sigma 2200i, spectrum of analog output signal, 1Hz–24kHz, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit USB data  .Also in  .7 can be seen the start of the PWM output stages ultrasonic noise floor. Because of the presence of this noise, when   amplifiers performance using analog input signals, I used Audio Precisions high-order AES17 high-pass filter when measuring distortion, as otherwise the reading would be obscured by the noise.The Sigma 2200is overall gain via its analog inputs with the volume control set to \"0.0\" was 27.4dB balanced and 33.4dB unbalanced, the 6dB difference being in the opposite direction to what I usually find. All the analog inputs inverted absolute polarity, and the unbalanced input impedance was 46k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 35k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was a high 90k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 84k ohms at 20kHz.The analog inputs are converted to 96kHz-sampled digital, so the Sigma 2200is frequency response measured via these inputs rolls off sharply above 40kHz  . The output impedance was 0.1 ohm at low and middle frequencies, but rose to 1.5 ohms at the top of the audioband. The response therefore peaks a little between 10 and 40kHz into higher impedances, which in turn results in overshoot with a 1kHz squarewave  . But with 2 ohms, the high output impedance at high frequencies results in an output that is down by 4dB at 20kHz  . Although there is very little change in the amplifiers frequency response below 1kHz with our standard simulated loudspeaker  , the top-octave sound of the Sigma 2200i will vary more than usual, depending on the loudspeakers used. With a 10kHz squarewave, the 96kHz sample rate gives a band-limited response   that also reveals the presence of the ultrasonic noise.Fig.8 Classé Sigma 2200i, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.9 Classé Sigma 2200i, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.10 Classé Sigma 2200i, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The effects of the Sigma 2200is treble and bass tone controls, set to their maximum and minimum settings, is shown in  .11. The boost and cut are sensibly chosen. I didnt test the effect of the Tilt control, as I couldnt manage to set this correctly using the onscreen menu. Channel separation was good, at >80dB L–R and >90dB R–L below 3kHz. Though the output was commendably free from power-supply–related spuriae  , the wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the analog input shorted to ground and the volume control set to \"0.0,\" was affected by the output stages ultrasonic noise and was just 29.7dB  . Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the S/N ratio to 58.1dB; A-weighting further increased it, to 75.75dB.Fig.11 Classé Sigma 2200i, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with bass and treble controls set to: \"0\"  , \"+6\"  , \"–6\"    .Fig.12 Classé Sigma 2200i, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .I then plotted how the percentage of THD+noise varied with output power, using the AES17 low-pass filter set to 20kHz. The Classé offered very low distortion and high power below clipping into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  . These graphs reveal that the amplifier clipped at 215Wpc into 8 ohms   and 410Wpc into 4 ohms  , both powers slightly higher than the specified 23dBW.Fig.13 Classé Sigma 2200i, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.14 Classé Sigma 2200i, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.15 shows how the THD+N percentage varied with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The AES17 low-pass filter was again set to 20kHz, which is why the graph ends at 5kHz rather than the usual 20kHz, in order not to eliminate the higher harmonics. The distortion is very low into 8 ohms  , with a slight rise in the treble. The THD+N percentage rises more at high frequencies into lower impedances, with the 2 ohm measurement higher than 0.1% above 1kHz  . The distortion at this power level seems primarily to be the third harmonic  , accompanied by some lower-level, higher odd-order harmonics  . Assessed with my usual mix of equal-level 19 and 20kHz tones, the intermodulation distortion was very low  . However, you can see in this graph the start of the rise in the ultrasonic noise floor, examined in more detail in  .19.Fig.15 Classé Sigma 2200i, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.16 Classé Sigma 2200i, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 4 ohms, 0.017% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.17 Classé Sigma 2200i, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.18 Classé Sigma 2200i, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.19 Classé Sigma 2200i, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–50kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .Its use of a PWM output stage doesnt seem to have compromised the Classé Sigma 2200is measured performance, and the amplifier offers high power in an attractively lightweight package. But I dont think it would be a good match for loudspeakers that would present it with impedances as low as 2 ohms. Footnote 1: My thanks to Jürgen Reis, of MBL, for suggesting this test to me.          ',\n",
       " 'I started testing the sample of the Technics SU-R1000 that KM had auditioned, serial number GJ1001007,    . However, while I was performing the small-signal tests, the amplifier turned itself off. The temperature of the black grilles on the amplifiers top panel, which cover the internal heatsinks, was 127.9°F/52.9°C. I wondered if the amplifier had over-heated. According to the manual, \"one of the units safety devices may have been activated. Press the unit on/off button to the Off position. If the unit does not switch to standby, disconnect the AC power supply cord, wait for at least 3 minutes, then reconnect it.\"I followed these instructions, waiting 20 minutes instead of 3 minutes to allow the amplifier to cool down. However, when I turned the amplifier on, it turned itself off and would not turn itself on again. Bill Voss, Technics USs business development manager, had a new sample, serial number GJ1DA001010, shipped to me so that I could continue with the measurements.As the SU-R1000 has an output stage operating in a mode that resembles class-D  , I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter between the test load and the Audio Precision analyzer. This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive its input circuitry into slew-rate limiting. I used it for all the loudspeaker output tests other than frequency response. After two hours of operation, the temperature of the black grilles was lower than that of the first sample, at 114.2°F  .I looked first at the Technicss performance via its balanced and single-ended line inputs. The SU-R1000 preserved absolute polarity at all outputs. The volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps, and the maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 46.5dB for both types of inputs.   At the preamplifier output, the gain was 16.7dB and at the headphone output it was 33.1dB. The Technicss power amplifier can be accessed separately. It offered a fixed gain of 30.1dB. The input impedance at the unbalanced line inputs was 50k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, with an inconsequential drop to 37k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 92k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to 64k ohms at the top of the audioband. The input impedance at the single-ended power amplifier input jacks was 50k ohms at 20Hz, 65k ohms at 1kHz, and 42k ohms at 20kHz.The amplifiers output impedance at the headphone output was a relatively high 100 ohms. At the preamplifier output, it ranged from 728 ohms at 20Hz to 706 ohms at 20kHz. The output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising to 0.7 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore a low ±0.25dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   peaked by almost 2dB at 70kHz but rolled off rapidly above that frequency.   With a resistive 4 ohm load  , the output started to roll off slightly in the top audio octave, reaching –3dB at 61kHz. Into 2 ohms  , the output was down by 3dB at 18kHz. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum. The excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control.Fig.1 Technics SU-R1000, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms   4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .The SU-R1000 has a unique LAPC function, which is intended to compensate for the changes in a loudspeakers impedance with frequency. I investigated this by connecting an 8 ohm resistor to the left channel and my simulated loudspeaker to the right.   I selected LAPC with the remote control, waited for the amplifier to finish measuring the load impedances, and after it said that it was finished,   SU-R1000s frequency response with and without LAPC. The blue and red traces in  .2 were taken without LAPC and are identical to the blue and gray traces in  .1, plotted with an expanded scale. The green and gray traces respectively show the responses of the 8 ohm resistor and the simulated loudspeaker with LAPC. The variations in response have been reduced in amplitude but not eliminated. I suspect that the SU-R1000 is applying the same LAPC compensation to both channels; in real-world use of course, the channels would be connected to identical loudspeakers.Fig.2 Technics SU-R1000, volume control set to –20dB, frequency response at 2.83V into simulated loudspeaker load   and 8 ohms   with LAPC bypassed, and into simulated loudspeaker load   and 8 ohms   with LAPC activated  .The peak at 70kHz with 8 ohms in  .1 correlates with the slight overshoot with the Technicss reproduction of a 10kHz squarewaves leading edges into that load  . There is also some ringing and a slight overshoot with the waveforms trailing edges, both of which will be due to the antialiasing filter of the amplifiers A/D converter. There are three tone controls: bass, midrange, and treble. These offered a maximum boost of 7.8dB and a maximum cut of 6.3dB  . The gray and green traces were taken with the midrange control operating but set to \"0.\" You can see that this control covers the region between 300Hz and 3kHz.Fig.3 Technics SU-R1000, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 2.5kHz and still 67dB at the top of the audioband. Without the auxiliary low-pass filter, 316mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the loudspeaker outputs. With the filter, the Technicss unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced line inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, was 48.2dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms in both channels.   This ratio improved to 71dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 74.4dB when A-weighted. Spuriae at the supply frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics were absent in the amplifiers output, but the spectrum of the random noise background varied with the setting of the volume control. The magenta and red traces in  .5 were taken with the volume control set to the maximum. Reducing the volume to \"–20.0\" lowered the levels of the random noise at higher frequencies in both channels  . However, even at the maximum volume control setting the noise is relatively low in level.Fig.4 Technics SU-R1000, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with treble, midrange, and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum and set to \"0\"  , and with midrange set to \"0\"  Fig.5 Technics SU-R1000, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, volume control set to maximum   and to –20dB  .With both channels driven, the SU-R1000 exceeded its specified maximum power into 8 ohms of 150Wpc  , delivering 190Wpc at 1% THD+noise  . Into 4 ohms, the Technics clipped at 355Wpc  , which is still higher than the specified power into that load. I didnt test clipping power into 2 ohms, as the amplifier isnt specified into that load. The distortion is low at low powers, so I examined how the THD+N varied with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms. The results are shown in  .8. The distortion is very similar into both impedances, at <0.03%. It does rise in the top two octaves, however—more into 4 ohms   than into 8 ohms  .Fig.6 Technics SU-R1000, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Technics SU-R1000, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Technics SU-R1000, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion was predominantly the third harmonic  , but at low and moderate powers it lay below the analog noisefloor. The third harmonic can just be seen at –89dB   when the Technics drove a 50Hz tone at 100Wpc into 4 ohms   with the volume control set to –12dB. I got somewhat different results in the two channels when the SU-R1000 drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 50W peak into 8 ohms  . The second-order difference product at 1kHz is very low in both channels, at close to –110dB  , but more high-order products are present in the right channel   than the left  . I repeated this test with different signal and speaker cables and with the analyzer input channels swapped but got the same result each time. It is fair to note that other than those at 17kHz, 18kHz, 21kHz, and 22kHz, all the intermodulation products lay at or below –84dB   in both channels.Fig.9 Technics SU-R1000, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.052% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Technics SU-R1000, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Technics SU-R1000, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .The Technics SU-R1000 offered excellent measured performance from its line inputs.Digital Input Measurements: I looked at the Technics SU-R1000s digital-input performance using its TosLink input, then repeated some of the tests with the USB input. To avoid damaging the power amplifier stage with high-level digital data, I primarily examined the digital inputs behavior at the headphone output, which mutes the loudspeaker output. The SU-R1000s optical and coaxial S/PDIF inputs locked to data sampled up to 192kHz. Apples Audio-MIDI utility revealed that the USB inputs accepted 16-, 24-, and 32-bit integer data sampled at rates up to 768kHz. Apples USB Prober utility identified the Technics as \"Technics USB Audio\" from \"Panasonic Corporation\" and confirmed that the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode.The Technics SU-R1000s digital inputs all preserved absolute polarity. With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at –30dBFS resulted in a level at the preamplifier output of 441.4mV, at the headphone output of 2.918V, and at the loudspeaker outputs of 13.44V. The latter voltage is 9.2dB below the amplifiers measured clipping voltage into 8 ohms. It appears, therefore, that the digital inputs have around 21dB of excess gain. Fortunately, the SU-R1000 has a 20dB input attenuator setting that can be activated for both analog and digital inputs.The impulse response with 44.1kHz data and MQA decoding turned off   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. Turning on MQA resulted in a short, minimum-phase impulse response  ; this is the filter applied by the MQA decoder to non-MQA data. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the linear-phase filters response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression at 24kHz, just above half the sample rate  . The aliased image at 25kHz of a 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS   is completely suppressed, and the highest-level distortion harmonic of the 19.1kHz tone lay at –70dB  . With the MQA decoder active, white noise rolled off slowly above the audioband, and a large number of aliased images of a 19.1kHz tone were visible both in and above the audioband. Reducing the level of the 19.1kHz tone by 3dB eliminated most of these images  .Fig.12 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, MQA decoding switched off, impulse response  .Fig.13 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, MQA decoding switched on, impulse response  .Fig.14 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, MQA decoding switched off, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.15 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, MQA decoding switched on, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at –3dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .The digital-input frequency response with the MQA decoder active was flat in the audioband then rolled off relatively gently above half of each sample rate  . The levels of the two channels were perfectly matched.Fig.16 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, MQA decoding switched on, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .  ultimate resolution of the SU-R1000s digital inputs, I disabled the 20dB attenuation, set the volume control to its maximum, and examined the spectrum at the headphone output with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16- and 24-bit data  .Fig.17 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, no input attenuation and volume control set to maximum, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .With 24-bit data, the noisefloor dropped by 30dB at low and middle frequencies, which implies that the SU-R1000 offers close to 21.5 bits of resolution. However, the headphone output will be well into clipping at levels typical of music recordings, so I reran this test with the 20dB attenuator in-circuit and the volume control set to –5dB.   The increase in bit depth now lowers the noisefloor by around 9dB at low and middle frequencies  , which suggests that in practical use the SU-R1000s digital inputs will give between 17 and 18 bits of resolution.  Fig.18 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, 20dB attenuation active and volume control set to \"–5.0,\" spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved. With undithered, 24-bit data  , the result was a relatively clean sinewave. Intermodulation distortion via the Technics amplifiers digital inputs with the MQA filter active was extremely low in both channels. Though the expected aliasing products were present, I could eliminate those in the audioband by reducing the level of the mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones by 3dB  .Fig.19 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.20 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Fig.21 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, MQA decoding switched on, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at –3dBFS peak  .  SU-R1000 for its rejection of word-clock jitter via its TosLink and USB input using 16- and 24-bit J-Test data sampled at 44.1kHz. All the odd-order harmonics of the 16-bit J-Test signals LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were close to the correct levels  , though a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz can be seen surrounding the spectral spike that represents the high-level tone at one-quarter of the 44.1kHz sample rate.Fig.22 Technics SU-R1000, digital inputs, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Phono Input Measurements: Turning to the SU-R1000s balanced and single-ended phono inputs, I followed the manuals advice, connecting a separate ground wire from the terminal on the amplifiers chassis to the ground of the Audio Precision analyzer. I primarily examined the phono inputs behavior at the headphone output, again to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stages with high-level signals. The Technicss phono inputs all preserved absolute polarity.The phono inputs can operate at full level or have their sensitivity reduced by 3dB, 6dB, or 9dB. Without the attenuation, the balanced phono input, which is only compatible with moving coil cartridges, has a maximum gain of 72.6dB at the preamplifier outputs, 89.1dB at the headphone outputs, and 102.3dB at the speaker outputs. The single-ended phono input, set to moving magnet, offered maximum gains of 56.0dB, 72.5dB, and 85.7dB, respectively. The balanced phono input had an input impedance of 112 ohms across the audioband; set to MM, the single-ended phono inputs impedance was 44k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, falling to 35k ohms at 20kHz.I didnt test the Intelligent Phono EQ, but even without it the SU-R1000s RIAA correction   was extraordinarily accurate—one of the best I have ever measured—with superb channel matching. The switchable subsonic filter   rolled off the response by 3dB at 20Hz. The MM phono inputs unweighted, wideband S/N ratio, measured with the input shorted to ground, was a very good 67.2dB   referred to an input signal of 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased the ratio to 75dB, while switching an A-weighting filter into circuit increased the ratio to 84.6dB. The balanced MC inputs ratios were around 20dB lower due to this inputs higher gain.Fig.23 Technics SU-R1000, phono input, response with RIAA correction into 100k ohms   and with subsonic filter    .The overload margins of the Technics phono inputs, measured with no input attenuation and with the volume control set to –30dB to avoid clipping the headphone output, were at least 15.3dB ref. 1kHz at 5mV, MM, and 17.5dB ref. 1kHz at 500µV, balanced MC, from 20Hz to 20kHz. The phono stages distortion was very low: The only harmonic visible above the noisefloor was the second, at just –90dB  . High-order intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak input level equivalent to 1kHz at 10mV, was very low in level  , though the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB  .Fig.24 Technics SU-R1000, MM phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100mV peak input  .As with the Technics SU-R1000s line-level analog inputs, this amplifiers digital and phono inputs offered excellent measured performance.

       " '  Masters Series M22,    . As the M22 has a class-D output stage, for almost all measurements I used an Audio Precision AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter ahead of the analyzer, which eliminates noise above 200kHz.The M22s voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 28.9dB from both its balanced and unbalanced inputs, and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The unbalanced input impedance measured 23k ohms at 20Hz, dropping to 18k ohms at 1kHz and 10k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was a consistent 75k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 70k ohms at the top of the audioband.The output impedance was very low for an amplifier with a class-D output stage: 0.05 ohm at 20Hz, 0.03 ohm at 1kHz, and 0.07 ohm at 20kHz  . As a result, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.05dB  , and the audioband response didnt change as a pure resistive load dropped from 8 ohms   to 2 ohms  . This graph was taken without the AP low-pass filter; a sharply defined peak is visible at 60kHz and is most developed into 8 ohms. This ultrasonic peak results in a small degree of critically damped overshoot on the leading edges of a 10kHz squarewave  .Fig.1 NAD M22, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 NAD M22, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was superb, at >100dB in both directions below 2kHz, and still 88dB at 20kHz. Without the AP low-pass filter and no audio signal, around 330mV of RF noise was present at the M22s output, with a center frequency of 446kHz  . The unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref.2.83V into 8 ohms and measured with the NADs unbalanced input shorted to ground, was 72.9dB left and 70.0dB right, these  ures improving respectively to 99.6 and 99.1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 102.4 and 101.9dB when A-weighted. This is superb performance, but the slightly lower ratios in the right channel are due to a very small amount of power-supply contamination  . As all these spuriae are 120dB below the level of a 1W signal, they are inconsequential.Fig.3 NAD M22, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.4 plots how the percentage of total harmonic distortion plus noise in the M22s output changed with power into 8 ohms with both channels driven. NAD usually specifies maximum power in terms of short-term delivery, but for the M22 quotes a power of >300Wpc into 8 ohms   at 0.1% THD+N with both channels driven. Fig.4 indicates that the THD+N reaches 1%   at 340Wpc into 8 ohms  . Fig.5 shows that the M22 clips at 400Wpc into 4 ohms with both channels continuously driven  , while with just one channel driven  , the amplifier clips at 570W  . Even into 2 ohms, the NAD M22 managed to output 700W   with just one channel driven.Fig.4 NAD M22, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 NAD M22, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 NAD M22, one channel driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.With the M22s very low level of noise, I had to test how its THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a very high level, 28.3V  , to be sure I was looking at true distortion. Even so, the distortion remained very low and uniform with frequency, with a small rise in the top octave  . That the distortion waveform at this power level was primarily the subjectively innocuous third harmonic   was confirmed by spectral analysis  . Testing the M22 at very high power with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones   showed that the second-order intermodulation product at 1kHz lay close to –110dB  , with the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz higher in the left channel   than in the right  . Even so, at –82dB  , these are of no concern.Fig.7 NAD M22, THD+N   vs frequency at 28V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 NAD M22, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.0039% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 NAD M22, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 NAD M22, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .NADs Masters Series M22 amplifier measures extraordinarily well. It is the very model of a modern class-D amplifier! Footnote 1: Unlike the Spec RPA-W7EX Real-Sound, which is also reviewed this month and also uses a class-D output stage, the M22 didnt interfere with FM radio reception in my test lab.          ',\n",
       " '  Pass Labs INT-150, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . Before doing the testing, I ran the INT-150 at one-third its rated power for 60 minutes, which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-A/B output stage. At the end of that period, the heatsinks along the chassis sides were way too hot to touch. This amplifier needs plenty of ventilation.The maximum gain at 1kHz was basically to specification, at 26.4dB into 8 ohms for both balanced and unbalanced inputs. These inputs were noninverting, assessed at both the loudspeaker jacks and the preamplifier outputs, and the XLR jacks appear to be wired with pin 2 hot. The single-ended input impedance was, at 42k ohms, twice the specified  ure at low and midrange frequencies, dropping slightly to 33k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was twice these values, as expected. The balanced preamplifier outputs offered a source impedance of 129 ohms over most of the audioband, rising to 426 ohms at 20Hz. There was a slight   insertion loss from these outputs, ie, a 1V input resulted in an output at the preamp jacks of 920mV.The INT-150s output impedance at the speaker terminals was a fairly low 0.12 ohm in the bass and midrange, rising slightly to 0.16 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the frequency-response modification due to the interaction between this impedance and the way a speakers impedance varies with frequency was mild, at ±0.1dB  . The Passs output is flat almost down to the 10Hz LF limit of this graph; at the other end of the spectrum the response is –0.1dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 125kHz. This wide bandwidth results in an excellent 10kHz square waveform, with short risetimes but no overshoot or ringing  . These graphs were taken with the volume control at its maximum setting, \"63\"; commendably, reducing the setting to an indicated \"40\" didnt change the amplifiers bandwidth. The volume control operated in accurate 1dB steps. The front-panel volume control, which is actually a rotary shaft encoder, worked perfectly throughout my testing, so I am not sure why it failed during ELs auditioning.Fig.1 Pass Labs INT-150, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Pass Labs INT-150, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 2kHz, and still 90dB at 20kHz. The INT-150 was also very quiet. With the volume control at \"63\" but the input shorted, the wideband signal/noise ratio was 79.8dB in the left channel and 76.3dB in the right, ref. 1W into 8 ohms. Switching in an A-weighting filter increased these  ures to 85 and 80dB, respectively.Specified as delivering 150Wpc into 8 ohms at 1% THD  , the INT-150 proved more powerful than that on my test bench, giving 191W into 8 ohms   at this distortion level with both channels driven  . It output 284Wpc into 4 ohms  , but only 225W into 2 ohms   with one channel driven. With both channels driven into 2 ohms, the rear-panel 4A fuse blew after just 15 seconds of continuous running at powers greater than 100W.Fig.3 Pass Labs INT-150, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.The shape of the traces in  .3 reveals that the THD+noise percentage is dominated by noise below 8W or so. I therefore measured how the distortion changed with frequency at a level of 10V, equivalent to 12.5W into 8 ohms  , 25W into 4 ohms  , and 50W into 2 ohms  . The right channel is not quite as linear as the left, but the INT-150 still offers uniformly low distortion below 1kHz into all loads. The THD rises in the top octaves, due to the usual reduction in open-loop gain margin at high frequencies, and the amplifier is starting to be stressed a little above 10kHz into 2 ohms.Fig.4 Pass Labs INT-150, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Into 8 ohms at moderate powers, the distortion is primarily the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  , but higher-order harmonics appear at higher powers and into lower impedances  . The third harmonic remains the highest in level, but at even higher powers, some odd-order harmonics of the AC power supply can be seen  . I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the test system, including floating the AC cord and running a separate connection from the systems chassis ground to the grounding post on the amplifiers rear panel, but there was no significant change in this behavior.Fig.5 Pass Labs INT-150, 1kHz waveform at 14W into 8 ohms  , 0.0049% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Pass Labs INT-150, 1kHz waveform at 27W into 4 ohms  , 0.0099% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Pass Labs INT-150, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 55Wpc into 4 ohms  .The circuits less-good linearity at high frequencies doesnt result in any significant second-order intermodulation product with the demanding high-power mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones, the 1kHz difference component lying at almost –100dB  . However, the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz are almost 40dB higher in level  .Fig.8 Pass Labs INT-150, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .As I have come to expect from a Nelson Pass design, the INT-150 offers excellent measured performance in most respects.           ',\n",
       " 'Prior to measuring the Pass Labs INT-25  ,   it for an hour at one-third power into 8 ohms. At the end of that time, the heatsinks on the amplifiers sides were hot, at 122°F  , as was the top panel, at 116.6°F  . Owners should make sure this amplifier is well-ventilated. The amplifiers maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was 25.4dB, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  .The Pass Labs input impedance is specified as 47k ohms; I measured 46k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 37k ohms at 20kHz. The small reduction at the top of the audioband will be inconsequential. The output impedance was very low, at 0.06 ohms at low and middle frequencies, rising very slightly to 0.08 ohms at the top of the audioband.   Consequently, the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was minimal. The response into impedances of 4 and 8 ohms   was flat up to 20kHz, and the output into 2 ohms   was down by just 0.25dB at 20kHz. The ultrasonic rolloff varied with the load impedance; the –3dB point was close to 200kHz into higher impedances but dropped to 100kHz into 2 ohms. The traces in  .1 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum. Commendably, the frequency response didnt change at lower settings of the volume control, and the already good channel matching improved. The Pass Labs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   featured very short risetimes and no ringing, though there was a very slight hint of overshoot.Fig.1 Pass Labs INT-25, frequency response at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Pass Labs INT-25, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was very good, but asymmetrical at >77dB, R–L, and >90dB, L–R, below 1kHz. Both  ures dropped to close to 60dB at the top of the audioband, however. The wide-band, unweighted S/N ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the volume control set to its maximum and the input shorted to ground, was 75.1dB  , which improved to 83.2dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 86.9dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the INT-25s noise floor   revealed a low level of random noise, but spuriae related to the power-line frequency were present at low levels. The 60Hz component, which will be due to magnetic interference from the power transformer, was highest in level, at –76dB.Fig.3 Pass Labs INT-25, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The INT-25s output power is specified as 25W into 8 ohms and 50W into 4 ohms, both equivalent to 14dBW, with a \"class-A envelope\" of 50W peak into 2, 4, or 8 ohm loads. With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%, I found that the Pass Labs amplifier with both channels driven at 1kHz clipped at 60W into 8 ohms   and 98W into 4 ohms  . Fig.6 shows how the INT-25s THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a moderate output voltage of 8.95V, which is equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms, 20W into 4 ohms, and 40W into 2 ohms. While the Pass Labs offered very low distortion at all frequencies into 8 ohms  , with only a small increase at the top of the audioband, the distortion at this output level increased dramatically above the midrange into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms  . It is possible that this behavior is associated with the amplifiers output stage moving out of the class-A bias condition.Fig.4 Pass Labs INT-25, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Pass Labs INT-25, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Pass Labs INT-25, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.95V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The waveform of the residual distortion and noise with a 1kHz signal at this voltage into 8 ohms   is dominated by the subjectively benign second harmonic. This was confirmed by spectral analysis  , though it is appropriate to note that the second harmonic lies at a very low –86dB  . Higher-order harmonics are virtually absent, though the low-level power supply–related spuriae can be seen in this graph. Both high-order intermodulation products and the second-order difference product with the INT-25 driving an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 10W into 8 ohms were very low in level  . However, as expected from  .6, repeating this test at the same output voltage into 4 ohms produced high levels of intermodulation distortion. I had to reduce the peak output level to 6.32V into 4 ohms, equivalent to 10W into this load, to get a similar spectrum to that shown in  .9.Fig.7 Pass Labs INT-25, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.0092% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Pass Labs INT-25, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Pass Labs INT-25, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms  .There is much to admire in the Pass Labs INT-25s measured performance. However, its intolerance in the treble for loads of 4 ohms and below means it will work best with loudspeakers whose impedance doesnt drop below 8 ohms at high frequencies.           ',\n",
       " '  Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0    .  s, I ran it at one-third its specified clipping power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time, both the top panel and the perforated side panels were warm, at 106.4°F  ; the gain at the speaker terminals was 25.1dB for both the balanced and single-ended inputs—slightly below the specified 26dB; and the output inverted absolute polarity with both inputs.The Constellation amplifiers input impedance at low and middle frequencies was extremely high, at >1M ohm balanced and >310k ohms unbalanced.   The impedances dropped to a still-high 690k and 130k ohms, respectively, at the top of the audioband. I was puzzled by this, as the specified impedances are 20k ohms, balanced, and 10k ohms, unbalanced. Perhaps the circuit was changed after the specifications were published, but a very high input impedance is in no way a problem.The output impedance was low, varying from 0.11 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz to 0.12 ohm at 20kHz. Measured into our standard simulated loudspeaker, the Inspirations frequency response varied by only ±0.1dB  . Fig.1 also shows that the response was flat to 20kHz with all load impedances, but that the ultrasonic output increasingly rolled off above 20kHz as the load impedance dropped. Into 8 ohms   the output was down by just 1.3dB at 200kHz; a 10kHz squarewave in to that load was therefore reproduced with very short risetimes  , though a slight hint of overshoot was present on the waveforms leading edges.Fig.1 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was excellent, at 115dB at 100Hz, though it decreased with increasing frequency, to 72dB at 20kHz. The Inspiration was also very quiet, its unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms and assessed with the unbalanced input shorted to ground, measuring a superb 88dB  . Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved the ratio to 95.2dB, and A-weighting the measurement further improved it, to 98.1dB. Spectral analysis of the Stereo 1.0s low-frequency noise floor   indicated that while some spuriae were present at the AC supply frequency and its harmonics, these were all at or below –105dB in the left channel  , and mostly lower than that in the right channel  .Fig.3 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Inspiration Stereo 1.0 is specified as delivering 200Wpc into 8 ohms or 400Wpc into 4 ohms   at 1% THD+noise. Figs. 4 and 5 respectively plot its percentage of THD+N against power into 8 and 4 ohms, and reveal that at 1% THD+N with both channels driven, the amplifier delivers more power than specified: 340W into 8 ohms   and 480W into 4 ohms  . I tried repeating this test into 2 ohms, with just the left channel, but the Stereo 1.0 turned itself off before the THD+N reached 1%. When I turned it back on, only the right channel was operating, which suggests that one of the internal high-voltage fuses had blown. I could see no way to get inside the chassis to replace the fuse and the manual strongly advises leaving fuse replacement to the dealer.Fig.4 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fortunately, I had by then performed almost all of my tests, other than examining how the Constellations THD+N percentage varied with frequency. I thus performed that test with just the right channel operating  , and at a level high enough that I could be certain I was examining distortion rather than noise: 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. Fig.6 reveals that the Constellation offered very low distortion into 8 ohms  , slightly higher distortion into 4 ohms  , but about 10 times as much THD+N into 2 ohms  . There is the usual rise in THD+N in the top two audio octaves, but still only to levels that are respectably low. As well as being very low in level, the distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  , though at very high powers into 4 ohms the third harmonic is joined by lower levels of second and fifth harmonics  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, with the peak signal level reaching 200W into 4 ohms, the increase in THD+N seen in the top octaves in  .6 results in quite a few intermodulation products  —but of these, the highest in level are still at only –86dB  , and the potentially audible product at 1kHz lies almost 100dB down.Fig.6 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, right channel, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0029% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Overall, the Constellation Inspiration Stereo 1.0 offers quite respectable measured performance, and delivers considerably more power than its conservative specification claims.

       " '  Audio Research VSi60s measured performance with Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. I checked the bias of each output tube after letting the amplifier warm up for an hour and before I did any testing. All the tubes had exactly 60mV of bias, as specified, and didnt need adjustment with the top-panel potentiometers, which suggests good stability.I had one mishap during the testing: I was measuring the amplifiers clipping power from the 4 ohm output transformer tap into 16 ohms and, just as the waveform squared, there was a loud bang. I immediately pulled out the AC lead and took the cover off. The 100 ohm wire-wound plate resistor for one of the left channels 6550 output tubes had exploded. No fuses had blown! The other channel was okay, as was the same tubes 1 ohm cathode resistor. Audio Research sent me a replacement tube and resistor, which I installed  , though not to the same standard of neat soldering typical of the Minnesota companys products. The repaired left channel measured the same as the undamaged right channel, and offered the same signal/noise ratio as it had before the accident. I continued with the remaining tests, the harmonic and intermodulation spectra.The VSi60 offered a maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms of 32.65dB from the 8 ohm tap, and 29.9dB from the 4 ohm tap. Though these gains are lower than usual for an integrated amplifier, in my opinion theyre optimal for CD sources. The unity-gain setting of the volume control was between the third and fourth green LEDs on the front-panel thermometer display. The VSi60 preserved absolute polarity   through all the inputs and from both output taps. Its input impedance was usefully high, at 51k ohms, in the midrange and below, decreasing slightly, to 37k ohms, at 20kHz. The subwoofer output appeared to be full-range, meaning that it should be used with a subwoofer that has its own low-pass input filter.As expected for an amplifier using a single pair of 6550 tubes per channel, the output impedance was moderately high in the bass and midrange, at 2.5 ohms from the 8 ohm tap and 1.6 ohms from the 4 ohm tap. The impedance rose at 20kHz, to 3 and 2.16 ohms, from the 8 and 4 ohm taps, respectively. This highish source impedance gave rise to ±1.4dB response variations from the 8 ohm tap into the magazines standard simulated loudspeaker  , while the increase in source impedance at high frequencies resulted in a premature top-octave rolloff of –2dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . The responses from the 4 ohm tap were similar, but with less variation in response due to different load impedances, as expected  .Fig.1 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , volume control maximum.  Fig.2 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , volume control maximum.  If you look closely at the traces in  .1, you can see a slight knee at 50kHz. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; at lower settings of the volume control, the knee became a little more pronounced  , which implies the existence of some sort of parasitic resonance, which in turn results in a couple of cycles of well-damped ringing on the tops and bottoms of a 10kHz squarewave  . The 4 ohm tap was better behaved in this respect. The amplifiers reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave was superbly square  .Fig.3 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with volume control at 12:00   and at its maximum  .  Fig.4 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 2kHz and still 78dB at 20kHz. The amplifiers noise floor, assessed with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum, was also fairly low in level. The unweighted, wideband S/N ratio   was a good 73.3 and 74.8dB for both channels from the 8 and 4 ohm taps, respectively. The audioband ratios were 5 and 3dB better, while A-weighting the measurement gave 89dB from the 8 ohm tap and 90dB from the 4 ohm tap.Plotting the THD+noise percentage in the VSi60s output against power revealed that the distortion began to rise above the noise floor at levels above 1–2W from the 8 ohm tap  , and at levels above 500mW–1W from the 4 ohm tap  . The linear increase above those levels before actual waveform clipping suggests that the circuit uses a low amount of loop negative feedback  . ARC specifies the VSi60s maximum power at 1.5% THD. The amplifier exceeds that specification from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms, with 53Wpc available   at 1% THD, though only 44W   were available from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms at 1% THD. The amplifier did meet its 50W specification   from the 4 ohm tap at 6% THD; however, the 0.6dB shortfall in power will be inconsequential.Fig.6 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 16, 8, 4 ohms.Fig.7 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 16, 8, 4, 2 ohms.Provided the speaker load is equal to or greater than the nominal value of the VSi60s output transformer tap, the distortion at a level equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms remains below 0.1% in the midrange and below  , though with a rise in THD in the upper audio octaves. The distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous low-order harmonics, even at moderate power levels  . However,  .11 indicates that the amplifiers power supply is working hard, with the fundamental and third-order harmonics of the 60Hz AC power frequency almost as high in level as the distortion harmonics, particularly in the right channel  . The 120Hz component lies at –96dB in this graph  , suggesting that the circuit benefits from optimal grounding.Fig.8 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 6.3V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.9 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 3.9V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.10 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 13.7W into 4 ohms  , 0.175% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .These odd-order power-supply harmonics led to sidebands to either side of the two signal components in the spectrum of the VSi60s output while it reproduced an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level close to visual clipping on the oscilloscope screen  . As anticipated from the circuits decreasing linearity in the top audio octave, the 1kHz difference tone in this graph is moderately high in level, at –60dB  , and reaches –50dB   at 19W peak from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . The higher-order intermodulation products are all lower in level, however.Fig.12 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 25W peak into 8 ohms  .To a large extent, the Audio Research VSi60s measurements are much as I would have expected from a tube amplifier using a single pair of 6550 output tubes per channel, with low loop negative feedback, and offering the sizes of power supply and output transformers that are possible at its price. But its nicely engineered for all that. Just make sure you use the appropriate output transformer tap for your loudspeakers.           ',\n",
       " '  Octave Audio V 80 SE using my top-of-the-line   system  . Measurements were taken with the Octaves rear-panel switch set to High Power, as recommended for the KT150 output-stage tubes.   After warming up the amplifier for an hour, I checked the bias for each of the four output tubes, using the central LED array and the right-hand rotary switch on the front panel. All tubes were correctly biased for KT150s, with the red and green LEDs illuminated for each tube.The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 38.75dB for both the unbalanced and balanced inputs. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLRs being wired with pin 2 hot. When I switched the amplifier to Extern mode, which separates the V 80 SEs preamplifier and power-amplifier sections, the gain at the preamplifier output jacks was 0dB rather than the specified 12dB; ie, all the voltage gain was being supplied by the power-amplifier stage, which also includes the volume control. At the rear-panel headphone jack, the maximum gain was 24.6dB. The balanced input impedance was a high 26k ohms across the audioband; the unbalanced input impedance was 39k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 33k ohms at 20kHz.The preamplifier sections output impedance was a low 5 ohms across the audioband; that from the headphone jack was 19 ohms, which will be too high for low-impedance phones. Measured at the speaker terminals, the output impedance was fairly high, measuring 1.84 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 3.1 ohms at 20kHz. As a result, the variation in the V 80 SEs frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was ±1.1dB  . The other traces in this graph show the response into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. Note the excellent matching between channels but also the slight peak just above 40kHz. With a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  , this peak correlates with a small degree of overshoot on the waveforms leading edges, followed by a single cycle of damped ringing. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; there was no difference in response at lower settings, and the excellent channel balance was preserved. From the headphone output, the frequency response was flat to 30kHz, and down by 3dB at 140kHz  .Fig.1 Octave Audio V 80 SE, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Octave Audio V 80 SE, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was good rather than great, at 69dB R–L and 74dB L–R at 2kHz, decreasing to 48 and 57dB, respectively, at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum—the worst-case situation—was very good, at 79.1dB left and 78.25dB right. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these ratios to 82.6 and 81.7dB, respectively, while switching in an A-weighting filter gave respective ratios of 87.3 and 87.9dB. Fig.3 shows the low-frequency spectrum of the V 80 SEs output as it drove a 1kHz sinewave at 1W into 8 ohms. AC-supply–related components can be seen in both channels, though all the spuriae lie at a low level in absolute terms, and the 120Hz-related components are lower in the left channel than in the right.Fig.3 Octave Audio V 80 SE, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 4 and 5 show how the THD+noise percentage in the V 80 SEs output varied with power into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. Octave specifies the maximum power into 4 ohms with KT150 tubes as 120Wpc  , and  .5 reveals that, with both channels operating, the amplifier just reached this power at 3% distortion. At our usual definition of clipping  , the amplifier gave 43.3Wpc into 4 ohms   and 79Wpc into 8 ohms  . Though the THD+N is very low below 1W into either load, the steady rise in THD with power in both graphs suggests that only a modest degree of loop negative feedback is used. The headphone output clipped at 9V into 300 ohms, which will be more than sufficient drive capability with typical high-impedance cans.Fig.4 Octave Audio V 80 SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms  .Fig.5 Octave Audio V 80 SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms  .I didnt test the Octave amplifiers clipping power into 2 ohms, as the V 80 SE was not comfortable driving a load that low. This can be seen in  .6, which shows how the THD+N percentage varies with frequency: at 6.33V, which is equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms  , 10W into 4 ohms  , and 20W into 2 ohms  . However, into higher impedances, the rise in THD at low frequencies is modest, implying that the V 80 SEs output transformer has a hefty core. The rise in THD at the other end of the audioband is also relatively modest for a push-pull amplifier with a single pair of output tubes and limited loop negative feedback.Fig.6 Octave Audio V 80 SE, THD+N   vs frequency at 6.33V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the nature of the distortion is heavily third-harmonic  , which will be relatively innocuous. At low frequencies at moderate powers, the second harmonic is almost as high as the third  : the second lies at –60dB  , the third at –54dB  . At moderate powers, the V 80 SE produced a low level of intermodulation products when driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones  , the 1kHz difference product lying at –69dB  ; still, the higher-order products are higher in level, particularly in the left channel  .Fig.7 Octave Audio V 80 SE, 1kHz waveform at 8W into 8 ohms  , 0.206% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Octave Audio V 80 SE, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 8W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Octave Audio V 80 SE, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 8W peak into 8 ohms  .Although the rear-panel phono input jacks were marked \"MC Phono,\" our review sample of the V 80 SE was fitted with a moving-magnet stage. The gain at 1kHz, measured at the preamplifier output jacks  , was appropriate for MM cartridges at 40.4dB, as was the input impedance, which ranged from 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz to 21.5k ohms at 20kHz. The phono stage preserved absolute polarity. The RIAA error is shown in  .10; the two channels match closely, but there is a small peak 0.75dB high between 30 and 40Hz before the output rapidly rolls off, reaching –3dB at 18Hz. At the other end of the spectrum, the response is down by 3dB at 63kHz.Fig.10 Octave Audio V 80 SE, phono-stage response with RIAA correction    .Channel separation via the phono input   was very good, at 80dB R–L and 90dB L–R at 2kHz, decreasing to 65 and 60dB, respectively, at 20kHz. The phono signal/noise ratios were also very good, at 70dB  , 75dB  , and 82.4dB  , all ref.1kHz at 5mV and taken with the inputs shorted to ground.The Octaves phono stage also featured very low distortion.  spectrum with a 1kHz tone at 20mV input, 12dB higher than the standard MM level of 5mV and equivalent to an output at the preamplifier jacks of 2V. Even so, as can be seen in  .11, the only distortion harmonic that can be seen above the low noise floor is the second, at –110dB  ! Intermodulation distortion   was higher in level; nevertheless, the difference product at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lay at –66dB  . The phono overload margins, ref. 1kHz at 5mV, were superb, at 28dB at 20Hz, 26dB at 1kHz, and still 14dB at 20kHz.Fig.11 Octave Audio V 80 SE, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 2V into 100k ohms  .As I was with the other Octave Audio amplifiers we have reviewed  , I was impressed by the V 80 SEs measured performance.

       " '  First Watt J2,    .  ,   J2 by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour.   At the end of the hour, the heatsinks were hot, at 125.6°F  , though the top panel was a little cooler, at 113.3°F  .The First Watts voltage gain into 8 ohms measured a lower-than-average 19.5dB from both its balanced and unbalanced inputs, and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The unbalanced input impedance measured the specified 100k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still high 65k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was a consistent 208k ohms across the audioband.The output impedance was relatively high for a solid-state design, at 0.5 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±0.35dB  . This graph, taken with a balanced input  , shows that the audioband response is flat into 8 ohms  , with the ultrasonic rolloff reaching –1.5dB at 100kHz. The response rolled off a little earlier with lower impedances, but even into 2 ohms, the response was down by just 0.25dB at 20kHz  . The J2 reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with short risetimes, and no overshoot or ringing  .Fig.1 First Watt J2, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 First Watt J2, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 3kHz, and still 80dB at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the input shorted to ground, was a respectable 84.1dB  , which improved to 88.3dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 99.75dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the J2s noise floor   revealed spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics, which will be due to a non-zero impedance to ground; and at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, which will be due to magnetic interference from the AC power transformer. All of these spuriae are very low in level, however, and will not be audible.Fig.3 First Watt J2, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%,  .4 reveals that the J2 clipped at 25Wpc into 8 ohms  , with a gentle rise in THD+N below that power. Unusually, but as specified, the J2 delivers less power into 4 ohms  , clipping at 12.5Wpc  . In general, while the First Watt offers low levels of distortion into 8 ohms, it is less comfortable into lower impedance. This is shown graphically in  .6, which plots the percentage of THD+N into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .Fig.4 First Watt J2, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 First Watt J2, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 First Watt J2, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, and as specified by the J2s designer, Nelson Pass, its distortion into higher impedances is primarily the sonically benign second harmonic  , though the third harmonic becomes stronger into 4 ohms, and is accompanied in the left channel by some higher odd-order harmonics  . Intermodulation distortion into higher impedances was also low  , with the second-order difference component at 1kHz lying at –74dB  . Into 4 ohms, this component rose by 10dB to 0.06%  —but again, the left channel   appears less linear than the right   into this lower impedance, with higher levels of higher-order intermodulation products.Fig.7 First Watt J2, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.035% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 First Watt J2, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 First Watt J2, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 First Watt J2, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 First Watt J2, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 2W peak into 4 ohms  .Other than the slightly worse linearity of the left channel into lower impedances, the First Watt J2 measured well. But its measured performance does suggest that owners not use it with speakers that drop below 4 ohms. But as HR found, with higher-impedance speakers, the J2 will sing!           ',\n",
       " 'I initially measured one of the Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression Mono monoblocks      .   of a power amplifier, I precondition it by running it at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes. This power level results in the highest thermal stress on the output devices of an amplifier having a class-B or class-AB output stage. After an hour driving 167W into 8 ohms, the temperature of the Progressions top panel and heatsinks was fairly high, at 109.8°F  . With the amplifier cold, the THD+noise at this power level was 0.04%; after the hour, it had dropped to 0.025%.The voltage gain into 8 ohms for the balanced input was 29.7dB, and the input preserved absolute polarity, the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was as specified, at 100k ohms, though it dropped inconsequentially at 20kHz, to 70k ohms. The output impedance was high for a solid-state design, at 0.44 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.49 ohm at 20kHz. Consequently, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±0.3dB  . The amplifier offered a wide small-signal bandwidth, the output into 8 ohms   not reaching –3dB until 180kHz. Consequently, the Progressions reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured very short risetimes with, commendably, no overshoot or ringing apparent.Fig.1 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W   and at 100W   into 8 ohms  .Measured with the input shorted to ground, the Progression offered a wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio of 57.5dB, ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This was primarily due to the presence of noise with a center frequency of 923kHz. Concerned that the amplifier was picking up some RF interference that was being demodulated, I turned off all the CFC and LED lights in my test lab, but the noise persisted. The ratio improved to 80.1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 87dB when the reading was A-weighted. The blue trace in  .3, taken at 1W into 8 ohms, reveals that the primary source of noise is magnetic interference at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, presumably stemming from that massive toroidal transformer. However, at higher powers  , the spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics increase in level.When I measured how the percentage of THD+N varies with output power into 8 ohms and 4 ohms, I got lower power than specified. With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+N reaches 1%, the Progression clipped at 460W into 8 ohms  , which is 0.4dB lower than the specified 500W, and 690W into 4 ohms  , this 1.6dB lower than the specified 1kW into this load. When I tried to test the clipping power into 2 ohms, the amplifier turned itself off at 750W and just before then, I could hear the amplifier acoustically buzzing, and a burst of static through the FM radio I keep tuned to NPR in the test lab.When Dan DAgostino received the initial preprint of this review, he was concerned that this behavior indicated that the amplifier had suffered some sort of damage on its way to me from Jason Serinus.   I was therefore sent a new sample of the Progression Mono  , which had been fully checked out on the test bench, to test.The voltage gain, input impedance, and frequency response of this sample were identical to those of the first, though the output impedance was slightly lower, at 0.32 ohms, and there was no RF noise present at the amplifiers output. And when I examined how the percentage of THD+N varies with output power, this sample clipped at 595W into 8 ohms  , which is 0.8dB higher than the 500W specification. Into 4 ohms, the clipping power was 934W  ; though this is 0.3dB lower than the specification, I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests, feeling that this is more representative of an amplifiers behavior in a typical system. The wall voltage was 120.1V with the amplifier idling, but had dropped to 115.4V at 934W into 4 ohms.Fig.4 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I examined how the THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a fairly high level, 28.3V, which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms and 200W into 4 ohms.   The results are shown in  .6: the distortion and noise remain low over most of the audioband, with only relatively small rises in the top octave and into lower impedances. However, when  waveform of the THD+N after notching out the fundamental  , I was surprised. Although the THD+N is low in this graph, at 0.027%, you can see a double spike in the residual waveform   that coincides with every zero-crossing point in the signals waveform  . This behavior suggests that the Progressions output stage lacks sufficient bias current, something that I find surprising given Dan DAgostinos history of designing amplifiers with high, even class-A bias.Fig.6 Dan DAgostino Progression, THD+N   vs frequency at 28.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.027% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 100W into 8 ohms; a regular series of high-order harmonics can be seen, correlating with the waveform of the spuriae shown in  .7. The second and third harmonics are similar in strength in this graph, respectively lying at –76dB   and –80dB  . The harmonic spectrum was almost identical with the amplifier driving 50Hz into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Although the THD+N percentage didnt rise by a great deal at high frequencies, the Progression performed relatively poorly when  spectrum of its output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 100W  . While it is true that none of the intermodulation products is particularly high in level—the difference product at 1kHz lies at a respectable –80dB  —an alarming number of higher-order intermodulation products is visible in this graph. These all disappeared, however, when I reduced the peak level to 1W  .Fig.9 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms  .The Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression Mono is a powerful amplifier indeed, and the measured performance of the second sample does suggest that the first sample I received had somehow suffered during its travels. I was still puzzled by what appeared to be crossover distortion. However, it is fair to note that the Progression Mono measured very similarly to Dan DAgostinos more expensive Momentum monoblock, which Michael Fremer very favorably reviewed in February 2013 and which I declared to be \"well-engineered.\"           ',\n",
       " '  Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain.The VK-55SE has four output terminals for each channel, various pairs of which can be used to provide a feed from three different output-transformer taps: these are labeled \"High  ,\" \"Med  ,\" and \"Low  .\" I performed a complete set of measurements from each tap, but have concentrated on the High and Low outputs in this discussion, as the Med  output was not that different from the High in most respects.The amplifiers maximum voltage gain was lower than usual, at 24dB into 8 ohms from the High and Med outputs and 23dB from the Low, though there was a little more experimental error in these  ures than usual because of a slight history effect; ie, the actual gain somewhat depended on the signal behavior. When I increased the signal level of a sinewave tone, for example, the level of the output signal drifted down by a few millivolts over a period of several seconds before stabilizing at the new steady-state value. Each output tap was non-inverting  , with pin 2 of the XLR jacks wired hot. The input impedance was very high—a good thing—at 250k ohms at 1kHz, increasing slightly at the frequency extremes.As with the standard VK-55  , the output impedance from the VK-55SEs High and Med taps was high, at 2.7 ohms in the midrange, rising to almost 3 ohms at high and low frequencies. As expected, the output impedance was somewhat lower from the Low tap, at just under 2 ohms at high and midrange frequencies, with only a slight rise, to 2.1 ohms, at 20Hz. As a result of the Ohms Law interaction between the high output impedances with the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, the amplifiers frequency response into this load varied by ±1.7dB from the Med and High taps   and ±1.2dB from the Low tap  . These variations in response will be audible. Into resistive loads, the VK-55SE offered a flat response in the audioband, with excellent channel matching and a wide small-signal bandwidth. Even into 2 ohms  , the ultrasonic response didnt reach –3dB until 90kHz, which results in a very square squarewave response  . The waveforms risetimes are very short and, commendably, there is only a slight hint of overshoot and no ringing. The VK-55SE uses well-made output transformers.Fig.1 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.3 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was superb at >100dB in both directions below 3kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the input shorted, was good at 78.7dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms, improving to 96.5dB when A-weighted. The  ures were taken from the Low output; the Med and High outputs were about 0.8dB worse.Specified as having a maximum output power of 55Wpc into 8 ohms  , the VK-55SE delivered exactly this power into 8 ohms from its High tap at 1% THD+noise, as can be seen in  .4, which plots the THD+N percentage against output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms from this tap. The 4 ohms delivery was the same, while into 2 ohms, this tap delivered 38W  . The steady rise in THD with power before actual waveform clipping is reached suggests that this amplifier uses only a modest amount of loop negative feedback. The Med tap delivered slightly more power at 1% THD+N into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , but the same 38W into 4 ohms. Fig.5 plots the THD+N percentage against output power from the Low tap. The low-level distortion is lower than from the other two taps, and though less power is available at clipping into 8 ohms—40Wpc, 16dBW—this tap does behave a little more like a voltage source, with 64W available into 4 ohms and 59W into 2 ohms  . The Low tap will be the one to use with loudspeakers that offer an awkward impedance, such as the Thiel CS3.7s used by Wes Phillips for some of his auditioning.Fig.4 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.5 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.The two channels differed in their small-signal linearity and noise level, perhaps because the review samples tubes had much mileage on them. For example,  s. 6 and 7 plot the THD+N percentage against frequency from the High and Low taps, respectively. The right channel   offered lower distortion+noise in the midrange and treble than the left  . However, while the left and right channels were not significantly different at low frequencies from the High tap, the left channel offered significantly less distortion below 100Hz than the right from the Low tap.Fig.6 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .This can be seen in  .8, which shows the spectrum of the VK-55SEs Low-tap output at a modest power into 8 ohms. A regular series of both odd- and even-order harmonics can be seen, but these are each about 12dB lower in the left channel   than the right  . If this spectrum had been predominantly odd-order harmonics, I would have suspected an undersized core in the right-channel transformer, but as the highest-level harmonic is the second, perhaps it was due to a tube mismatch. At higher frequencies and lower levels, the third harmonic dominates  .Fig.8 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, 1kHz waveform at 3.4W into 4 ohms  , 0.248% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Finally, as implied by the fact that the distortion percentage doesnt rise at the top of the audioband in  s. 6 and 7, the VK-55SE did quite well on the demanding twin-tone high-frequency intermodulation test  . At a level from the Low tap just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen, the 1kHz difference tone was the highest in level, at –57dB  , though a series of higher-order products can also be seen at lower levels. The higher-frequency tones were surrounded by sideband pairs at ±120Hz and its harmonics, suggesting that the amplifiers power supply is being stressed under these conditions, even though the actual 120Hz component lies at a low –95dB.  Fig.10 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms  .Overall, the VK-55SE is as well engineered as I have come to expect from Balanced Audio Technology. Certainly it sounds as good as WP describes, as I found out when I drove, from its Low output-transformer tap, the Aerial Model 20Tv2 loudspeakers currently residing in my listening room. But some aspects of the VK-55SEs measured performance bothered me, particularly the difference between the channels low-frequency linearity from the Low tap—and it is only fair to point out that the SE measures no better than the plain-Jane VK-55.           ',\n",
       " 'As mentioned by Wes Phillips, its generous output stage bias causes the NHB-108 to run hot. After the preconditioning period of running at one-third power into 8 ohms, its chassis and heatsink were very hot.  The amplifier is very fussy about how it is used. Turning it on without a load attached blows the 6.3A fast-blo fuses, as does unplugging an input jack. Several times during the testing I inadvertently blew fuses, and got quite proficient in replacing them, even though the fuseholders are hard to reach and manipulate, given their placement inside the chassis adjacent to each power transformer.Unusually, there were DC offsets present on the review samples output terminals. With the NHB-108s input short-circuited, I measured 98.5mV on the left channel, 115mV on the right. The manufacturer hand-trims each amplifier before shipping; as this sample had seen a lot of travel over the past two years, its possible that its DC operating points had gone out of alignment.  I did a complete set of measurements with the NHB-108 set to its Hi condition, with some follow-ups set to Lo. The voltage gain at the Hi and Lo settings was 26.3dB into 8 ohms, absolutely normal, and the amplifier was noninverting; ie, it preserved absolute polarity. The XLR jacks on this sample input were simply connected in parallel with the unbalanced RCA jacks; current production, Im told, has true transformer-coupled balanced inputs in addition to the unbalanced and 50 ohm Zeel inputs. The RCA jacks offered a higher-than-specified input impedance, at 220k ohms at 1kHz, dropping to 110k ohms at 20kHz.   As a result, the NHB-108 will not load down preamplifiers.The NHB-108 lacks overall negative feedback. According to the designer, the only feedback in the input stage is degenerative  , while the output stage is \"full open-loop, with no feedback at all, no emitter resistor, no serial inductance whatsoever.\" A small, local, symmetrical feedback is wrapped around the middle, second stage, but there is no feedback path from the output to the input. Amplifiers lacking overall loop negative feedback can have high output impedances. However, the NHB-108 measured quite well in this regard, the source impedance remaining around 0.34 ohm across the audioband. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms Law interaction between its source impedance and the impedance of our simulated loudspeaker load   stayed within respectable ±0.3dB limits.Fig.1 darTZeel NHB-108, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8 ohms, 4 ohms  .Into resistive loads, the measured small-signal response   revealed a very wide bandwidth, with the amplifiers output down by just 1dB at 148kHz.   As a result, the NHB-108s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was superb, with small risetimes and an absence of overshoot and ringing  .Fig.2 darTZeel NHB-108, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.One thing I noted during the measurements was that after an abrupt change in load impedance, the amplifiers output level continued changing very slightly, settling asymptotically on its new steady-state value. I also noticed this phenomenon with Ayres AX-7 amplifier  , which resembles the darTZeel in not having an overall feedback loop.The darTZeels channel separation was excellent, at 95dB L–R and 100dB R–L. But this is still a higher level of crosstalk than I was expecting from the amplifiers physically dual-mono construction.   Perhaps the need with this early-production sample to connect the two channels speaker ground terminals introduces some small degree of crosstalk. One reason I could see this low level of crosstalk on my oscilloscope screen was because the NHB-108s noise floor was superbly low. Referenced to an output level of 1W into 8 ohms, the A-weighted signal/noise ratio was 91.4dB. Even with a wideband, unweighted measurement, the S/N was 76.5dB.Again due to its lack of loop negative feedback, the NHB-108 is not a low-distortion design. Fig.3 plots the level of THD and noise present in its output   as the output power rises from 100mW to clipping   into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The distortion level at low powers is relatively high and almost doubles with each halving of the load impedance. Even so, the amplifiers linearity remains reasonably constant over a wide range of output power, meaning that the circuits operating conditions will not be modulated by the signal. Clipping occurs quite abruptly, but the amplifier easily exceeds its specified 100Wpc/20dBW output power. I measured 160W into 8 ohms  , 230W into 4 ohms  , but 162W into 2 ohms  . The manufacturer strongly recommends using the Lo setting if the amplifier is to be used with low impedances. However, the amplifier then delivers significantly lower power at clipping—43W into 8 ohms  , 68W into 4 ohms  , and 95W into 2 ohms  —with no reduction in low-power THD.Fig.3 darTZeel NHB-108, Hi setting, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power with one channel driven into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.The distortion, though relatively high, also remained constant with frequency, as can be seen in  .4. Of more subjective importance than the absolute level of distortion present in an amplifiers output is its harmonic spectrum, and here the NHB-108 did well. As can be seen in  .5, the distortion is predominantly low-order harmonics. At low powers, the subjectively benign second harmonic was dominant; at higher powers, the third became dominant  .Fig.4 darTZeel NHB-108, Hi setting, THD+N  vs frequency at 2.83V into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms  .Fig.5 darTZeel NHB-108, Hi setting, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  , 0.165% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 darTZeel NHB-108, Hi setting, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 55W into 8 ohms  .At that point I still had one more measurement to perform, the high-frequency intermodulation test, in which I drive the amplifier being tested with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones and turn up the signal until the amplifier just clips. I then reduce the level by a couple of dB and perform a spectral analysis of the amplifiers output signal, to see what tones are present other than the original 19kHz and 20kHz components under these very demanding conditions.Unfortunately, when I approached clipping with this signal, a click emanated from the NHB-108, which I assume was the crowbar protection circuit cutting in. Before I could reach over and tug the AC cord loose, there was a loud bang from the left-channel output devices and my test lab filled with blue smoke. Once my ears had stopped ringing, it turned out that, when Id last replaced the fuses, I had inadvertently used a slo-blo type for the left channel. When the crowbar circuit operated, the right-channel fast-blo fuse had blown as required, protecting the output stage. Unfortunately, the left channels devices blew up to protect the fuse!The NHB-108s measured performance indicates that, with the exception of its slightly bent transfer function, designer Hervé Delétraz has avoided the problem most commonly associated with the absence of the usual overall negative-feedback loop. But that highish DC level and the hair-trigger crowbar protection make it difficult for me to recommend on a general basis. The darTZeel NHB-108 is like a Shelby Cobra—a handbuilt, high-performance design that makes demands on its always gratified owner, rather than a plugnplay, never-very-gratifying Ford Taurus. But given that caveat, I was impressed by the NHB-108, and my own auditioning echoes that of both Wes Phillips and John Marks: I found it a very sweet-sounding amplifier.           ',\n",
       " 'The VAC Sigma 170i iQ uses two pairs of Gold Lion KT88 tubes for its output stages and eight small-signal tubes. The tubes are identified with a number, this between the pins of the small-signal tubes. The tube locations are clearly indicated in the manual and the top panel has each tube socket marked with the appropriate tube number. I carefully followed the numbering when installing the tubes before connecting the amplifier first to my    , then to the magazines higher-performance APx555 analyzer in order to repeat some of the tests. The condition-monitoring LEDs for the four KT88s remained dark throughout the testing, indicating that these tubes were operating correctly. The output transformer taps are marked \"8–16,\" \"4–8,\" and \"2–4.\" I performed a complete series of tests from each of the three taps using the single-ended line-level inputs then repeated some of the tests using the balanced inputs.The Sigma 170i iQs unbalanced input impedance was a high 44.7k ohms at 20Hz, dropping to a still-high 33k ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was slightly greater than twice the unbalanced impedance across the audioband. The 170i iQ inverted absolute polarity with both sets of inputs from all three transformer taps and from the preamplifier outputs. The amplifiers maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms depended on the output tap. The highest gain was from the 8–16 ohm tap, at 48.1dB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs. The gain from the 4–8 ohm tap was 47.8dB, and from the 2–4 ohm tap it was 46.4dB. These gains are somewhat higher than usually found in integrated amplifiers. The gain at the preamplifier output was 21.6dB, sourced from a low output impedance of 340 ohms at high and middle frequencies but from a high 3154 ohms in the low bass.The amplifiers output impedance depended on the output tap. From the 8–16 ohm tap, the impedance was an extremely high 8.8 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping very slightly to 8 ohms at 20kHz. The VAC amplifier appears to adhere to telecommunications practice, where the output impedance is similar in value to the load impedance. This results in maximum power transfer to the load, but as can be seen from the gray trace in  .1, it also results in large and very audible ±3.5dB variations in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker. The variations in response were reduced to ±2.1dB with the 4–8 ohm tap—which had an output impedance of 4.4 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 4 ohms at 20kHz—and to ±1.2dB from the 2–4 ohm tap  . This tap had an output impedance of 2.2 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 1.95 ohms at 20kHz.Fig.1 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 2–4 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .The small-signal bandwidth is wide and flat to 20kHz into resistive loads from all three transformer taps  , though two ultrasonic resonances can be seen. These were highest in level when the load impedance was lower than the nominal tap value. This behavior is associated with a small amount of overshoot and ringing with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . At lower frequencies, the amplifiers reproduction of squarewaves had flat tops and bottoms, confirming the Sigma 170i iQs extended low frequencies.Fig.3 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum. The channel matching was within 0.2dB and didnt change at lower settings of the volume control. Channel separation was not as good as I expected, at 60dB, L–R, and 68dB, R–L, below 2kHz, and the  ures reduced to 35dB and 49dB, respectively, at the top of the audioband.Measured at the 8–16 ohm taps and taken with the inputs shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 49.9dB   ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 69.2dB, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 76.3dB when A-weighted. The S/N ratios from the 4–8 ohm tap were slightly greater and up to 2dB greater from the 2–4 ohm tap, correlating with the lower gain.With the volume control set to its minimum, the main power supply–related spuriae in the Sigma 170i iQs noise floor were at 60Hz, 120Hz, and 180Hz  , with the highest in level   lying at –72dB ref. 1W from the 8–16 ohm tap into 8 ohms. Peculiarly, with the volume control set to its maximum and the amplifier driving 1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms, sidebands appeared at ±120Hz, ±240Hz, and ±360Hz either side of the peak at 1kHz in this spectrum. I repeated this spectral analysis at lower settings of the volume control and with several different grounding arrangements: floating the amplifiers AC ground; floating the SYS2722s signal generator ground and connecting the analyzers chassis and the VACs chassis with a separate wire; and repeating these conditions with the APx555 system. There was no change in this behavior; it is probably due to a nonzero impedance connection from signal ground to power-supply ground somewhere in the Sigma 170i iQs circuit.Fig.4 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at its maximum   and at its minimum   linear frequency scale).The VAC amplifier is specified as delivering 85Wpc, presumably into 8 ohms  , which is a little higher than I would expect from a push-pull pair of KT88s. Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs THD+noise percentage reaches 1%, the amplifier with both channels driven with a 1kHz signal clipped at 11.8Wpc into 8 ohms   from the 8–16 ohm output transformer tap  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N resulted in a power of 51Wpc into 8 ohms  . The shape of the trace in  .5 suggests that the amplifier is \"soft\" clipping, with the usual sharp \"knee\" in the trace where the waveform squares off occurring at THD+N levels above 3%. Less power was available into 4 ohms from the 8–16 ohm tap, 3% THD+N being reached at 10.75W  .Fig.5 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.From the 4–8 ohm tap, the Sigma 170i iQ reached 1% THD+N at 32.6Wpc into 8 ohms   and 79Wpc   at 3% THD+N  . Less power was available into 4 ohms from this tap: 49Wpc at 3% THD+N  . The 2–4 ohm tap was probably optimal for real loudspeaker loads, reaching 3% THD+N at 53Wpc into 8 ohms  , 75Wpc into 4 ohms  , and 74Wpc into 2 ohms  .Fig.7 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 4–8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.8 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 4–8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.9 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 2–4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The distortion levels in  s.5–8 never drop below 0.1%  ; this will be due in part to the presence of the power-supply noise noted earlier. The lowest distortion I found was with the 2–4 ohm tap driving a load of 8 ohms. This can be seen in  .10, which plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at 6.35V, which is equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms, 10W into 4 ohms, and 20W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was lowest in the low treble into 8 ohms   but rose at higher and lower frequencies and into lower impedances. The left channel   had higher distortion into 4 and 2 ohms than the right  .Fig.10 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 2–4 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 6.35V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The Sigma 170i iQs distortion in the left channel was predominantly the third harmonic  . However, the second harmonic was the highest in the right channel  , though the distortion harmonics in this graph are below the level of the supply-related spuriae. When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 8W into 8 ohms from the 2–4 ohm tap  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB  , though the higher-order intermodulation products were a little higher in level. Repeating this spectral analysis from the 8–16 ohm tap, the 1kHz product rose to –60dB  .Fig.11 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 5W into 8 ohms, 0.35% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 5Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 8Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Turning to the optional phono input, I got the lowest noise by floating the signal generator ground and connecting the Sigma 170i iQs chassis-grounding terminal to the analyzer ground. I primarily tested the VACs phono input from the preamplifier output.The VACs phono stage inverted absolute polarity at all outputs in moving magnet and moving coil modes. The MM input impedance was 53k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 46.5k ohms at 20kHz. In MC mode, with the input impedance set to 470 ohms, I measured 71 ohms at 20Hz, 430 ohms at 1kHz, and 324 ohms at 20kHz. With the input impedance set to 200 ohms, I measured 70 ohms at 20Hz, 183 ohms at 1kHz, and 168 ohms at 20kHz. With the input impedance set to 100 ohms, I measured 60 ohms at 20Hz, 89 ohms at 1kHz, and the same at 20kHz. With the volume control set to its maximum, MM mode offered 56.9dB of gain at the preamplifier output and 81.8dB at the 8–16 ohm loudspeaker output. In MC mode, the maximum gain was 77dB at the preamplifier output and 101.4dB at the 8–16 ohm loudspeaker output. Taking the 21.6dB gain in the preamplifier section into account, these measurements are consistent with the stated phono-section gains of 37dB   and 57dB  .The Sigma 170i iQs RIAA correction offered very low error  , with a slight   boost in the bass before the sharp rolloff that indicates the presence of a subsonic high-pass filter. The RIAA correction was well-matched between the channels. However, there is a slight peak apparent between 50kHz and 100kHz.  Fig.14 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, phono input, MM mode, response with RIAA correction  With the volume control set to its maximum, the phono inputs noise performance in MM mode was good, with unweighted audioband signal/noise ratios   of 49.9dB, left channel, and 55dB, right. These ratios improved by 20dB when A-weighted. The higher gain in the MC mode reduced the S/N ratios, this time ref. 1kHz at 500µV, by around 5dB.The Sigma 170i iQ phono input offered excellent overload margins at 27dB at 1kHz and 20kHz ref. 1kHz at 5mV in MM mode. In MC mode, the overload margin was 26dB at both frequencies ref. 1kHz at 500ÊV. However, the margins were very much lower at 20Hz, at around 3dB in both MM and MC modes. Low-output phono cartridges will work better with the VACs phono stage. The phono inputs distortion was low, primarily consisting of the second harmonic. At an input level 6dB higher than the nominal MM output level of 5mV, this lay at –60dB  . Intermodulation distortion via the VACs phono input was similarly low  .Fig.15 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, phono input, MM mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 10mV input  .Fig.16 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, phono input, MM mode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100mV peak input  .Especially in terms of its output impedance, the VAC 170i iQ resembles other \"classic\" tube-amp designs such as the   PrimaLuna Prologue Premium. A common argument in favor of such designs is that they dont employ feedback to reduce their output impedance, which can have negative sonic consequences. But there are also sonic consequences to such high output impedances. As illustrated in  s.1 and 2, when used from the 4–8 ohm and 8–16 ohm transformer taps, this amplifier will change sonic character with every loudspeaker it is used with.           ',\n",
       " '  Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression M550 monoblock      . I repeated some of the measurements with the magazines Audio Precision APx500 analyzer. Usefully, the box included a set of tests performed with the APx500.Before I performed the testing,   amplifier by running it at one-eighth its specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes, as recommended by the Consumer Electronics Association. After the preconditioning, the M550s top panel was surprisingly cool, at 96.8°F  . The temperature of the massive heatsinks on the amplifiers sides was 101.8°F   and didnt increase significantly with the amplifier idling.The voltage gain into 8 ohms for the balanced input was 29.7dB, and the input inverted absolute polarity, the opposite of what I had found with earlier DAgostino amplifiers  . The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was very slightly lower than the specified 100k ohms, at 95k ohms, dropping inconsequentially to 50k ohms at 20kHz. The output impedance was higher than the specified 0.1 ohm, at 0.37 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.4 ohm at 20kHz. The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker therefore varied by ±0.26dB  . The amplifier offered a wide small-signal bandwidth, the output into 8 ohms   not reaching –3dB until 140kHz. The Progression M550s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   accordingly featured very short risetimes with, commendably, no apparent overshoot or ringing.  Fig.1 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Measured with both phases of the balanced input shorted to ground, the M550s wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio was 55.3dB, ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 80.5dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 89dB when the reading was A-weighted. The blue trace in  .3, taken at 1W into 8 ohms, reveals that the primary source of noise is magnetic interference at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, which I assume stem from the massive toroidal transformer. However, at high powers  , the spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics increase in level.Fig.3 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W   and at 100W   into 8 ohms  .When I examined how the percentage of THD+N varied with output power, with clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the amplifiers output reached 1%, the M550 clipped at 555W into 8 ohms  , which is marginally higher than the specified 550W  . The clipping power into 4 ohms   was 840W  ; though this is 1.17dB lower than the specified 1.1kW, I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests, feeling that this is more representative of an amplifiers behavior in a typical system. The wall voltage was 118.7V with the amplifier idling but had dropped to 115.1V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms. Note from these two graphs that the distortion percentage at low powers is higher than it is at high powers. This behavior was consistent with both Audio Precision analyzers and is almost identical to what I found with the Dan DAgostino Progression Mono amplifier that JVS reviewed in October 2017.Fig.4 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.As with the earlier amplifier, I examined how the THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a high level, 28.3V, which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms, 200W into 4 ohms, and 400W into 2 ohms.   The results are shown in  .6: The distortion and noise remain low over most of the audioband into the higher impedances with only a minuscule rise in the top octave.   However, when  waveform of the THD+N at 100W into 8 ohms after notching out the fundamental  , I saw spikes in the residual waveform   that coincided with the zero-crossing points in the signals waveform  . This behavior indicates the presence of crossover distortion.Fig.6 Dan DAgostino Progression, THD+N   vs frequency at 28.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.062% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 100W into 8 ohms. The subjectively innocuous second harmonic lies at –74dB  , but a regular series of high-order harmonics can be seen, which correlates with the waveform of the spuriae shown in  .7. The harmonic spectrum was very similar with the amplifier driving 50Hz into 4 ohms and 1kHz into 8 ohms at 28.3V  . At 1W into 8 ohms, the second harmonic was still the highest in level but lay at –60dB   and was still accompanied by higher-order harmonics. Fig.9 shows the spectrum of the M550s output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 100W. While the difference product at 1kHz lay at an okay –73dB  , there are also many higher-order intermodulation products visible in this graph.Fig.8 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .The Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression M550 is a powerful amplifier indeed and will not be fazed by being required to drive low-impedance loudspeakers. However, the presence of what appeared to be crossover distortion, which suggests insufficient output-stage bias, is puzzling. Footnote 1: In measuring the Momentum HD preamplifier, I found it inverted polarity, but in a Manufacturers Comment, Dan DAgostino wrote that this was due to an error in the pre-production firmware code that was fixed in all production units.

       " '  First Watt SIT-3,    .  ,   SIT-3 by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time the top panel was warm, at 106.3°F  , and the heatsinks were hot, at 123.8°F  .The First Watts voltage gain into 8 ohms was a very low 11.3dB and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  . The input impedance measured close to the specified 200k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still very high 151k ohms at 20kHz. The output impedance was half that of the First Watt J2, which Herb Reichert reviewed in October 2016, at 0.25 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 0.265 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±0.2dB  . This graph shows that the audioband response is flat up to 10kHz, with a rolloff in the top octave reaching –0.8dB at 20kHz. The SIT-3 reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with short risetimes, and no overshoot or ringing  .Fig.1 First Watt SIT-3, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 First Watt SIT-3, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Like the J2, the SIT-3s channel separation was excellent, measuring >100dB in both directions below 1kHz, and still 74dB at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the input shorted to ground, was an excellent 87.3dB in the left channel and an even greater 95.4dB in the right. These ratios improved to 94.5 and 98.1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 107dB when A-weighted. These high ratios will be related to the low overall gain, of course. Spectral analysis of the SIT-3s noise floor   revealed spuriae both at 120Hz and its harmonics, and at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics; the latter will be due to magnetic interference from the AC power transformer. All of these spuriae are very low in level, however, and will not be audible.Fig.3 First Watt SIT-3, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The SIT-3 is specified as being able to deliver 18Wpc into 8 ohms  . With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%,  .4 indicates that the SIT-3 clipped at 8.4Wpc into 8 ohms  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N, the First Watt clipped at the specified 18Wpc. Into 4 ohms  , the SIT-3 delivered 16.8Wpc   at 1% THD+N, and 36Wpc   at 3%. Figs. 4 and 5 both show that while the distortion is low at very low powers, it rises linearly as the power increases. This is typical for an amplifier with a single-ended output stage.Fig.4 First Watt SIT-3, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 First Watt SIT-3, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The First Watt SIT-3 offered levels of distortion that remained relatively constant with frequency but that increased into lower impedances  . Fortunately, and as specified by First Watts Nelson Pass  , the SIT-3s distortion was predominantly the sonically benign second harmonic, what appears to be the opposite phase to the fundamental, at least regarding the positive-going half cycles  .   Though the third harmonic was present at a level around 15dB lower than that of the second  , it didnt increase in level as the power increased or the impedance dropped  . However, higher-order harmonics became visible when the output reached 5W into 8 ohms and above, as predicted by Nelson Pass  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a low power into 8 ohms, the levels of higher-order intermodulation products were relatively low  , though the second-order difference product lay at –54dB  . Commendably, the levels of these intermodulation products were similar when I kept the output voltage the same and halved the load impedance  .Fig.6 First Watt SIT-3, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 First Watt SIT-3, 1kHz waveform at 1Wpc into 8 ohms, 0.244% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 First Watt SIT-3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 First Watt SIT-3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 First Watt SIT-3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 5Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 First Watt SIT-3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 First Watt SIT-3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 2Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Although that relatively high level of second-harmonic distortion, which is a deliberate design choice, is controversial, the First Watt SIT-3 is a well-engineered amplifier.

       " '  Vinnie Rossi LIO    . With its modular topology, offering optional phono and digital-input stages, the choice between a switched-resistor volume control and an autotransformer volume control, an optional tubed line stage, a headphone amplifier, and a MOSFET power amplifier, the LIO is actually eight products in one and presents a complex target for measurements. I tested most of the con urations fully, with spot checks elsewhere.To minimize strain on the amplifiers output stage,   performance of the phono and D/A modules at the fixed-level outputs with the power-amplifier outputs disabled. The moving-magnet input offered a gain of 34.9dB, the two moving-coil inputs   a gain of 57.75dB, both lower than the respective specified gains of 40 and 60dB. Both MM and MC inputs preserved absolute polarity.The MM input impedance was close to the specified 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, though it dropped to 38k ohms at the top of the audioband. The review sample was fitted with the remotely adjustable input impedance for the MC inputs, which can be adjusted from a maximum value of 2k ohms to 26 ohms. I spot-checked the input impedance at 20Hz, 1kHz, and 20kHz with the impedance set to 99 ohms, 499 ohms, and 2k ohms. However, I got anomalous measurements. Regardless of the setting, the input impedance at 20kHz measured close to 60 ohms; at 20Hz, it was between 200 and 260 ohms. While the MC input impedance did increase or decrease with the setting at 1kHz, I measured 817 ohms at a nominal 2k ohms, 543 ohms at a nominal 499 ohms, and 307 ohms at a nominal 99 ohms. The phono stages output impedance was 1300 ohms at 20Hz, and around 42 ohms in the midrange and above.The MM input featured superbly accurate RIAA de-emphasis, with excellent matching between channels, a wide ultrasonic response, and a gentle low-frequency rolloff of –1dB at 25Hz  . However, the MC inputs had a 5dB peak at 18kHz, with a sharp rolloff above that frequency  . Channel separation was excellent, at >85dB over most of the audioband, and the phono inputs were very quiet, offering signal/noise ratios of around 63dB for both MM and MC stages, measured with those inputs shorted to ground and the measurement bandwidth restricted to the audioband.Fig.1 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Phonostage, response with RIAA correction: MM input  , MC input    .Overload margins at low and middle frequencies were good for both MM and MC inputs, at 19dB   and 17dB  , but the high-frequency overload margin was only okay for the MM input  , and poor for the MC input  . Distortion was a little higher than normal, though predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  . But even at the equivalent MM level of 1kHz at 5mV, high-frequency intermodulation was poor, with the difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at just –33dB  .Fig.2 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Phonostage  , spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 5mV input into 100k ohms  .Fig.3 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Phonostage  , HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50mV input peak into 100k ohms  .Turning to the digital input module,   USB input using my MacBook Pro running on battery power. Apples USB Prober utility identified the module as \"XMOS USB 2.0 Audio Out\" and confirmed that it operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. The TosLink input accepted 24-bit data with sample rates up to 96kHz, the coaxial input 24 bits up to 192kHz, while the USB input accepted 32-bit integer data with sample rates up to 384kHz.Measured at the Fixed preamp output, data representing a 1kHz tone at 0dBFS gave a level of 2.205V. However, measured with the Resistor Volume Control   module set to its maximum, a 1kHz tone at –12dBFS resulted in a level of 10.82V into 8 ohms from the MOSFET amplifier modules outputs. This is very close to the amplifiers clipping point  , so the RVC and the Autoformer Volume Control   each needs to be set well below its maximum level in order to avoid overloading the amplifier module with digital inputs.Figs. 4 and 5 show the impulse responses, at 44.1kHz, of the Linear Phase and Minimum Phase reconstruction filters, respectively, and reveal that each filter performs exactly as advertised. Performing the test first described by MBLs Jürgen Reis—in which the DAC is fed first 44.1kHz data representing a full-scale 19.1kHz tone, then data representing white noise—both filters behaved identically. Fig.6 shows the result of this test with Filter 1, the Linear Phase filter. The noise signal   reveals that the audioband response extends up to more than 20kHz, with then a sharp rolloff, reaching the stopband noise floor at 24kHz. The ultrasonic sampling image of the 19.1kHz tone at 25kHz is suppressed by 110dB, and all the distortion harmonics lie at or below –93dB  .Fig.4 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, Filter 1, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.5 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, Filter 2, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.6 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, Filter 1, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.7 shows the frequency response of the LIOs digital module with sample rates of 44.1, 96, 192, and 384kHz. With all four rates, the response is flat within the audioband, and with the two lower rates it extends almost to half the sample rate before dropping off very sharply. With the two higher rates, the response starts to roll off gently above 50kHz, with the 384kHz ultrasonic response extending slightly higher than that at 192kHz. Again, the two filters behaved identically on this test.Fig.7 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, Filter 1, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fed first 16-bit data, then 24-bit data, each representing a dithered 1kHz tone at exactly –90dBFS, the drop in the noise floor with the increase in bit depth was just over 10dB  , implying resolution of almost 18 bits. This test was performed with TosLink data; I repeated the test with USB data and got identical results, indicating that the USB input does correctly handle hi-rez data. However, I was puzzled by the appearance of very low-level spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics in this graph, given the hefty ultracapacitor power supply, which is charged with 24V DC by the outboard supply.Fig.8 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .The LIO correctly handled 16- and 24-bit undithered data  , and offered low levels of harmonic distortion, with the second harmonic dominant at –80dB  . Intermodulation distortion   was also very low. Tested for its rejection of word-clock jitter, the modules USB input performed very well, as expected. There are no jitter-related sidebands present with 16-bit/44.1kHz J-Test data  , though there is an odd rise in the noise floor either side of the primary tone. This was also present with 24-bit J-Test data. However, with 16- and 24-bit TosLink data, sidebands appeared at ±60, ±120, and ±180Hz  . This, too, puzzled me—there should be no AC-line–related components present at all, given the LIOs massively stiff power supply.Fig.9 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Fig.10 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.11 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 0dBFS into 100k ohms  .Fig.12 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data from MacBook Pro via USB  .

Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.The LIOs headphone-amplifier module follows whichever volume-control option has been fitted, and is connected in parallel with the Variable preamp outputs and the input of the MOSFET amplifier module, if fitted. It offered a maximum gain of 13dB with the AVC and inverted signal polarity. The output impedance was a suitably low 6 ohms at low and middle frequencies, though this rose to 18.5 ohms at 20kHz. Though the audioband response was flat and well matched between channels, I was surprised to find a 10dB peak at 35kHz with the AVC feeding the headphone module  .Fig.14 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Headphone output, Autoformer Volume Control set to \"43\" frequency response at 1V into 600 ohms  .With line-level signals, the AVC module preserved absolute polarity  . Set to its maximum level of \"63,\" the AVC had low input impedances of 4.8 and 7.5k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, respectively, and a very low impedance of just 400 ohms at 20kHz. This last will stress many tubed source components, but fortunately, the input impedance increased at lower settings. With the AVC set to \"43,\" for example, the input impedance measured 92k ohms at 1kHz and 58.5k ohms at 10kHz. The Resistor Volume Control  , set to its maximum of \"63,\" offers unity gain and an input impedance of 28k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping slightly to 21.3k ohms at 20kHz.  behavior of the Tubestage using the RVC module at the Variable preamplifier outputs. It offers an insertion loss of just over 0.7dB; ie, fed 1V at 1kHz, it outputs 921mV, and the module preserved absolute polarity. Its output impedance was a low 53 ohms at 20kHz and 1kHz, though this rose to 1450 ohms at 20Hz. The Tubestage was reasonably linear—with a 50Hz tone at 300mV into 100k ohms, the second harmonic was the highest in level and lay at –64dB  .Fig.15 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Tubestage, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to maximum, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 300mV into 100k ohms  .  MOSFET amplifier module in four setups: 1) with the RVC module and the Tubestage; 2) with the RVC and no Tubestage, using the little bypass module in the latters place; 3) with the AVC, which replaces both the RVC and the Tubestage; and 4) without any volume-control module, which appears to send the selected input signal straight to the amplifier module. The maximum voltage gain at the speaker terminals into 8 ohms varied with each of these conditions: 33.4dB with the AVC, and a significantly lower 25.8dB with and without the RVC or Tubestage. Comparisons among these different volume control modules will be misleading unless the different gains are compensated for.The MOSFET amplifier modules input impedance was a reasonably high 40k ohms. Its output impedance was low, at 0.12 ohm at 20Hz, 0.084 ohm at 1kHz, and 0.086 ohm at 20kHz, which gave a very small variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  . Fig.16, taken with the Tubestage driving the amplifier module and the RVC set to \"63,\" shows excellent channel matching and a wide small-signal bandwidth. However, when I repeated this test with the AVC also set to \"63,\" a 13dB peak at 34kHz appeared. The height of this peak didnt appear to be affected by the volume-control setting, though the frequency increased at lower settings. Fig.17, for example, compares the LIOs overall frequency response, measured at the speaker terminals, with both the RVC and AVC set to \"43.\" The RVCs ultrasonic response   is identical to what it was in  .16, with a –3dB point at 75kHz, while with the AVC, the 13dB peak now lies at 80kHz. The puzzle to me is that this ultrasonic peak with the AVC resulted in no overshoot or ringing with the LIOs squarewave response  . I did wonder if there was some sort of interaction between the AVCs transformers and the input of the Audio Precision test set, but then I remembered that this peak was also evident with the AVC feeding the LIOs headphone module.Fig.16 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.17 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to \"43\"  , Autoformer Volume Control set to \"43\"  : frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms  .Fig.18 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum: small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The amplifier modules channel separation was good, at >90dB between 1 and 3kHz, though it dropped to 64dB at 100Hz and 78dB at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband S/N ratio, measured with the line input shorted and the AVC set to \"63,\" was a good 77.3dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms. This improved to 91.3dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 94.3dB when A-weighted. Again I was puzzled by the appearance of low-level spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics in the amplifiers output when it drove 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  . The AVC was connected for this measurement, and perhaps the transformers were picking up radiated magnetic interference from the computer that runs the Audio Precision software. However, moving the computer made no difference.Fig.19 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum: spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The LIO is specified as being able to deliver 25Wpc into 8 ohms   or 45Wpc into 4 ohms  . However, with our standard definition of clipping being when the THD+noise reaches 1%, the LIO didnt reach those powers under that condition. It clipped at 17Wpc into 8 ohms   and 30Wpc into 4 ohms  . The LIO did meet its specified power into both impedances at 11% THD+N, however. Perhaps more significant is the level of THD+N at lower powers, which is fairly high. These graphs were taken with a signal frequency of 1kHz and the RVC driving the amplifier module; changing to the AVC or adding the Tubestage made no difference. But when I plotted how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a voltage level equivalent to 3Wpc into 8 ohms and 6Wpc into 4 ohms, it appears that the Tubestage itself contributes distortion at high frequencies. Fig.22 shows the variation in THD with the AVC,  .23 with the Tubestage. In both cases, the THD level at moderate powers is high. Fortunately for the sound quality, the distortion is heavily second-harmonic in nature  , though plenty of higher-order harmonics are present, especially at low frequencies  . And given Herb Reicherts positive reaction to the LIOs sound when used as an integrated amplifier with the AVC, it is perhaps not surprising that its high-frequency intermodulation performance in this con uration, measured at a level close to visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope, was not too bad  .Fig.20 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control set to maximum: distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.21 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control set to maximum: distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.22 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum, THD+N  vs frequency at 4.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.23 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to maximum, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.24 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum, 1kHz waveform at 6W into 4 ohms, 0.47% THD+N  : distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.25 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to maximum: spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 3W into 8 ohms  .Fig.26 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum: HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 3W peak into 8 ohms  .Finally, as the LIO is powered by the capacitor supply, it will run only a certain length of time from one bank of capacitors before switching to the other. With the LIO driving 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms and one capacitor bank newly charged, the supply voltage dropped from 22.9 to 19V in exactly three minutes, at which point the LIO automatically switched to the second bank, now freshly charged, with a just-audible click.I was impressed by the concept underlying the Vinnie Rossi LIO, and its physical execution is stunning. But other than the RVC, moving-magnet Phonostage, and Digital modules, all of which offered good to excellent measured performance, there are problems with the other modules that bothered me. Of course, the benefit of the approach adopted by Vinnie Rossi with the LIO is that he can introduce running improvements to individual modules without requiring the owner replace the entire chassis.

       " '  darTZeel NHB-458, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  , I ran it at 1/3 its rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes, which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-A/B output stage. At the end of that period, while the shrouded heatsink on the amplifiers rear was too hot to keep my hand on, at 63.5°C/146°F, the top of the enclosure was only warm, at 40.8°C/107.4°F, according to my infrared thermometer. The THD+noise with the amplifier stone cold was 0.08%; after an hour with the amplifier hot, it had risen slightly, to 0.083%—a much smaller change than I have found with some other solid-state amplifiers.I wasnt able to test the NHB-458 through its impedance-matched 50-ohm Zeel input; I measured its performance using the conventional unbalanced and balanced inputs, selecting each with the front-panel Menu buttons.   As used by Michael Fremer, the amplifiers gain was set to \"32dB\"; via the unbalanced input, the voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 32.05dB. The balanced inputs gain was 6dB lower. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLR being wired with pin 2 hot.The unbalanced input impedance, specified as being >30k ohms, was a usefully high 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 37k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was 20k ohms at all frequencies, as specified. The output impedance was high for a solid-state design, at 0.3 ohm   at all frequencies. Consequently, there was a slight, ±0.25dB variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  , due to the Ohms Law interaction between this impedance and that of the load. The NHB-458s small-signal frequency was otherwise flat within the audioband with all impedances above 2 ohms; the bandwidth into 8 ohms was wide, the response being down by <1dB at 200kHz  . As a result, the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured very short risetimes  , with no trace of overshoot or ringing. Good stuff!Fig.1 darTZeel NHB-458, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .The darTZeel amplifier was quiet, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   measuring 81.4dB with the RCA input jack shorted to ground. Switching an A-weighting filter into circuit increased the ratio to 92.4dB, as the noise predominantly comprised low levels of the 60Hz AC supply frequency  , perhaps partly due to magnetic interference from the massive toroidal transformer that is the amplifiers heart.Fig.2 darTZeel NHB-458, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 darTZeel NHB-458, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 4, 5, and 6 show how the THD+N percentage changes with output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms, respectively, taken from the unbalanced input. This is a powerful amplifier. Defining the clipping point as the power when the THD+N reaches 1%, the NHB-458 clips at 530W into 8 ohms  , 900W into 4 ohms  , and 1025W into 2 ohms  .   Usually with a solid-state amplifier, the shapes of the traces in  s. 4, 5, and 6 would indicate that the THD+N reading was dominated by noise at low powers, with the actual distortion rising out of the noise floor at each traces inflection point. But the NHB-458 is a very quiet amplifier, and these traces reveal that the distortion is, very unusually, higher at lower powers than at higher powers, at least until the amplifier starts to clip. I would have suspected crossover distortion due to a lack of output-stage bias current, except that crossover distortion comprises subjectively irritating high-order harmonics—and, as you will see, the NHB-458s distortion spectrum is dominated by low-order harmonics.Fig.4 darTZeel NHB-458, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 darTZeel NHB-458, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 darTZeel NHB-458, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.To ensure that noise didnt affect the measurement, I examined how the darTZeels THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a fairly high voltage, 12.67V  . The results are shown in  .7; while the THD roughly doubles with each halving of the load impedance, it remains constant at all frequencies, which is something I conjecture correlates with good sound quality, provided the spectrum of the distortion consists of low-order harmonics. Which the NHB-458s distortion spectrum does: Fig.8 indicates that it primarily consists of the subjectively innocuous second and third harmonics. This graph was taken at a low power; at high powers, higher-order harmonics can be seen  , though the spectrum doesnt change significantly when a 4 ohm load   is substituted for 8 ohms  , other than an increase in the third harmonic. Despite the higher-than-usual harmonic distortion, the NHB-458 did relatively well on the high-power, high-frequency intermodulation test  . While the difference component at 1kHz lies at –64dB  , all the higher-order intermodulation products lie below that level.Fig.7 darTZeel NHB-458, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.67V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 darTZeel NHB-458, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 4 ohms  , 0.187% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 darTZeel NHB-458, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at: 150W into 8 ohms  , 300W into 4 ohms    .Fig.10 darTZeel NHB-458, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Its measured performance reveals that darTZeels NHB-458 offers extremely wide dynamic range capability. While its distortion is not as low as is usually found in modern solid-state designs, perhaps of greater importance is the fact that that distortion comprises low-order harmonics, and that the distortion doesnt change its harmonic character with frequency           ',\n",
       " 'I used my   system   to measure the Octave V 40 SE. After installing the four KT88 output tubes per the setup sheet, and before doing any measurements, I let the amplifier warm up for a morning. I then checked the bias voltage for the KT88s using the front-panel rotary switch and the LED display. All four LEDs illuminated green, which, according to the excellent owners manual, means \"Setting is OK.\" I took a complete set of measurements with the amplifier used alone, then repeated most of the testing with the auxiliary Black Box capacitor bank connected.The maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same with or without the Black Box outboard capacitance bank, at 38.75dB, and the V 40 SE preserved absolute polarity; ie, was non-inverting. The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was, at 61.5k ohms, usefully higher than the specified 50k ohms, and was still 51k ohms at the top of the audioband. The output impedance is specified as 2 ohms; however, the measured impedance was significantly higher than this, at 3.3 ohms at 20Hz, 4.3 ohms at 1kHz, and 3.8 ohms at 20kHz. I was surprised that these measured impedances were not lowered by the Black Box.With these high output-impedance values, the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker, resulting from the Ohms law interaction between the amplifiers output impedance and the manner in which the load impedance varies with frequency, reached ±2.1dB  . The two channels matched very closely in the audioband into 8 ohms  , though the left channel rolled off a little earlier above 20kHz. The ultrasonic rolloff is very fast, and there is a sign of a slight peak developing between 30 and 50kHz in the right channel into lower impedances  . This correlates with some critically damped overshoot—one half-cycle of overshoot and no ringing—with a 10kHz squarewave  .Fig.1 Octave V 40 SE, frequency response with volume control at its maximum at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Octave V 40 SE, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was modest, at >65dB below 1kHz, and just 38dB in both directions at 20kHz.   I measure an integrated amplifiers signal/noise ratio in the worst-possible case, with its input shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum. The wideband, unweighted ratio under these conditions, ref. 2.83V or 1W into 8 ohms and with the Black Box connected, was 77.6dB in the left channel and 78.5dB in the right. The ratios improved to 79.9 and 84.3dB, respectively, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 84.2 and 87dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the V 40 SEs output while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms   revealed that the left channels slightly poorer noise performance was due to a higher level of 60Hz in that channel, though at –83dB  , this wont be audible.Fig.3 Octave V 40 SE, spectrum of 1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms, DC–1kHz  .The V 40 SEs maximum output power is specified at 40Wpc into 4 ohms  . Figs. 4 and 5 plot the THD+noise percentage in the amplifiers output against output power into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. We define clipping as when the THD+N reaches 1%, and these two graphs indicate that, into both impedances, the Octave clips at 26.5W  . Adding the Black Box didnt increase the power at clipping. However, the V 40 SE reaches its specified power into 4 ohms at 1.12% THD+N, and the THD+N is still just 1.18% at 50Wpc into 4 ohms  , which is when the amplifier starts to hard clip  . Below 50W, the THD+N rises linearly with increasing power, this due to the low level of loop negative feedback used.Fig.4 Octave V 40 SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Octave V 40 SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The distortion below 1W is low, especially into higher impedances. Fig.6 plots the percentage of THD+N against frequency at 2.83V into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The distortion rises at the frequency extremes, as expected from the circuit topology, but only into 2 ohms   does it become problematically high. Fortunately, the distortion content at low powers is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic, even into low impedances  , though it is joined at higher powers by some high-order harmonics  . High-frequency intermodulation distortion   was what Id expected from the Octaves THD-vs-frequency behavior, with the 1kHz difference component—resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10Wpc into 8 ohms—reaching –50dB  . There is a peculiar rise in the power-supply–rated spuriae in the mid-treble in this graph, which was taken with the Black Box connected. Disconnecting the Black Box didnt change this behavior, nor did experimenting with all the various ways of grounding the amplifier to the Audio Precision test system.Fig.6 Octave V 40 SE, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Octave V 40 SE, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 4 ohms  , 0.208% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Octave V 40 SE, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Octave V 40 SE, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms  .Other than that anomaly, Octaves V 40 SE measured as I would expect from a traditional design that uses a pair of KT88 output tubes for each channel. And, like Octaves RE 290, a 100Wpc power amplifier favorably reviewed by Erick Lichte in our January 2013 issue, the V 40 SE is constructed to an impressively high standard.           ',\n",
       " '  Pathos InPoL Remix MkII with my  , checking some of the results with the magazines APx500 system.The review sample was not fitted with the optional HiDac Mk2 digital-input board. Although the Remix MkIIs output stages are described as operating in class-A, where the maximum heat dissipation is with no signal, I still preconditioned the Pathos amplifier before the testing by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the heatsinks were hot, at 118.1°F  , as was the top panel, at 113.6°F  . This amplifier needs to be well-ventilated.The Pathoss volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps, and the maximum voltage gain from the loudspeaker outputs into 8 ohms was 36.2dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs. The maximum gain at the balanced Pre outputs was 17dB; at the single-ended Pre outputs it was 10.1dB; and from the headphone output it was 8dB. The Remix MkII preserved absolute polarity   at all the outputs with both input types. The input impedance is specified as 47k ohms.I measured a usefully higher 92k ohms for the unbalanced input at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still-high 50.5k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was 176k ohms at 20Hz, 180k ohms at 1kHz, and 137k ohms at 20kHz. The Pathos wont load down source components,The Pathoss line-level source impedances were 929 ohms from the balanced Pre output, 465 ohms from the unbalanced Pre output, and a usefully low 1 ohm from the headphone output, these values consistent across the audioband. The loudspeaker output impedance was a relatively high 0.8 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.84 ohm at 20kHz.   The modlation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance  of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore ±0.7dB  , which may well be audible. The response into resistive loads was flat in the audioband but rolled off above 20kHz. The response into 8 ohms   was down by 1dB at 80kHz, that into 2 ohms   was –1dB at 55kHz.Fig.1 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Note the 0.25dB channel imbalance in favor of the right channel in this graph, which was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the imbalance was identical when I repeated the response measurement with the control set to –20dB. The frequency response at the headphone output was down by just 1dB at 200kHz. As expected from the Remix MkIIs wide small-signal bandwidth, its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave from the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms   was superb, with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.2 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was very good, at >95dB below 2kHz and still 73dB at the top of the audioband. Measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/ noise ratio was a disappointing 52.2dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  , improving to 71.9dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz– 22kHz. Switching an A-weighting filter into circuit further improved the ratio to 75.6dB. Spectral analysis of the Remix MkIIs low-frequency noisefloor with the volume control set to its maximum   revealed a relatively high level of random noise, with low-level spuriae visible at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its odd-order harmonics. Repeating the analysis with the volume control set to –20dB   reduced the levels of both the random noise and the 60Hz-related spuriae by the same 20dB. This suggests that the noise occurs in the circuit ahead of the volume control, perhaps in the input tubes.Fig.3 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at maximum   and at –20dB    .The Pathos InPoL Remix MkII is specified to deliver up to 25Wpc into 8 ohms   and 38Wpc into 4 ohms  , the former at 0.1% THD. With our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, and with both channels driven, the Remix MkII clipped with a 1kHz signal at 20W into 8 ohms   and at 8W into 4 ohms  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N gave powers of 30W into 8 ohms   and 12W into 4 ohms  . The amplifier met its specified maximum power into 4 ohms at 6.5% THD+N.Fig.4 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The shape of the traces in  s.4 and 5 suggests that the actual distortion starts to rise above the noisefloor at a few hundred milliwatts and increases steadily as the power rises. This implies that little or no loop negative feedback is present. I examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 5.3V, which is equivalent to 3.5W into 8 ohms and 7W into 4 ohms. The THD+N was close to 0.1% into 8 ohms  , but was 10 times higher into 4 ohms  . The THD+N percentage was a little higher in the right channel into both loads.Fig.6 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, THD+N   vs frequency at 5.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The left channels distortion with 1kHz into 8 ohms was predominantly the third harmonic  , but in the right channel   it was joined by the second harmonic at the same level, –73dB or 0.02%. At the same voltage, 2.83V, into 4 ohms  , the third harmonic rose to –54dB   in both channels. Intermodulation distortion with the amplifier driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1W into 8 ohms   was low in level. Both the second-order difference product at 1kHz and the higher-order intermodulation products lay at –80dB  . A peculiar rise in the high-frequency noisefloor can be seen in the right channels spectrum  .Fig.7 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.257% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .The Pathos InPoL Remix MkIIs measured performance appears to be dominated by its use of a tubed input stage with little or no loop negative feedback.   But the amplifiers inability to drive low impedances without what I feel to be excessive levels of harmonic distortion is a matter for concern.

       " 'When I unpacked the Riviera Levante amplifier and lifted it onto the test bench, it struck me that this is actually eight amplifiers in one. It has balanced and single-ended line-level inputs. Its output stage can be operated in class-A or class-AB. It was supplied with two choices for the two input stage ECC81/12AT7 tubes: vintage Mullards or modern JJs. Add to those variations that the Levante has a headphone output and an optional phono stage  , and it became clear that I had a lot of testing ahead of me.I decided to focus on the Riviera amplifiers behavior with the Mullard tubes and the unbalanced inputs, performing every test in both of the output-stage modes. I then repeated some of the tests with the balanced inputs and finally looked at how the amplifiers behavior with the JJ tubes differed from how it had performed with the Mullard tubes. All the testing was performed  .I first preconditioned the Riviera Levante by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified class-AB power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the heatsink temperature was 108.3°F   and that of the top and front panels was 92.5°F  . Switching to class-A operation, the heatsink temperature had increased slightly after another 30 minutes, to 113.1°F  . While I was preconditioning the amplifier,   output device rail voltages. They were ±29V in class-A, ±50V in class-AB.The amplifier inverted absolute polarity with all its inputs at both the loudspeaker and headphone outputs. The maximum gain into 8 ohms was lower than average for an integrated amplifier, at 36.6dB in class-A and 36.35dB in class-AB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs. The maximum gain at the headphone output was 21.6dB for both types of input. Changing to the JJ tubes reduced these gains by 1dB.The unbalanced input impedance was 44k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz with the Mullard tubes, dropping to 36k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 42k ohms across the audioband. With the JJ tubes the unbalanced input impedance was 34k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 30k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone output impedance was moderately low, at 18 ohms across the audioband. Set to class-A operation, the Levantes output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 0.5 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz. In class-AB, the output impedance was slightly higher, at 0.65 ohm at all audio frequencies.   In class-A mode, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between the source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker, was ±0.4dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB at 180kHz, which correlates with the Rivieras accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  . Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the unbalanced inputs, the Mullard tubes, class-A mode, and the volume control set to its maximum. The frequency and squarewave responses were identical with the JJ tubes, in class-AB, and with the balanced inputs. With the volume control set to –20dB, the high-frequency –3dB point dropped to 110kHz, but the audioband response remained flat. Measured at the headphone output, the response was down by just 1dB at 200kHz.Fig.1 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms   4 ohms  ,    .Fig.2 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was okay at 70dB in both directions below 3kHz, dropping to 53dB at the top of the audioband. The Rivieras unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, was 70.6dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms   in both class-A and class-AB modes. This ratio improved to 72dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 80dB when A-weighted. The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its even- and odd-order harmonics  , the latter higher in level than the former, particularly in the left channel  .  Fig.3 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, volume control set to maximum  .With both channels driven, the Levantes maximum power in class-A is specified as 30Wpc into 8 ohms and 60Wpc into 4 ohms  . We define clipping as when the THD+noise in an amplifiers output reaches 1%. By that standard, the Levante didnt meet its specified powers, the 1% THD+N power measuring 16Wpc into 8 ohms   and 21.3Wpc into 4 ohms  . However, relaxing the criterion to 3% THD+N, the Riviera amplifier clipped at 49Wpc into 8 ohms   and 79Wpc into 4 ohms  . The picture was similar in class-AB. The Levante delivered 12Wpc into 8 ohms   at 1% THD+N, 125Wpc at 3%  , and 18Wpc into 4 ohms   at 1% and 195Wpc into 4 ohms at 3%  . The AC mains voltage was 119.1V with the amplifier clipping in class-A into 4 ohms.Fig.4 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-AB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-AB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The upward slope of the traces below the actual clipping power in  s.4–7 indicates that the distortion increases in almost a linear manner with increasing power before the onset of actual waveform clipping. This will be due to what is called a \"bent\" transfer function.   I suspect that this bent function will be due to the input tube rather than the amplifiers output stage. I examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 4.89V, which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms, 6W into 4 ohms, and 12W into 2 ohms. With the Mullard tubes the distortion into 8 ohms   was 0.47% at low and middle frequencies, rising slightly in the treble. It also rose into 4 ohms   and into 2 ohms  . The distortion was slightly lower with the JJ tubes  , but the behavior was otherwise identical.Fig.8 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.89V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.9 Riviera Levante, JJ tubes, class-A, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.89V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .These levels of distortion would be very audible if they comprised the fifth and higher harmonics  . However,  .10 indicates that the relatively subjectively benign second harmonic was dominant in both class-A and class-AB output modes. This waveform graph was taken with the Mullard tubes. Though HR found the JJ tubes to sound different from the Mullards, the JJs produced an almost identical THD+N waveform  . This was confirmed by the spectra of the amplifiers output at moderate power into 8 ohms with the Mullard tubes   and JJ tubes  . The second harmonic is by far the highest in level, at –40dB   with the Mullards and –43dB   with the JJs. The second was also by far the highest-level harmonic present in the headphone output, at –47dB   at 1V into 300 ohms. Finally, when the Levante drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10W peak into 8 ohms in either class-A or class-AB with both Mullard and JJ tubes, the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at –44dB  , with the higher-order intermodulation products at 18kHz and 21kHz 10dB lower in level. At the same voltage into 4 ohms, the intermodulation products rose by 3dB.Fig.10 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.95% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Riviera Levante, JJ tubes, class-A, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.75% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 Riviera Levante, JJ tubes, class-A, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.14 Riviera Levante, JJ tubes, headphone output, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.15 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms  .With its output stage capable of being switched between class-A and class-AB operation, Rivieras Levante reminded me of the Marantz MA-5 amplifier that I reviewed for Hi-Fi News magazine in August 1983, which, like the Levante, could output 30W in class-A and 120W in class-AB. But unlike that Marantz, which featured conventional levels of negative feedback, the Levantes measured behavior is dominated by the designers decision not to use feedback, especially around the input tubes. His reasons for doing so are discussed in the review, but my experience has been that the resultant harmonic signature will lend this amplifier a distinctive sonic character. Footnote 1: I created tracks on Stereophiles Test CD 2 to allow listeners to hear at what percentage of second, third, and seventh harmonic they become aware of the distortion.          ',\n",
       " '  LSA VT-70  . Although potentiometers on the top panel allow the bias currents for the output tubes to be adjusted, I understand that these currents are set by the manufacturer before the amplifier leaves the factory. Nevertheless, before I started the testing, I checked the tube bias with the front-panel meters after a 30-minute warm-up; with no signal and the volume control set to its minimum, the bias was very close to an indicated \"100\" for each tube.The LSA VT-70 preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, from both of its output transformer taps, from the headphone output, and from the preamplifier output. The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the loudspeaker outputs into 8 ohms was 37.4dB from the 8 ohm tap, 36.17dB from the 4 ohm output tap. The maximum gain from the headphone output was 41.4dB and from the preamplifier output, it was –0.23dB, ie, slightly lower than the input level. The single-ended input impedance is specified as a high 100k ohms. I measured a still-high 42k ohms at 20Hz, 44k ohms at 1kHz, and 39k ohms at 20kHz.The preamplifier output impedance was a low 2 ohms at high and middle frequencies, though it rose to 265 ohms in the low bass, presumably due to the presence of a series coupling capacitor. The headphone outputs source impedance was a high 470 ohms across the audioband, which means this output will not be optimal for use with low-impedance headphones.Although the VT-70s loudspeaker output impedance is specified as 8 ohms or 4 ohms, I suspect that these actually refer to the nominal values of the output transformer taps. The source impedance of the 8 ohm tap was a very high 5.1 ohms at low and midrange frequencies, rising to 7.4 ohms at the top of the audioband. As expected, the impedance was lower from the 4 ohm tap, at 2.7 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 3.8 ohms at 20kHz. The variation in the LSA-70 amplifiers small-signal frequency response from the 8 ohm tap with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was an audible ±2.4dB. From the 4 ohm tap  , the variation was smaller, at ±1.75dB, but this will still be audible. Into resistive loads  , the VTA-70 started to gently roll off in the top octave, with then a sharp dropoff above 45kHz.Fig.1 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.1, taken with the volume control set to its maximum, features excellent channel matching. The channel gains were less well-matched at lower settings of the volume control, with the right channel almost 1dB higher in level than the left when the control was set to –10dB. This difference decreased to 0.3dB with the control set to –20dB.The VT-70s reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   was superbly square, which correlates with the extended low frequencies seen in  .1. However, the ultrasonic rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  , and the small peak just above 40kHz in the frequency response is associated with some ringing on the tops and bottoms of the waveform.Fig.2 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The VT-70s channel separation   was >60dB in both directions below 2kHz but decreased to 40dB R–L and 46dB L–R at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   was a good 76.7dB  . This ratio improved slightly, to 77.8dB, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 90.1dB when A-weighted. The S/N ratios at the 4 ohm taps were around 1.5dB greater. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the LSAs 8 ohm tap drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms   revealed a low level of random noise, and the AC-related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics lay at or below –80dB. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum. Peculiarly, with the control set to –20dB, the odd-order AC-related spuriae were all higher in level.Fig.4 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum   and to –20dB    .LSA specifies the VT-70s maximum power as 35Wpc into 8 ohms  , which is what I would expect from a push-pull pair of EL34 tubes operated in Ultralinear mode.   With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—and with both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of just 7Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms   and the same from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . Relaxing the clipping definition to 3% THD+N gave output powers of 25.3Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms   and 28.45Wpc from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifier uses a limited amount of loop negative feedback. With the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  , 1% THD+N was reached at 19.5Wpc   and 3% THD+N at 27Wpc  . More significantly, the THD+N was lower at low powers than it had been with the load matched to the nominal transformer tap.Fig.5 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.8 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency from the 4 ohm tap into 8 and 4 ohms at 4.9V, which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms and 6W into 4 ohms. The THD+N was higher in the right channel   than the left   and as, shown in  .7, was lower with the higher load impedance. The THD rose at low frequencies due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformer. The THD+N percentage at the same voltage from the 8 ohm tap   was about 5 times as high as it was from the 4 ohm tap.Fig.8 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion waveform from either tap   suggests that the second harmonic was dominant. However, at low frequencies, the third harmonic was the highest in level  , which again will be due to the output transformer. Note that the right channels second harmonic in this graph is almost 20dB higher than in the left channel. This might have been due to the output tubes bias currents not being sufficiently closely matched in that channel, except that these appeared identical when I checked the bias before testing. It is more likely, therefore, that one of the right channels output tubes had aged out of spec.   However, at the same output voltage at higher frequencies  , the second and third harmonics are equally high in level in both channels, each close to –60dB  .Fig.9 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 3W into 8 ohms, 0.18% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .Despite the relatively high level of harmonic distortion, intermodulation distortion was only moderate in level. With the VT-70s 8 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay at –66dB  . The higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were only 4dB higher in level.Fig.12 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .The LSA VT-70s measured performance is typical of a conventional tubed design using a push-pull pair of EL34s for its output stage and with only a small amount of loop negative feedback. The lowest distortion will be obtained from the 4 ohm output transformer tap, especially driving impedances >4 ohms, with no significant reduction in maximum power.           ',\n",
       " 'The Line Magnetic LM-845IA looks identical to the companys LM-518IA integrated amplifier that Herb Reichert reviewed in October 2015. However, there are many differences in the details. The amplifier still uses a single 845 directly heated triode for each channels output stage.   I followed the instructions in the manual for setting the bias current for these tubes at the recommended 70mA. After the amplifier had been operating for 30 minutes, I shorted the inputs to ground and adjusted the hum-balancer controls to minimize the noise in each channels output.    amplifier with my    . The output transformer taps are marked \"16,\" \"8,\" and \"4.\" I performed a complete series of tests from each of the three taps using one of the single-ended line-level inputs, then repeated some of the tests using the single-ended \"Pre-In\" input, which is connected directly to the LM-845s power amplifier stage.The LM-845IAs unbalanced input impedance was a high 70k ohms at 20Hz, dropping slightly to 67.5k ohms at 1kHz and to a still-high 44k ohms at 20kHz. The \"Pre-In\" input impedance was 55k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 43k ohms at 20kHz. The Line Magnetic amplifier preserved absolute polarity with both sets of inputs from all three transformer taps. The amplifiers maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms depended on the output tap. The highest gain was from the 16 ohm tap, at 40.3dB. The gain from the 8 ohm tap was 38.6dB, and from the 4 ohm tap it was 36.3dB. The gains using the \"Pre-In\" input were all 15dB lower.The amplifiers output impedance also depended on the output tap. From the 16 ohm tap, the impedance was a high 3.9 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping very slightly to 3.65 ohms at 20kHz. This results in very audible ±2dB variations in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker load  . The variations in response were reduced to ±1.1dB with the 8 ohm tap, which had an output impedance of 2.1 ohms at 20Hz and 1.95 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz. As expected, the lowest output impedance was from the 4 ohm tap: 1.2 ohms at 20Hz and 1.1 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz. While these impedances are relatively low for a single-ended–triode amplifier, the response modification from this tap with the simulated loudspeaker was a still-audible ±0.8dB  .Fig.1 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 16 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Into resistive loads, the small-signal response from all three transformer taps was flat to 20kHz and rolled off above that frequency  . The ultrasonic rolloff is disturbed by a residual resonance at 70kHz, this highest in level from the 4 ohm tap. This behavior is associated with a small amount of overshoot and ringing with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . At low frequencies, the amplifier started to roll off below 30Hz, but its reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave   had only slightly sloped-down tops and bottoms, a tribute to the Line Magnetics massive output transformers.Fig.2 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 4 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.3 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.4 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum. The channel matching was within 0.25dB but increased to 0.4dB in favor of the left channel at lower settings of the volume control. Channel separation at 1kHz was okay, at 61dB, L–R, and 64.7dB, R–L, but reduced to 45.2dB and 52.1dB, respectively, at the top of the audioband.Measured at the 16 ohm taps and taken with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control at its maximum, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 70.6dB   ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 72.2dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 81.9dB when A-weighted. The S/N ratios from the 8 ohm tap were 2dB greater and another 2dB greater from the 4 ohm tap, these improvements correlating with the lower gain from these taps.   The main power supply–related spuriae in the LM-845IAs noise floor were at 120Hz and 240Hz, the latter higher in the left channel than the right  . The highest in level, at 120Hz, lay at a respectably low –76dB, right channel, and –80dB, left channel, both ref. 1W in both channels. The 120Hz sidebands around the 1kHz tone were a little higher in level in the right channel.Fig.5 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at its maximum  .The Line Magnetic amplifier is specified as delivering 22Wpc, though no load impedance is mentioned.   Using our usual definition of clipping, which is when the outputs THD+noise percentage reaches 1%, with both channels driven with a 1kHz signal the LM-845IAs 16 ohm tap clipped at just 2Wpc into 16 ohms  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N resulted in a power of 18Wpc into 16 ohms  , and the amplifier output the specified 22W from this tap at 3.5% THD+N. Distortion at low powers was lower with the 16 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  , and the amplifier now reached 1% THD+N at 10Wpc  , though the power at 3% THD+N had dropped to 16Wpc  .Fig.6 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 16 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 16 ohms.Fig.7 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 16 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.The same trend was apparent with the 8 ohm tap, where the lowest distortion at low powers was obtained with this tap driving 4 ohms  . I usually expect tube amplifiers to give lower distortion when driving impedances greater than the nominal tap value. However, the LM-845IA had greater distortion at low powers in this situation. This can be seen in  .9, which plots the THD+N percentage against power with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms. The distortion is above 1% at all powers above 800mW!Fig.8 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.9 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.The shape of the traces in  s.6–9 suggests that the amplifier is \"soft\" clipping, with the usual sharp \"knee\" in the trace where the waveform visibly squares off occurring at THD+N levels above 10%.The distortion levels in  s.6–9 were taken with the left channel and never drop below 0.1%  . However, the distortion was a little lower in the right channel than the left. Fig.10 plots the THD+N percentage against frequency from the 8 ohm tap at 2.83V into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , which is equivalent to 1W and 2W, respectively. Except in the bass, the left channel   had higher distortion into both impedances than the right  . The distortion into all loads from all three transformer taps rose in the top audio octaves.Fig.10 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The LM-845IAs distortion in the midrange was predominantly the sonically benign second harmonic  , though the more troubling third harmonic was only slightly lower in level at low frequencies  . When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 1W into 4 ohms from the 8 ohm tap  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB   in the left channel   but was 14dB higher in the right channel  . The higher-order intermodulation products were all below 0.1%  . Repeating this spectral analysis from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms, the 1kHz product in the right channel rose to –50dB  .Fig.11 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 4 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.4% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.13 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .The Line Magnetic LM-845IAs performance on the test bench was much as I expect from a tube amplifier with a single-ended output stage. It must be used with high-sensitivity speakers, like AHs Altec Valencias, if distortion is not to become audible. Counterintuitively, the Line Magnetics 16 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps work best with speakers that have impedances lower than the nominal tap value. However, these two taps have sufficiently high output impedances that the amplifiers sonic character will be different with every loudspeaker with which it is used. The 4 ohm tap has a lower output impedance, but this is at the expense of higher distortion, even at low powers, than the higher-impedance taps.           ',\n",
       " '  Mastersound Compact 845 amplifier  . The tubes were installed when I received the review sample, and I waited for an hour after powering up the amplifier before starting the testing. The Mastersound runs hot—after an hour the temperature of the top panel in front of the line-stage tubes was 115.9°F/46.6°C.The Compact 845 inverted polarity from both the 4 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps with the balanced and single-ended inputs but preserved absolute polarity from its Direct inputs, which bypass the preamplifier stage and volume control. The voltage gain at 1kHz from the unbalanced Direct inputs was 23.1dB from the 8 ohm tap and 20.7dB from the 4 ohm tap, both  ures into 8 ohms. From the regular inputs, the gain into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm tap with the volume control set to its maximum was 32dB, balanced, and 36.55dB, unbalanced. The maximum gains from the 4 ohm tap were both 2.3dB lower.The input impedance is specified as a high 50k ohms. For the single-ended Direct input, I measured 33k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 28.6k ohms at 20kHz. The normal unbalanced inputs impedance varied from a high 71k ohms at 20Hz to 52.6k ohms at 20kHz; the balanced input impedance was much lower, at 3230 ohms across the audioband.Fig.1 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The source impedance from the 8 ohm output tap was a high 3.5 ohms at 20Hz, 2.6 ohms at 1kHz, and 7.3 ohms at 20kHz. The variation in the small-signal frequency response with this output with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was therefore moderately high, at ±1.7dB. The 4 ohm taps source impedance was lower, at 1.7 ohms at 20Hz, 1.3 ohms at 1kHz, and 3.15 ohms at 20kHz, which meant that the response variation with the simulated speaker was lower, at ±1dB. However, there will be audible modifictions of loudspeaker responses with both output taps. Into resistive loads  , the Mastersound amplifiers 8 ohm output shelved down below 40Hz and rolled off above 10kHz, reaching –3dB at 18kHz. A sharply defined response peak at 30kHz correlates with overshoot and ringing in the amplifiers reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  . This peak was higher in amplitude with higher load impedances and from the 4 ohm output transformer tap.Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the left channel is 0.26dB higher in level at 1kHz than the right. This difference increased to 0.46dB when I repeated the measurement with the volume control set to –20dB, though the response was otherwise identical.                Download audio            Something I noticed while doing these tests was that the Compact 845 emitted audible sounds  , which seemed to be coming from the output tube circuitry rather than the transformers. While the level wasnt very high—the spl in front of the amplifier was 66dB , slow ballistics, with the amplifier driving 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms—it was still readily audible and was not masked by the NPR news playing on a nearby portable radio in the test lab.The Compact 845s channel separation   was relatively poor, at 50dB in both directions below 1kHz, decreasing to 30dB at the top of the audioband. I monitored the waveform on an oscilloscope when I performed this measurement, which indicated that I was measuring true crosstalk rather than noise. The Mastersound amplifiers output had a relatively low level of noise. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio  , taken from the 8 ohm taps with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was 67.6dB  . This ratio improved slightly to 68.5dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 78.9dB when A-weighted. With their lower gain, the ratios from the 4 ohm outputs were 2dB greater.Fig.3 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum   and to –20dB    .Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Mastersounds 8 ohm taps drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum   revealed a low level of random noise. However, AC supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics were present, and their levels didnt change when I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer. The highest of these spuriae, at 120Hz, lay at –73dB  . Repeating the analysis with the volume control set to –20dB   lowered the levels of the power supply–related spuriae by up to 6dB, but the random noisefloors level didnt change.Fig.4 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Mastersound 845 Compact, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Mastersound specifies the Compact 845s maximum power as 30W, which is equivalent to 14.76dBW into 8 ohms and 11.76dBW into 4 ohms. According to Stereophiles usual definition of clipping, when THD+N reaches 1%, the amplifier didnt get close to that power. With both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of 11.5Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms   and 6.9Wpc from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . Raising the clipping limit to 3% THD+N, I measured 22Wpc with each output tap matched to the load. At 10% THD+N, the Compact 845 approaches its specified power.Fig.6 Mastersound 845 Compact, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Tube amplifiers usually have less distortion when the load impedance is greater than the nominal output transformer impedance. As revealed in  .6, which plots the THD+N percentage against output power with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms, the Mastersounds THD+N was higher with a larger load impedance, not lower. At 3% THD+N, the 4 ohm tap was putting out 10Wpc into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.7 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency, with the 8 ohm tap driving 8 and 4 ohms at 4.9V, which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms and 6W into 4 ohms. The huge rise in distortion above 10kHz may well be due to the high-frequency rolloff in this region and, perhaps, to the fact that the distortion is being magnified by the output transformer resonance seen in  .1. The THD+N rose slightly at low frequencies and was higher into 4 ohms   than it was into 8 ohms  . At the same voltage from the 4 ohm tap  , the distortion in the midrange and treble was close to 0.6% into 4 ohms and 1% into 8 ohms.Fig.8 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.29% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 3Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 3Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fortunately, as  .8 shows, the distortion was predominantly the   second harmonic, with higher-order harmonics progressively lower in level  . However, at low frequencies  , the level of the third harmonic was the same as the second, perhaps indicating the onset of core saturation in the output transformers.Fig.11 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 3Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Due to the masking, the level of the second harmonic may not result in audible distortion with music, as long as it is not accompanied by intermodulation distortion. With the Compact 845s 8 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 3Wpc peak into 8 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay at –30dB  , and many higher-order intermodulation products were present. This behavior correlates with the increase in THD+N in the top audio octave seen in  .7. The amplifier may well sound better than this test suggests, since top-octave energy level is typically lower in music than in test tones. However, this information is presented here, as it is with every review, since we standardized on this intermodulation test when we started measuring amplifiers three decades ago.Other than the differences caused by different output tubes—the 845 tube is capable of putting out more power than the 300B—these results are very similar to those measured in the Mastersound 300 B S.E. integrated amplifier, which Art Dudley reviewed in March 2008. The high levels of distortion and the high source impedances will be due to the single-ended triode topology and the decision not to use loop negative feedback. I concluded my discussion of the 300 B S.E. measurements by asking whether the reviewer liked the amplifier because of what it did right despite what it did wrong, or because of what it did wrong. In 2008, I didnt have an answer to that question. I still dont.           ',\n",
       " '  Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE    . The VK56-SE looks identical to the VK-55SE, which Wes Phillips reviewed in April 2010, and it was instructive to compare its measured performance with that of the earlier amplifier. Like the VK-55SE, the VK-56SE has four output terminals for each channel, various pairs of which can be used to provide a feed from three different output-transformer taps labeled High, Med, and Low. I performed a complete set of measurements from each tap, but have concentrated on the Low outputs in this discussion, as those were the taps preferred by Herb Reichert.Both the small-signal and output tubes are delivered numbered, and I installed them from left to right, as instructed in the manual. The amplifiers maximum voltage gain from the High output tap was the same as the VK-55SEs and lower than the norm, at 24dB into 8 ohms. The gain from the Med tap was 23.2dB, and 23dB from the Low tap. Each output tap was non-inverting  , with pin 2 of the XLR jacks wired hot. The input impedance was very high—a good thing—at 155k ohms across the audioband.  The output impedance from the VK-56SEs High tap was both very high, at 6.7 ohms from low to high frequencies, and higher than that of the earlier amplifier. As a result of the Ohms law interaction between the high output impedances and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, the amplifiers frequency response into this load varied by a very audible ±2.1dB from the High tap  . The output impedance was lower from the Med and Low taps, at 5.5 and 3.35 ohms, respectively. The response from the Low tap with our simulated loudspeaker varied by ±1.5dB  , compared with ±1.2dB for the VK-55SE. Into resistive loads, the VK-56SE offered a flat response in the audioband, with excellent channel matching and a wide small-signal bandwidth. The amplifiers ultrasonic response into 8 ohms didnt reach –3dB until 150kHz, which correlates with a very square squarewave response  . The waveforms risetimes are very short, and there is neither overshoot nor ringing.Fig.1 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.3 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was good, but not as good as that of the earlier amplifier, measuring >70dB in both directions below 3kHz, and decreasing to >58dB at the top of the audioband. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, measured at the High output tap and taken with the input shorted, was good at 79.2dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms in the right channel. It was worse in the left channel, however, measuring 67.5dB. When A-weighted, these ratios respectively improved to 96.2 and 83.3dB. The ratios from the Low tap were 1-2dB worse. The reason for the difference between the channels ratios can be seen in  .4, which shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output as it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms from the High tap. Power-supply–related spuriae at 60 and 180Hz, and especially 120Hz, are up to 17dB higher in the left channel   than the right  . I checked the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer, but couldnt get any lower noise than is shown in this graph.Fig.4 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms    .Like the VK-55SE, the VK-56SE is specified as having a maximum output power of 55Wpc into 8 ohms   at 3% THD+noise. The VK-56SE delivered 60Wpc into 8 ohms from its High tap  , 59Wpc from the Med tap  , and 54Wpc from the Low tap, all at 3% THD+N. However, the distortion at lower powers was higher than I like to see, as can be seen in  .5, which plots the THD+N percentage against output power into 8 ohms from the High tap. The steady rise in THD with power before actual waveform clipping is reached suggests that this amplifier uses only a modest amount of loop negative feedback. The 4 ohms delivery from the High output was similar  , though the power at 1% THD+N dropped from 5.3Wpc into 8 ohms to 3.1Wpc into 4 ohms. The Med tap delivered slightly more power at 1% THD+N into 4 ohms  , and 54Wpc at 3% THD+N  . Fig.8 plots the THD+N percentage against output power from HRs preferred Low tap into 8 ohms, and shows that the low-level distortion is lower than from the other two taps, even into 4 ohms  . However, into 2 ohms from the Low tap  , the distortion at low powers was the same as from the High tap into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Med output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.9 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.10 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The VK-55SEs two channels had differed in their small-signal linearity, which Id conjectured was due to our review samples tubes having had a lot of mileage on them. However, the VK-56SE behaved similarly. Fig.11 plots the THD+N percentage against frequency from the Low tap at 2.83V into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. Into the two higher impedances, the right channel   offered lower distortion in the midrange and treble than the left  , and into 2 ohms the left channels THD+N remained above 1%  . However, both channels offered higher levels of distortion as the frequency dropped, this presumably due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformers, and this behavior was more extreme from the High tap  .Fig.11 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.12 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Such high levels of distortion wont necessarily result in poor sound quality if the harmonics present are low-order. This would appear to be case from the waveform of the distortion content  , taken at 1W into 8 ohms from the High output, which appears to be predominantly second-harmonic in nature. This is confirmed by the spectrum of the VK-56SEs output at the same power from the Low tap  , though the third harmonic is only 7dB lower than the second. Although high-order harmonics are also present, these all lie at or below –80dB  .Fig.13 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  , 0.69% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.14 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Finally, as implied by the fact that the distortion percentage doesnt rise at the top of the audioband in  .11, the VK-56SE did okay on the demanding twin-tone test of high-frequency intermodulation  . At 1Wpc into 8 ohms from the Low tap, the 1kHz difference tone was the highest in level, at –54dB   in the left channel   and –57dB   in the right  . As had been the case with the VK-55SE, the higher-frequency tones in this spectrum are surrounded by sideband pairs at ±120Hz and its harmonics, suggesting that the amplifiers power supply is being stressed under these conditions.Fig.15 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms  .Overall, though the VK-56SE measured similarly to its predecessor, some aspects of its measured performance—the high output impedance, the differences in noise and linearity between channels—bothered me. But Im not surprised that HR preferred using the amplifiers Low output transformer taps; these give the best measured performance, especially into lower impedances, while preserving the \"tube amplifier\" character.

       " '  Western Electric 91E  . I carefully installed the tubes following the instructions in the excellent manual, and after turning on the amplifier, waited for the 91E to optimize the bias for the 300B output tubes. Once that was done, I waited another 30 minutes before starting the testing.The Western Electric 91E preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, from its loudspeaker, preamplifier, and headphone outputs. The volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps. A level of 1Wpc into 8 ohms was indicated as approximately –12dB on the front-panel meters. The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was a fairly low 29.6dB measured at the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms, 19.7dB from the headphone output, and –0.01dB from the preamplifier output, ie, an input of 1V resulted in an output of 998.5mV. The single-ended input impedance is specified as 20k ohms. I measured an inconsequentially lower value of 16.5k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 15.5k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone outputs source impedance was a relatively high 113 ohms across the audioband, which wont be optimal for low-impedance headphones. The loudspeaker output impedance was a high 3.3 ohms at 20Hz, falling slightly to 2.57 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz. The variation in the Western Electric amplifiers small-signal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was ±1.4dB, which would be audible. Into resistive loads  , the VTA-70 started to roll off above 10kHz, reaching –3dB at 35kHz. Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control. The 91Es reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   was superbly square. The ultrasonic rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  , though no overshoot or ringing is present.Fig.1 Western Electric 91E, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Western Electric 91E, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Western Electric 91E, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The 91Es channel separation   was >60dB in both directions below 2kHz but decreased to 40dB at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio  , taken with the input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was a good 79.7dB  . This ratio improved to 86.1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 90.6dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Western Electric amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to maximum   revealed a low level of random noise, and the AC-related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics lay at or below –90dB.Fig.4 Western Electric 91E, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum    .Western Electric specifies the 91Es maximum power into 8 ohms as 20Wpc   at 10% THD, 16Wpc   at 5% THD, and 14Wpc   at 3% THD  . With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—and with both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of just 1.8Wpc into 8 ohms  . At 3% THD+N, I measured 9.23Wpc  , and at 10%, 12.8Wpc  . Slightly more power was available into 4 ohms  : 4.8Wpc   at 1% THD+N; 10Wpc   at 3% THD+N; and 14Wpc   at 10% THD+N. The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifier uses a very limited amount of loop negative feedback.Fig.5 Western Electric 91E, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Western Electric 91E, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency into 8 and 4 ohms at 1V. The THD+N rose slightly at the frequency extremes and was higher in the left channel into 8 ohms   but in the right channel into 4 ohms  . At 2.83V, which is equivalent to 1W into 8 ohms  , the distortion was close to 1% in both channels.Fig.7 Western Electric 91E, THD+N   vs frequency at 1V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Western Electric 91E, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fortunately, the distortion waveform   was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  , at 0.8%. The third harmonic was also present, albeit at a lower level, especially into 4 ohms  . By themselves, the second and third harmonics may not result in audible distortion, even at relatively high levels. However, this will only be true if they are not accompanied by intermodulation distortion. With the 91E driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 4 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay at –50dB  , with the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz 10dB lower in level. These products were all 5dB higher in level at 1W into 8 ohms  , which experience leads me to believe is marginal performance. It is fair to note, however, that this level of intermodulation is identical to that of the Air Tight ATM-300R power amplifier that Art Dudley favorably reviewed in February 2019  , which also used a single 300B tube for each channels output.Fig.9 Western Electric 91E, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.8% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Western Electric 91E, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Western Electric 91E, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .  behavior of the Western Electrics phono input, I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the rear panel, to obtain the lowest noise. The phono input inverted absolute polarity at all the outputs. I measured a maximum gain at 1kHz at the loudspeaker outputs of 71.5dB   and 82.1dB  . I performed all the subsequent testing using the headphone output and with the volume control set to –9.5dB, to avoid overloading the tubed output stage.   I repeated some of the testing at the preamplifier output.The input impedance was 42k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 34.3k ohms at 20kHz   and 993 ohms at 20Hz, 979 ohms at 1kHz, 968 ohms at 20kHz  . The phono inputs RIAA error was very low, with very good channel matching  , though the low and high frequencies rolled off a little, reaching –1dB at 35Hz and 20kHz. Set to MM, the wideband, unweighted S/N ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a good 67dB  , ref. 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 79.7dB, while an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 84.2dB. The S/N ratios in MC mode were 10–12dB lower, but this is still a relatively quiet phono stage.Fig.12 Western Electric 91E, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .The phono input, measured at the headphone output, had high levels of distortion, with the second harmonic the highest in level at –44dB   with an input signal of 5mV. The harmonic distortion signature is very similar to that measured at the loudspeaker outputs, which makes me suspect that the headphone output is derived from the single-ended tubed output stage, most likely with a series resistor. I therefore repeated the spectral analysis at the preamplifier output  . Though high-order harmonics are visible, these all lie at or below –90dB  , and the second harmonic is now almost 50dB lower than it had been from the headphone output.Fig.13 Western Electric 91E, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 5mV input, measured at headphone output  .Fig.14 Western Electric 91E, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 5mV input, measured at Preamplifier output  .The high level of second harmonic distortion present in the headphone output affected the overload margin measurements. In MM mode, the margins, calculated from the difference between the nominal 1kHz input level of 5mV and the input voltage where the THD+N reached 1%, were disappointing, at 3.4dB at 20Hz, 4.2dB at 1kHz, and –8.4dB at 20kHz. The margins in MC mode, ref. 1kHz at 0.5mV, were all 0.5dB lower. However, repeating the overload margin measurements at the preamplifier output gave an 8dB improvement at 20Hz and 1kHz in both MM and MC mode, though the margins at 20kHz were still low.The Western Electric 91E is an intriguing mix of modern technology—the computer-optimized tube biasing, the precision volume control, the front-panel meters—and almost-century-old tube technology. Its measured performance is what I would expect from an amplifier with a single-ended output stage that uses a single 300B tube. Given its high levels of both harmonic and intermodulation distortion, even at lowish powers, it will work best with loudspeakers that have a 4 ohm nominal impedance and high sensitivity. Footnote 1: Kudos to Western Electric for reporting the THD level at which maximum output power is measured.—Jim AustinFootnote 2: I created tracks on Stereophiles Test CD 2 so listeners could hear at what percentage of second, third, or seventh harmonic they become aware of the distortion.

       " '  Audio Note Meishu Phono Tonmeister  . The tubes were already installed when I received the review sample. I removed the cover to check for proper installation. All was well. I waited for 30 minutes after powering up the amplifier before starting the testing.Looking first at its line inputs, the Meishu Tonmeister preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, from both the 4 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps. The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was a moderately low 29.65dB from the 4 ohm tap into 8 ohms and 31.3dB from the 8 ohm tap into the same load. The input impedance is specified as 100k ohms. I measured a still-high 77k ohms at 20Hz, 74.5k ohms at 1kHz, and 63.7k ohms at 20kHz.The source impedance from the 8 ohm output tap was a high 3.2 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 3.45 ohms at 20kHz. The variation in the small-signal frequency response with this output with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was therefore high, at ±1.8dB. The variation was lower from the 4 ohm tap, at ±1.1dB  , but with both output taps, there will be audible modifications of loudspeaker responses with almost all loudspeakers. Into resistive loads  , the Audio Note amplifiers output started to roll off below 40Hz and above 20kHz, reaching –3dB at 9Hz and 55kHz. Figs.1 & 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control. There is the slightest hint of a resonant peak at 60kHz in the Meishu Tonmeisters frequency response, which correlated with some damped ultrasonic ringing in the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  .Fig.1 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, line input, 8 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, line input, 4 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.3 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Meishu Tonmeisters channel separation   was moderate, at 49dB, R–L, and 36dB, L–R, at 1kHz, respectively decreasing to 23dB and 40dB at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   taken from the 8 ohm taps with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was 69.7dB  . This ratio improved slightly to 71.5dB, left, and 69.6dB, right, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 86.7dB when A-weighted. With their lower gain, the ratios from the 4 ohm outputs were 1.3dB greater.Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Audio Notes 8 ohm taps drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum   revealed a low level of random noise. However, AC supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics were present. The highest of these, at 120Hz, lay at –76dB  . Its level didnt change when I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer.Fig.4 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum    .Audio Note specifies the Meishu Tonmeisters maximum power as 8W into both 4 and 8 ohms  , though no distortion percentage is mentioned. With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—and with both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of just 1Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms   and from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . At 3% THD+N, I measured 4.8Wpc with each output tap matched to the load, and at 10%, 12.2Wpc from the 8 ohm tap   and from the 4 ohm tap  , again with the taps matched to the loads. Less power was available from the 8 ohm tap into 4 ohms, but with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  , 5.75Wpc was available at 3% THD+N and 10Wpc at 10%  . The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifiers circuit doesnt use loop negative feedback. It is also fair to note that the waveform wasnt actually clipped at these high levels of distortion; instead, it was asymmetrically rounded off.Fig.5 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Figs.5–7 indicate that the lowest distortion at low power is obtained from the 4 ohm transformer tap. Fig.8 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency with this tap driving 8 and 4 ohms at 1V. The THD+N rose slightly at low frequencies and was significantly higher into 4 ohms   than it was into 8 ohms  . At the same level from the 8 ohm tap  , the distortion across the audioband was close to 0.5% into 8 ohms and 1% into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 4 ohm output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 1V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 1V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion waveform   was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic, with higher-order harmonics progressively lower in level  . However, the levels of the third, fifth, and seventh harmonics were higher at low frequencies  , which will probably be due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformers.Fig.10 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 0.5W into 8 ohms, 0.72% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1V into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 4 ohm output tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1V into 8 ohms  .Due to masking, in itself the level of the second harmonic may not result in audible distortion, but this will only be true if it is not accompanied by intermodulation distortion. With the Meishu Tonmeisters 4 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay just below –50dB  , with the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz 10dB lower in level. This is marginal performance, in my opinion.Fig.13 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 4ohms  .  behavior of the Audio Notes phono input, I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the amplifiers chassis ground post on its rear panel to obtain the lowest noise. The phono input preserved absolute polarity and the maximum gain at 1kHz was 67.8dB at the 8 ohm outputs and 66.14dB at the 4 ohm outputs. The gain was fixed at 36.4dB at the single-ended Source output, so, to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stage,   phono inputs behavior at the Source output with the volume control set to its minimum.The input impedance is specified as 47k ohms. I measured 48k ohms at 20Hz, 37.5k ohms at 1kHz, but just 8k ohms at 20kHz. The phono inputs RIAA equalization was very accurate, with excellent channel matching  , though the low frequencies rolled off a little, reaching –3dB at 16Hz. The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio with the inputs shorted to ground was a good 64dB in both channels, ref. 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 68.9dB, while an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 76dB. Negligible power supply–related spuriae were present in the phono stages noisefloor  ; this is a relatively quiet phono stage.Fig.14 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, phono input, response with RIAA correction, measured at Source output    .Fig.15 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, for 5mV input, measured at Source output  .The low-frequency and midrange overload margins, calculated from the difference between the nominal 1kHz input level of 5mV and the input voltage where the THD+N reached 1%, were superbly high, at 37.8dB at 20Hz and 32dB at 1kHz. The margin at 20kHz was lower at 14dB. The phono inputs harmonic distortion was respectably low in level, with the second harmonic the highest in level at –60dB  . With the relatively low overload margin at the top of the audioband, I wasnt surprised to find that the second-order difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones peaking at 25mV lay at –40dB  . High-order intermodulation products were vanishingly low in level, however, until I increased the signal level by 10dB.Fig.16 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 5mV input, measured at Source output  .Fig.17 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, MM phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz for 25mV input  .The Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phonos measured performance is what I would expect from an amplifier with a single-ended output stage that uses a single 300B tube for each channel. In this respect, its behavior resembles that of the Western Electric Type No.91E integrated amplifier that Ken Micallef reviewed in November 2022.           ',\n",
       " '  Musical Fidelity M8xi    . I first preconditioned the amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the top panel was very warm, at 109.6°F   and the heatsinks were too hot to touch, at 162.1°F  . I then started performing my usual thermal stress test by running the amplifier at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. However, I cut the test short after 20 minutes, as the top panels temperature was already 118.1°F   and that of the heatsinks 172.7°F   and I was concerned that I would damage the amplifier. Despite the massive heatsinks along its sides, the Musical Fidelity amplifier doesnt have quite enough thermal capacity for its power rating.I looked first at the Musical Fidelitys performance via its line inputs. While the balanced inputs offered a maximum gain at the speaker outputs of 36.6dB into 8 ohms, the unbalanced inputs offered a significantly higher 43.8dB. Usually, a single-ended input offers 6dB lower gain than a balanced input. The maximum gain at the variable preamplifier outputs was 12.76dB, balanced in to balanced out, and 13.6dB, unbalanced in to unbalanced out. At the fixed-level, unbalanced line output, the gain was 0.4dB for the single-ended inputs and 7.24dB for the balanced inputs. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity at all sets of outputs for both unbalanced and balanced input signals. The volume control operates in accurate 0.5dB steps.The single-ended line input impedance met the specification, at 25k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, though it dropped slightly to 21k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was lower than specified, at 17.8k ohms across the audioband. The preamplifier output impedance was an appropriately low 48 ohms, single-ended, and 96 ohms, balanced, though the latter rose to 189 ohms in the low bass.The Musical Fidelitys output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was a little higher than usual for a solid-state design, presumably due to the bridged output stage. It measured 0.27 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.33 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker, was ±0.2dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB just above 100kHz, which correlates with the Musical Fidelitys accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  . Note that the very low bass in  .1 rolls off a little, reaching –0.5dB at 20Hz and –1.5dB at 10Hz. Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; neither the frequency response nor the excellent channel matching changed at lower settings of the volume control.Fig.1 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms   4 ohms  ,    .Fig.2 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was good, at >80dB in both directions below 4kHz and still 67dB at the top of the audioband. The Musical Fidelitys unweighted signal/noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control at its maximum setting of \"100.0,\" was a little disappointing at 55.9dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms  . This ratio improved to 64.3dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband and to 67dB when A-weighted. The level of the background noise, which included spuriae at 60Hz and its even- and odd-order harmonics, depended on the setting of the volume control. This can be seen in  .3, which shows the low-frequency spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove 1kHz at 2.83V into 8 ohms with the volume control set to \"100.0\"   and to \"80.0\"  . Reducing the volume control setting by 20dB lowers the levels of the noise-floor components by around 13dB.Fig.3 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, volume control set to maximum   and to –20dB  .With both channels driven, the M8xi didnt quite meet its specified maximum power into 8 ohms of 550Wpc  , clipping   at 500Wpc  . However, I dont hold the wall AC voltage constant for the tests; it measured 120V with the amplifier idle but dropped to 116.2V when the amplifier was clipping into 8 ohms. The Musical Fidelity clipped at 650Wpc into 4 ohms  .   Even with the volume control set to \"90,\" the THD+N reading was dominated by noise below a few tens of watts, so I plotted how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The distortion was very low into 8 ohms  . However, it was higher into 4 ohms   and even more so into 2 ohms  , though still below 0.1% across the audioband.Fig.4 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The distortion was predominantly the subjectively benign third harmonic  . The volume control was set to its maximum for this measurement, and even with 32 captures averaged, the distortion waveform   was still overlaid with noise. Higher-order harmonics are present at lower levels, and the left channel had some second harmonic present  . When the M8xi drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 30W into 8 ohms  , high-order intermodulation products all lay below –76dB  , and the second-order difference product at 1kHz cant be seen above the noise floor, even though I had the volume control set to \"80.0\" for this measurement to reduce the level of the noise.Fig.7 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0157% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Musical Fidelity M8xi, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .The Musical Fidelity M8xi has optical and coaxial S/PDIF digital inputs, as well as a USB port. The coaxial inputs locked to data sampled up to 192kHz, the optical inputs to sample rates up to 96kHz. Apples USB Prober utility identified the Musical Fidelity as \"MF M8xi\" from \"Project.\" The USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode, and Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that the M8xi accepted 16- and 24-bit integer data sampled at all rates from 44.1kHz to 192kHz. The USB and S/PDIF inputs all preserved absolute polarity.With the volume control set to \"100.0,\" a 1kHz digital signal at –20dBFS resulted in an output level of 31.05V, which is equivalent to 120.5W into 8 ohms. As my measured clipping power into 8 ohms was 500W, which is equivalent to a voltage of 63.25V, it appears that the M8xis digital inputs have around 14dB too much gain. The –20dBFS digital signal results in levels of 1.908V at the balanced preamplifier output, 953.6mV at the unbalanced preamplifier output, and 191.1mV at the fixed-level single-ended line output. To avoid damaging the Musical Fidelitys power amplifier stage with high-level digital signals, I performed all the measurements of the digital inputs performance at the fixed-level outputs with the volume control set to \"0.0.\"The Musical Fidelitys impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the M8xis response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression just above half the sample rate  . An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   cant therefore be seen, though the distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor. The third harmonic is the highest in level at just above –60dB  . Peculiarly, the 19.1kHz tone and its third and fifth harmonics are accompanied by low-level, ±2kHz sidebands. The M8xis digital-input frequency response was flat in the audioband with then a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate  .Fig.10 Musical Fidelity M8xi, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.11 Musical Fidelity M8xi, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.12 Musical Fidelity M8xi, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Channel separation via the digital inputs was >100dB below 1kHz, but crosstalk rose linearly to –75dB at the top of the audioband, due to capacitive coupling between the channels. When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor components dropped by around 15dB, which implies that the M8xi offers between 18 and 19 bits worth of resolution. However, a large number of low-level, power-supply–related spuriae were present in the noise floor. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  .Fig.13 Musical Fidelity M8xi, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.14 Musical Fidelity M8xi, digital input, waveform of undithered 16-bit, 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS  .Fig.15 Musical Fidelity M8xi, digital input, waveform of undithered 24-bit, 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS  .  M8xi for its rejection of word-clock jitter via both its TosLink and USB inputs. Though all the odd-order harmonics of the 16-bit J-Test signals LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were at the correct levels  , the spectral spike that represents the high-level tone at exactly one-quarter the sample rate was significantly broadened at its base. This suggests that the Musical Fidelitys digital inputs are affected by random, low-frequency jitter. With 24-bit J-Test data  , no jitter-related sidebands were present, but the spectral broadening could still be seen.Fig.16 Musical Fidelity M8xi, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit Toslink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.17 Musical Fidelity M8xi, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit Toslink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Musical Fidelitys M8xi offers high power and low distortion. Though its noise floor with the volume control set to its maximum was higher in level than I was expecting, the amplifiers high gain, especially with digital data and single-ended analog input signals, means that the volume control will never be used anywhere near its maximum.           ',\n",
       " '  Krell K-300i    . I usually precondition amplifiers by running them at one- third power into 8 ohms for an hour. The Krell almost made it, turning itself off after 55 minutes, with the front-panel display showing the message \"Over temperature left channel.\" The top panel over the heatsinks was hot, at 142.8°F  , but cooler over the transformer at 113.1°F  . This is a tough test for an amplifier with a class-AB output stage, as one-third power results in the maximum dissipation in the output devices. The Krell has just sufficient heatsinking for its power rating but should be given plenty of space for ventilation.After the K-300i had cooled down, I was able to continue with the testing. Looking first at the line-level analog inputs, the Krells voltage gain into 8 ohms is specified as \"25dB, referenced to 2V RMS in balanced and full power output.\"   However, with the volume control set to its maximum of \"100,\" I measured a gain of 43.5dB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs into 8 ohms. While higher than the specification, this gain is typical for an integrated amplifier. The gain measured at the unbalanced preamplifier outputs was 21.25dB, which is on the high side.The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   for both XLR and RCA inputs at both the loudspeaker and preamplifier outputs. The single-ended input impedance is specified as 8k ohms, the balanced impedance as 16k ohms. However, my measurements indicated 12.7k ohms for the unbalanced input impedance but a low 4.4k ohms, ie, 2200 ohms per phase, for the balanced impedance.The output impedance is specified as a very low 0.035 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. By contrast, I measured 0.131 ohms at 20Hz, 0.133 ohms at 1kHz, and 0.159 ohms at 20kHz, these  ures including the series impedance of 6 of loudspeaker cable. Even so, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by less than ±0.1dB  .Fig.1 Krell K-300i, frequency response at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , and simulated loudspeaker    .The audioband response into impedances of 8 and 4 ohms   is flat up to 20kHz, and the two channels match very closely. The output into 2 ohms   was down by just 0.125dB at 20kHz. This graph was taken with the volume control set to \"100.\" Commendably, the ultrasonic rolloff didnt vary at lower volume-control settings, or from the preamplifier outputs. The K-300i amplifier has a wide small-signal bandwidth, and its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing.Fig.2 Krell K-300i, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at 90dB in both directions at 1kHz, though it reduced to 67dB, R–L, and 75dB, L–R, at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the volume control at \"100\" and the unbalanced input shorted to ground, was 63dB  , which improved to 76.5dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 78.8dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the Krells noise floor   revealed that the random noise level varied with the setting of the volume control, suggesting that this was related to the higher-than-usual preamplifier gain. The spuriae related to the power-line frequency were all very low in level, however.Fig.3 Krell K-300i, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to \"80\"   and \"100\"    .The Krells maximum power is specified as 150W into 8 ohms and 300W into 4 ohms, both equivalent to 21.8dBW. With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%, I found that the K-300i exceeded its specified power, clipping at 190W into 8 ohms   and 320W into 4 ohms  . Fig.7 shows how the Krells THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a moderate output level, 8.975V, into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. Commendably, the distortion in the top audio octave is only slightly higher than it is at low frequencies. The distortion is predominantly third harmonic in character  , though the second harmonic is only slightly lower in level  . High-order intermodulation products with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 40W into 4 ohms were relatively low in level  , and the second-order difference product lay at –86dB  .Fig.4 Krell K-300i, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Krell K-300i, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Krell K-300i, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.975V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Krell K-300i, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.0077% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Krell K-300i, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 40W into 4 ohms    .Fig.9 Krell K-300i, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms    .Turning to the digital inputs, Apples USB Prober utility identified the Krell amplifier as \"Krell K-300i\" from \"KRELL\" and indicated that the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that, via USB, the K-300i accepted 32-bit integer data sampled at all rates from 44.1 to 384kHz. All the digital inputs preserved absolute polarity  .With the Krells volume control set to its maximum and the level trim set to \"0dB,\" a 1kHz digital signal at –30dBFS resulted in a level of 779.1mV at the preamplifier outputs but 20.23V into 8 ohms from the speaker outputs. The latter is equivalent to 51W, which is just 4.7dB below the specified maximum power. As often appears to be the case with integrated amplifiers, the K-300is digital inputs have too much gain. I wanted to continue the testing from the preamplifier outputs using the menu to set the output mode set to \"Fixed.\" Peculiarly, however, the volume control was still active in this mode. To avoid blowing up the Krells output stage with high-level digital test signals, therefore, I continued the testing with the volume control set to \"53,\" which gave a level of 20V at the loudspeaker terminals.The K-300is impulse response with 44.1kHz data was a fairly long minimum-phase type, with all the ringing following the single high sample  . With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the Krells response reached full stop- band attenuation at 24kHz, suppressing the aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   by almost 110dB. The harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone can be seen in this graph, with the third the highest in level, at –74dB  . The K-300is frequency responses with data at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz followed the same basic shape but with a sharp rolloff above half of each sample rate  .Fig.10 Krell K-300i, digital inputs, impulse response  .Fig.11 Krell K-300i, digital inputs, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS   into 100k ohms with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.12 Krell K-300i, digital inputs, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the random noise floor dropped by 18dB, meaning that the Krells digital inputs offer 19 bits worth of resolution. However, a lot of low-level AC supply–related spuriae can be seen in this graph. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS, the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical  . With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a superbly clean sinewave  .Fig.13 Krell K-300i, digital inputs, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.14 Krell K-300i, digital inputs, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.15 Krell K-300i, digital inputs, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Intermodulation distortion via the digital inputs was even lower than it was via the analog inputs  , with the second-order difference product produced by equal-level tones at 19 and 20kHz with the combined waveform peaking at 0dBFS, lying at –93dB  . Finally, tested for its rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit USB data, all the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency square- wave were at the correct levels  . However, a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz to the sides of the peak that represents the high-level tone at one-quarter the sample rate can be seen, these power supply-related. Repeating the jitter test with TosLink data gave the same result, as did using 24-bit J-Test data  Fig.16 Krell K-300i, digital inputs, 24-bit data, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.17 Krell K-300i, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit USB data sourced from MacBook Pro  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.18 Krell K-300i, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit USB data sourced from MacBook Pro  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Overall, the Krell K-300i offers excellent measured performance. The only shortfall was the digital inputs very high gain, which probably led to the introduction of low-level supply-related spuriae.           ',\n",
       " '  two-channel version of the Emotiva XPA Gen3    .  s, I ran it at 100Wpc into 8 ohms for an hour.   At the end of that time, the louvers on the top panel above the two circuit boards were hot, at 134.4°F  , though the rest of the exterior case was cooler. This may be an inexpensive amplifier, but it has adequate heatsinking for its power rating, though this might be due to the fact that the case can hold up to seven amplification modules rather than the two of our review sample.The gain at the loudspeaker terminals for both balanced and unbalanced inputs was 29.4dB, and while the output preserved absolute polarity   for the unbalanced input, the balanced input inverted polarity, suggesting that the XLR jacks are wired with pin 2 cold, the opposite of the modern convention. The balanced input impedance was moderately high, at 27.5k ohms; the unbalanced input impedance was 14.5k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to 9.5k ohms at the top of the audioband.The output impedance, including the series resistance of the speaker cables I used, was very low at 20Hz and 1kHz, at 0.09 ohm, and rose only slightly at 20kHz, to 0.125 ohm. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by just ±0.1dB  . Fig.1 shows that the response into 8 ohms   starts to roll off at the top of the audioband, with the output reaching –0.3dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 70kHz. The response rolled off only slightly earlier into lower impedances, reaching –0.5dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . The Emotivas reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was very good  , with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Emotiva XPA Gen3, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Emotiva XPA Gen3, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was good rather than great, at 75dB or so from 20Hz to 5kHz, decreasing slightly to 67dB at the top of the audioband. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground, was good at 70.5dB left and 69.3dB right, both ratios ref. 1W into 8 ohms. Limiting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these respective ratios to a superb 95 and 93.9dB, while an A-weighting filter offered further improvement, to 99 and 98dB. The spectrum of the XPA Gen3s low-frequency noise floor while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms is shown in  .3. Other than some very low-level spuriae at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics in the left channel, the XPAs noise floor is very clean.Fig.3 Emotiva XPA Gen3, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Specified as delivering 300Wpc into 8 ohms   or 550Wpc into 4 ohms  , the XPA Gen3 clipped at 315Wpc into 8 ohms    , and at 520Wpc into 4 ohms    , both readings taken with both channels driven. Looking at how the percentage of THD+noise varied with frequency at a moderately high level  , the THD+N remained low at low and middle frequencies, and was even slightly lower in the low treble  . However, as can be seen in this graph, the percentage starts to rise in the mid-treble before climbing precipitously above 15kHz, exceeding 1% at 20kHz. All I can think of to explain this behavior is that the circuit has limited open-loop bandwidth, meaning that there is insufficient corrective negative feedback available at the top of the audioband.Fig.4 Emotiva XPA Gen3, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Emotiva XPA Gen3, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Emotiva XPA Gen3, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .At lower frequencies and moderate powers, the distortion signature is predominantly the third harmonic  . Though they cant be seen in the graph, there are small spikes surrounding each positive and negative waveform peak; ie, four per cycle, that could be seen on an analog scope. I have no idea where these spikes come from, unless they are related to the class-H voltage rail switching. At high powers, the third harmonic is joined by higher-order odd harmonics, as well as by the second and fourth harmonics  , though these are all very low in level.Fig.7 Emotiva XPA Gen3, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0082% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Emotiva XPA Gen3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .I usually test an amplifier for intermodulation distortion by driving it at a high power with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, which is very much the worst case. Given the dramatic rise in THD at the top of the audioband in  .6, I was not surprised to find that the Emotiva XPA Gen3 did very poorly on this test. Fig.9 reveals a picket fence of intermodulation products, with the second-order difference product at 1kHz lying at –33dB   ref. the waveforms peak level. Reducing the level to 1W   eliminated the difference product, but many higher-order intermodulation products are still present, the highest in level lying at –66dB  . I repeated the 100W test with an equal mix of tones and octave lower  ; though high-order intermodulation products can still be seen, these all now lie at or below –80dB  .Fig.9 Emotiva XPA Gen3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Emotiva XPA Gen3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Emotiva XPA Gen3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 9+10kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .Emotivas XPA Gen3 amplifier offers high powers with low levels of noise and distortion, at least at frequencies below 10kHz, at a very affordable price. But the amplifiers problems at the top of the audioband bother me. Predicting the subjective effect of this objective behavior is probably an exercise in futility, but I do wonder if it correlates with Herbs finding that the Emotiva sounded \"hard and 100% masculine\" through two of the speakers he tried with it.

       " '  Rotel RA-6000  .   amplifier by operating it at 1/8 power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the temperature of the top-panel grilles over the heatsinks was almost too hot to touch, at 130.4°F/54.2°C. The RA-6000 needs to be well-ventilated.Looking first at the line-level analog inputs, the Rotel RA-6000s maximum voltage gain from the loudspeaker output at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 22.14dB for the balanced input and 27.8dB for the unbalanced inputs. For the latter, the maximum gain was 1.28dB from the Pre output and 27.84dB from the headphone output. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, from all its outputs. The balanced input impedance was close to the specified 100k ohms, at 94k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 90k ohms at 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance is specified as 5.6k ohms; I measured 5.65k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 5.5k ohms at 20kHz. This is on the low side; tubed components with a high source impedance at low frequencies might sound a little lightweight.The source impedance from the Pre output was close to 100 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. The headphone outputs source impedance was a very high 665 ohms, again at all audio frequencies, which wont be optimal for low-impedance headphones. The loudspeaker output impedance was a very low 0.09 ohms at low and middle frequencies, increasing very slightly to 0.11 ohms at the top of the audioband. The variation in the Rotel amplifiers small-signal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.1dB  .Fig.1 Rotel RA-6000, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Into 8 ohms  , the RA-6000 offered a very wide small-signal bandwidth, which correlated with the short risetimes in the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into this load  . Commendably, despite the wide bandwidth, no overshoot or ringing was seen in the squarewave response. The increase in output impedance at very high frequencies meant that the response into 2 ohms   was down by 2dB at 100kHz, which is inconsequential.Fig.2 Rotel RA-6000, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum and with the tone controls bypassed; the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control.   Switching in the tone controls but with them set to do nothing reduced the level at 1kHz by 0.1dB. Fig.3 shows the effect of the controls set to their maximum and minimum positions. They cut or boost the bass and high treble by up to 14dB. The RA-6000s channel separation   was >80dB in both directions below 2kHz, decreasing slightly to 68dB at 20kHz.Fig.3 Rotel RA-6000, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to \"0\" and to maximum and minimum  The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio  , taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was 60.5dB  , improving to 75.9dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 78.6dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Rotel amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum   revealed the presence of low-level AC-related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics. The levels of these spuriae didnt change when I repeated the analysis with the volume control set to –12dB  .Fig.4 Rotel RA-6000, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum   and to –12dB    .Rotel specifies the RA-6000s maximum continuous power as 200Wpc into 8 ohms   and 350Wpc into 4 ohms  . With clipping defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%, I measured clipping powers with both channels driven of 250Wpc into 8 ohms   and 410Wpc into 4 ohms  . The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the distortion lies beneath the noisefloor below the clipping power.Fig.5 Rotel RA-6000, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms. Fig.6 Rotel RA-6000, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms  , 100W into 4 ohms  , and 200W into 2 ohms  . The THD+N was very low in the midrange and bass into 8 and 4 ohms but rose into 2 ohms and at high frequencies.   The distortion waveform was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  , which lay close to the level of the AC supply-related spuriae  . Intermodulation distortion was also very low in level, even at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Rotel RA-6000, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms   , and 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Rotel RA-6000, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0056% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Rotel RA-6000, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Rotel RA-6000, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the Rotels digital inputs, its coaxial and optical S/PDIF inputs accepted data sampled at all rates up to 192kHz. Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that the RA-6000s USB input accepted 16- and 24-bit integer data sampled at all rates from 44.1kHz to 768kHz. Apples USB Prober app identified the RA-6000 as \"ROTEL USB Audio 2.0\" from \"ROTEL,\" and the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode.All the digital inputs preserved absolute polarity. With the volume control set to its maximum, data representing a 1kHz tone at –20dBFS resulted in a level of 299.3mV at the Pre output and 6.35V at the headphone and speaker outputs. All the following measurements were performed at the Pre output with the loudspeakers turned off. However, even without the loudspeakers active, the amplifier went into protection mode with high-level, high-frequency digital input signals. To prevent this happening, I set the volume control to –12dB for the test results shown in  s.12 and 15.Fig.11 shows the RA-6000s impulse response with 44.1kHz data. It is typical of a short, minimum-phase reconstruction filter, with a small amount of ringing following the single full-scale sample. With 44.1kHz white-noise data  , the filter rolled off slowly above the audioband, not reaching full stop-band attenuation until 44kHz. The shape of the ultrasonic rolloff is familiar; it is typical of the filter used by MQA-capable devices for non-MQA data. With a 19.1kHz tone at –3dBFS  , the slow rolloff means that the aliased image at 25kHz is only suppressed by 17dB. The harmonics associated with the 19.1kHz tone are all very low in level, however. The Rotels frequency responses with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz   all followed the same basic shape: flat in the audioband then rolling off just below half the sample rate.Fig.11 Rotel RA-6000, impulse response  .Fig.12 Rotel RA-6000, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at –3dBFS   with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.13 Rotel RA-6000, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , and 192kHz    .The red trace in  .14 plots the error in the analog output level as a 24-bit, 1kHz digital tone steps down from 0dBFS to –140dBFS. The amplitude error is negligible until the signal lies below –100dBFS, which implies that the DAC resolution is not significantly greater than 17 bits. This was confirmed by the fact that an increase in bit depth from 16 to 24 with dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS   dropped the level of the RA-6000s noisefloor by around 9dB, which implies a resolution between 17 and 18 bits. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS, the waveform was symmetrical, with the three DC voltage levels described by the data well resolved  , though a small DC offset of 50ÊV was present. Repeating the measurement with undithered 24-bit data gave a rather noisy sinewave  .Fig.14 Rotel RA-6000, left channel, 1kHz output level vs 24-bit data level in dBFS  ; linearity error  .Fig.15 Rotel RA-6000, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit TosLink data  , 24-bit TosLink data    .Fig.16 Rotel RA-6000, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .As implied by the blue and cyan traces in  .12, harmonic distortion via the digital inputs was low, the second and third harmonics with a full-scale 50Hz tone both lying at –90dB  . With an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones sampled at 44.1kHz and peaking at –3dBFS, aliased images at 24.1kHz and 25.1kHz are present at close to –70dB  , but the intermodulation products are very low in level  .Fig.17 Rotel RA-6000, 24-bit TosLink data, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at –3dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .  RA-6000s rejection of word-clock jitter with undithered, 16-bit Miller-Dunn J-Test optical or coaxial data. The odd-order harmonics of the undithered Fs/192, LSB-level squarewave, particularly those at ±229.6875Hz, are higher than the correct levels, these indicated by the sloping green line in  .18. However, repeating this test with 16-bit J-Test data sent to the RA-6000s USB input gave a much better result  , as expected, given that the word clock is not embedded in the datastream with this input.Fig.18 Rotel RA-6000, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229.6875Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.19 Rotel RA-6000, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled 229.6875Hz: 16-bit USB data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.To test the Rotels MM-compatible phono input, I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding post on the Rotels rear panel, to obtain the lowest noise. The maximum gain at 1kHz was 49.6dB at the Pre output and 76.1dB at the headphone and the loudspeaker outputs. As with the digital-input testing, I performed all the phono-input testing using the Pre output and, other than S/N ratio, with the volume control set to –12dB in order to avoid the amplifier turning itself off with high-level, high-frequency signals.The Rotels phono input preserved absolute polarity at all three outputs. The input impedance, specified as 47k ohms, measured 64k ohms at 20Hz, 60k ohms at 1kHz, and 52k ohms at 20kHz. The phono inputs audioband RIAA correction was superbly accurate in the audioband, with excellent channel matching  , though with a slight rise in the low bass before rolling off to reach –3dB at 10Hz. The response rises above 20kHz, reaching +3dB at 100kHz. This behavior is too high in frequency and too low in level to imply the presence of the so-called Neumann 4th pole modification of the original RIAA curve, but it might slightly emphasize the audibility of record clicks by adding overshoot to the transient waveform.Fig.20 Rotel RA-6000, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a very good 71dB in both channels, ref. 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 74dB, while an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 80dB. Spectral analysis of the phono inputs low-frequency noisefloor revealed very low levels of random noise, but there were power supply-related spuriae present at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics.The phono inputs overload margins, measured at the Pre output and ref. 1kHz at 5mV, were superbly high at 23.5dB at 20Hz and 1kHz and 22.6dB at 20kHz. The phono inputs distortion signature was primarily odd-order harmonics, but even with an input signal of 25mV these all lay below –90dB  . Intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones was also low in level, even with a signal peaking just 9dB below the overload point  .Fig.21 Rotel RA-6000, phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, for 25mV input, measured at preamp output  .Fig.22 Rotel RA-6000, phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz with an input signal 9dB below the overload level  .The Rotel RA-6000s measured performance is typical of a well-designed, modern solid state integrated amplifier. It offers high power with low distortion and a well-managed gain architecture for all three types of inputs: line, digital and phono. Although the resolution of its D/A section is relatively limited, that should be put against the low noise and high overload margins of the moving magnet phono input.           ',\n",
       " 'All of the No.333s   using the balanced inputs. After a one-hour, 1/3-power preconditioning, the heatsinks were too hot to keep my hands on. The wideband S/N Ratio   measured a reasonable 62.5dB, this improving to 79.5dB when A-weighted. The channel separation   was better than 90dB below 5kHz, decreasing above that frequency to a still-good 70dB at 50kHz, due to capacitive coupling between the channels. The amplifiers voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 26.7dB, it didnt invert polarity, and its input impedance was approximately 100k ohms.The output impedance was low at around 0.037 ohms in the bass and midrange, rising to 0.046 ohms at 20kHz, meaning that the frequency response driving our simulated loudspeaker load   was effectively identical to that into a resistive load  . However, note the ultrasonic response rise, peaking by 1.7dB at 100kHz. This is related to the overshoot and damped ringing visible on the 333s squarewave response  ; both are due to a minor problem with the feedback circuit. I didnt note anything untoward in my auditioning, however, so I must assume that this measured behavior is benign  .Fig.1 Mark Levinson No.333, balanced mode, frequency response at 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.2 Mark Levinson No.333, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.It may also be related to the manner in which the THD+noise varies with frequency  . Although the distortion reading at these low power levels is very low, note the slight rise both at higher frequencies and into lower loads. I suspect, however, that this behavior is due to the amplifier starting to run out of closed-loop gain-margin at high frequencies. It, too, is probably benign. Fig.4 shows that even at high powers into 8 ohms, the harmonic content is primarily third-harmonic with noise. At high powers into lower impedances  , some higher harmonics appeared.Fig.3 Mark Levinson No.333, THD+noise vs frequency at  : 4W into 2 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, and 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.4 Mark Levinson No.333, 1kHz waveform at 132W into 8 ohms  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .The No.333s output spectrum, driving a low-frequency tone   at 232W into 4 ohms, is shown in  .5. The dominant harmonic is the third, at 150Hz, though this is still at a very low –90dB. At higher powers and into lower impedances, the fifth harmonic makes an appearance. Note that the only AC-supply harmonic evident in this graph is the 120Hz, at a low –98dB. The Levinson output spectrum driving a mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones into a 4 ohm load remained relatively clean until very high power levels. Even at 30V RMS with this difficult signal  , the 1kHz difference component was almost 100dB down, and the 18kHz and 21kHz intermodulation products were almost 80dB down.Fig.5 Mark Levinson No.333, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 232W into 4 ohms  . Note that the third harmonic at 150Hz is the highest in level, at –90dB  .Finally, the No.333 outperformed its power specification in a big way. As can be seen from  .6, it clipped   at 400W into 8 ohms   with both channels driven and a wall voltage of 117V. This almost doubled to 700Wpc into 4 ohms   with both channels driven, and almost doubled again at 1250W into 2 ohms  , one channel driven. Note that the AC line voltage drooped to 114V for these last two measurements, implying that with a \"stiff\" AC supply  , the No.333 will pump out even more watts.

       " '  Boulder 865s measured behavior using mainly Stereophiles loaner sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. s on an amplifier, I run it for 60 minutes at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms, which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. The Boulders top panel was quite warm at the end of this period, but soon thereafter the amplifier turned itself off, due, presumably, to thermal overload. Following that, it turned itself on, then off, and so on, indicating that its heatsinks thermal capacity is only just enough to pass this test. It is extremely unlikely that this will lead to any practical problems. Still, those using an 865 in home-theater systems would be well advised not to place it in a closet without adequate ventilation.The 865s maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms from its speaker terminals was a high 45.85dB, and the volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps. The maximum gain from the Auxiliary line-level output was a fairly high 20dB, sourced from an output impedance of 984 ohms. Both speaker and Auxiliary outputs preserved absolute polarity; ie, were non-inverting with pin 2 of the XLR jacks wired as hot. The 865s input impedance was a high 63k ohms at 1kHz, rising to 84k ohms at 20Hz and 73k ohms at 20kHz.The Boulders output impedance was a low 0.07 ohm at low and midrange frequencies, this rising slightly to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modification of the 865s frequency response due to the Ohms Law interaction between it and the source impedance of our simulated loudspeaker   remained within ±0.1dB limits. The 865s small-signal bandwidth is wide, at –3dB at 90kHz, and commendably didnt change with different volume-control settings. The amplifiers increasing source impedance in the top octave and above did reduce the ultrasonic bandwidth slightly, but the Boulders reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was nicely square, with no overshoot or ringing  . The 1kHz squarewave performance was nigh on perfect  .Fig.1 Boulder 865, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Boulder 865, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was excellent, measured with the volume control at \"0.0dB\"  , at better than 90dB in both directions below 1kHz, and still better than 80dB at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   was good but not great at 62.6dB, this improving to 69.3dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 71.8dB when A-weighted. This is not as good as the specified unweighted  ure of 108dB, ref. 150W into 8 ohms, which is equivalent to 86.2dB ref. 2.83V.Fig.3 plots the percentage of THD+noise in the Boulder 865s output while it drove an increasing level of a 1kHz tone into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The amplifier easily exceeded its specified maximum continuous power of 150Wpc into 8 ohms, not clipping   until 194W   with both channels driven. It just met the specified peak output power of 300Wpc into 4 ohms, delivering 308Wpc at 1% THD  . With one channel driven into 2 ohms, the amplifier turned itself off at 467W into 2 ohms  , as indicated by the truncated upper trace in  .3. The Boulder turned itself on again after I reduced the input level, but some residual crossover distortion was now apparent in its output. Cycling the amplifier off, then on again eliminated the crossover artefacts, but this behavior does suggest the 865 not be driven to high levels into low impedances of 2 ohms and below.Fig.3 Boulder 865, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4 ohms.I plotted the THD+N percentage against frequency at a level of 16V into 8 ohms, or 32W  . Though the measurement is dominated by noise below 4kHz or so into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , the THD does start to rise out of that noise above that frequency, if not to any significant level. Into 2 ohms, however, the distortion rises considerably above 1kHz, and the amplifier again shut itself off at the end of the time it took to take this measurement into that impedance  , which again suggests that the 865 is not optimized for driving impedances lower than 4 ohms.Fig.4 Boulder 865, THD+N   vs frequency at 16V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The waveform of that distortion is dominated by the subjectively innocuous second and third harmonics  —note how, even at the fairly high power level in this graph, the waveform is dominated by noise—though spectral analysis indicates that some higher-order harmonics are present  . The right channel is not quite as linear as the left, and in  .6 you can also see some power-supply–related spuriae below 1kHz. Though these components are all at a very low level, I couldnt eliminate them by experimenting with grounding, and they do contribute to the worse-than-specified S/N ratio. Halving the load impedance to 4 ohms but keeping the input voltage constant gave the spectrum shown in  .7. The distortion components havent risen by much, but the spectral line representing the 1kHz tone now has sidebands apparent at the supply-related frequency of ±120Hz and its harmonics. The amplifier is obviously under strain at this high a power into 4 ohms, even though it doesnt actually clip for another couple of dB.Fig.5 Boulder 865, 1kHz waveform at 93.5W into 4 ohms  , 0.0044% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Boulder 865, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 105W into 8 ohms  .Fig.7 Boulder 865, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 203W into 4 ohms  .The Boulder 865 did well on the demanding high-level, high-frequency intermodulation test  . Though some higher-order components can be seen, these are all at a low level, and the 1kHz difference component lies at –110dB  , which isnt going to disturb any listeners equanimity.Fig.8 Boulder 865, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .The Boulder 865 measures well, though it clearly is having to work hard driving high powers into low impedances.

       " '  Devialet D-Premier with Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain.   later, black-finish sample, serial no.00965, the mirror-finish no.00061 having been sent off for photography. Before testing an amplifier with a conventional class-B or -AB output stage, I precondition it by running it at one-third power for an hour, which thermally stresses the amplifier to the maximum extent. In theory, this test is irrelevant with the Devialet, but I did so anyway. At the end of the hour, the left side of the top panel was hot to the touch, at 131.4°F  , the right side a little cooler, at 114.3°F  . It might be efficient at converting wall current into speaker-driving power, but the D-Premier still runs hot. As Devialet warns in the D-Premiers manual, the amplifier needs to be well ventilated.I didnt test the phono inputs performance, as I didnt use it during my auditioning for this review. The phono stages sound and measured performance will be covered in a Follow-Up.The rotary volume control on the Devialets remote control covers a range of \"–97.5dB\" to \"+30.0dB\" in accurate 0.5dB steps. With the control set to \"+30.0,\" the voltage gain into 8 ohms for an analog source and a line input was a high 52.3dB. At \"0.0dB,\" the gain, of course, was 22.3dB. The analog inputs preserved absolute polarity  , and the analog input impedance was moderately low, at 14k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly at 20kHz to 12.5k ohms.Devialet specifies the D-Premiers output impedance as <0.001 ohm. I measured 0.04 ohm at all audio frequencies, but thus includes the impedance of the 6 of speaker cable I used for the test. But the fact that the D-Premier has an extraordinarily low output impedance can be seen in  .1, where the voltage drop as the load changes from 8 to 4 ohms, and the variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker, are each less than 0.1dB. Even with a 2 ohm load  , the level drops by less than 0.2dB in the audioband. With the D-Premier in its standard con uration, pressing the middle bottom button on the remote rolls off the low frequencies by 3dB at 20Hz  .Fig.1 was taken with the A/D converter that digitizes the analog inputs set to the default of 96kHz sampling. As a result, the response can be seen to drop like a stone above 40kHz, and a 10kHz squarewave has the distinctively rounded shape that is due to the absence of all harmonics above the third  . The 1kHz squarewave   has the usual time-symmetrical ringing visible preceding the start of each change in level  .Fig.1 Devialet D-Premier, analog frequency response with volume control at \"0.0\" at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , simulated loudspeaker    .Fig.2 Devialet D-Premier, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with A/D converter on analog inputs set to 96kHz sampling.Channel separation via the analog inputs was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 2.5kHz  . The D-Premier is specified as having a superb signal/noise ratio of 130dB, but without conditions or reference level given. My standard test with an integrated amplifier is to short-circuit the input but set the volume control to its maximum, which is very much the worst-case condition  . With its very high gain, the D-Premier is put at a disadvantage under these conditions.   wideband, unweighted S/N, ref. 1W into 8 ohms, to be a fairly low 47.1dB in the left channel and 48.5dB in the right. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these  ures to 51.6 and 52.3dB, respectively, while switching in an A-weighting filter gave further improvement, to 54.9 and 55.2dB. Reducing the level of the volume control will improve these ratios, of course, and  .3 shows the low-frequency spectrum of the D-Premiers output while it reproduced a 1kHz tone at 100W into 8 ohms with the volume control set to \"0.0dB.\" The noise floor is a little higher in the left channel than in the right, and rises by 10dB as the frequency decreases. The only other thing to note in this graph is the presence of a power-supply–related tone at 120Hz, but at –110dB ref. the level of the 1kHz tone, this is inconsequential.Fig.3 Devialet D-Premier, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .The Devialet is specified as having a maximum output power of 240Wpc into, I understand, 6 ohms  . Fig.4 shows how the THD+noise percentage changes with output power into 8 ohms.1 The downward slope of the trace below the \"knee\" indicates that what distortion is present is actually buried in the noise floor. We define clipping as the power when the THD reaches 1%;  .4 shows that the D-Premier was putting out 180Wpc into 8 ohms   at 1% THD. Fig.5 shows the behavior into 4 ohms. The trace is similar in shape to that into 8 ohms, except that, very unusually, it slopes backward above the \"knee,\" which occurs at 245.8Wpc into 4 ohms  . What is happening is that, with sustained drive at very high power, either the power supply starts to collapse or the DSP protection starts to operate, both reducing the power delivery. Because of this behavior, I didnt test the maximum power into 2 ohms.Fig.4 Devialet D-Premier, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Devialet D-Premier, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I plotted how the output power changes with frequency at a level, 20V, equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms, where the power supply would remain stiff. The results are shown in  .6. Below 10kHz, the measurement is dominated by noise; above that frequency, and unlike a conventional class-D amplifier, there is almost no rise in THD. However, I havent shown the behavior into 2 ohms as, again, the power-supply voltage would start to decrease after a few seconds operation at 20V.Fig.6 Devialet D-Premier, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The lower trace in  .7, taken at a level just below the discontinuity in  .4, confirms that actual distortion in the D-Premiers output is buried beneath the noise. However, FFT analysis reveals there to be harmonics present at high powers, albeit at a very low level  . The two highest in level, the second and third harmonics, lie at –106dB   and –104dB  , respectively, with all other harmonics lying at or below –110dB  . Conventional class-D amplifiers tend to perform poorly when fed high-frequency intermodulation. By contrast, the D-Premier, given a mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 20W into 4 ohms  , performed well on this test  . The 1kHz difference tone lay at almost –110dB, and the higher-order intermodulation products were all below –90dB  .Fig.7 Devialet D-Premier, 1kHz waveform at 150W into 8 ohms  , 0.0022% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Devialet D-Premier, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Devialet D-Premier, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 20W peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the D-Premiers digital inputs, I measured its performance at the speaker outputs, as that is how I used the amplifier. With the volume control set to \"0.0dB,\" a full-scale 1kHz tone resulted in a level of 30.79V into 8 ohms, equivalent to a power of 118.5Wpc, just under 2dB below clipping into this load. This suggests that, with digital inputs, the volume control should be kept below \"+1.5dB.\" The digital inputs were again non-inverting. Although the S/PDIF and AES/EBU inputs locked on to datastreams with sample rates from 32 to 192kHz, including 88.2 and 176.4kHz, the \"AIR WiFi input was restricted to 96kHz and below.Fig.10 shows the D-Premiers frequency response for its digital inputs with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz. Unusually, the 192kHz rate gives only a slight increase in bandwidth compared with 96kHz. Digital channel separation   was similar to that for analog inputs. To remain consistent with the measurements of DAC resolution I have performed since 1989, I used a swept-bandpass technique to generate the traces in  .11, which represent a dithered tone at –90dBFS with 16- and 24-bit data. Repeating the analysis with a modern FFT technique gave a similar picture  , confirming that the only power-supply–related spuriae present was a small amount of 120Hz, at –110dB. The increase in bit depth from 16 to 24 with both these graphs dropped the noise floor by around 12dB, implying a resolution of 18 bits or so, which is good, if not quite up to the standard set by the best-measuring standalone processors, such as the Bricasti M1, MSB Diamond DAC IV, NAD M51, or Weiss DAC202.Fig.10 Devialet D-Premier, digital frequency response at –12dBFS into 8 ohms with volume control set to \"0.0\" and data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.11 Devialet D-Premier, 1?3-octave spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, with: 16-bit S/PDIF data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.12 Devialet D-Premier, FFT-derived spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, with: 16-bit S/PDIF data  , 24-bit data  .There is some peculiar scalloping of the noise floor visible with 24-bit data in the right channel in  .12  . I am not sure what this means. Repeating the analysis with 16- and 24-bit data over WiFi using the D-Premiers AIR input and the Devialet iTunes streamer gave an anomalous result  . With 16-bit data, the 1kHz tone lay at the correct –90dBFS in the left channel  , the noise floor lay at the correct level, and no harmonics were visible. However, the right channels noise floor   lay about 5dB higher in level. Even more peculiarly, sending 24-bit data gave only a slight lowering of the noise floor in the left channel  , but a raising of the floor in the right channel  . I tried rebooting the D-Premier by unplugging it from the wall and then powering it back up, but this did not restore proper operation with 24-bit data. This was with v.1.4.0 of Devialets AIR client; I imagine it is something that can be fixed in a future software or firmware release.Fig.13 Devialet D-Premier, FFT-derived spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, with: 16-bit AIR data  , 24-bit data  .With S/PDIF and AES/EBU data, the D-Premiers reproduction of an undithered sinewave at exactly –90.31dBFS was essentially perfect  , with undithered 24-bit data giving a well-defined sinewave  .Fig.14 Devialet D-Premier, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit S/PDIF data  .Fig.15 Devialet D-Premier, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit S/PDIF data  .Feeding the D-Premier a 24-bit version of the 44.1kHz Miller-Dunn J-Test via one of the TosLink inputs gave the spectrum shown in  .16. No data-related jitter components are visible. However, a pair of sidebands around the 11.025kHz tone at ±120Hz can be seen. Although these lie below –120dBFS   and are presumably irrelevant to sound quality, they perhaps result from some power-supply interference at the DACs voltage-reference pin. Repeating the test with Devialet AIR WiFi data gave rise to the same 120Hz sidebands  , but now some broadening of the central peak can be seen. And as with  .13, the left channels noise floor   is not much lower than the 16-bit floor, while the right channels floor is significantly higher in level  . I suspect that this loss of resolution via WiFi is the reason I ended up preferring using a standalone USB-S/PDIF converter for the bulk of my auditioning of the D-Premier.Fig.16 Devialet D-Premier, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit data via TosLink from AP SYS2722  .

Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Other than its slightly anomalous behavior via WiFi, the Devialet D-Premiers measured performance is a testament to what can be obtained with switching-amplifier technology. However, sustained high-power operation into speakers with an impedance of 4 ohms or below is best avoided.— John AtkinsonFootnote 1: Because the D-Premiers output stage includes a class-D element, I performed all the distortion measurements using Audio Precisions AUX-0025 high-power, passive low-pass filter between the amplifiers output and the SYS-2722s input. But this really didnt appear to be necessary; unlike with the class-D amplifiers we reviewed in December, I could detect no ultrasonic switching noise in the D-Premiers output.           ',\n",
       " '     . Before taking any measurements,   Ayre by running it for 60 minutes at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms, which is very much the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or class-A/B output stage. Like the original MX-R, the MX-R Twenty got hot, the temperature of its heatsink fins reaching 140.3°F   and the top of its case 116.1°F  . The THD+noise measured 0.03% with the amplifier cold, and stabilized at 0.0178% with the amplifier hot. While the Ayres unusual heatsink has sufficient thermal conductivity to be effective for an amplifier of this power rating, the MX-R does need to be used in a well-ventilated space.The voltage gain into 8 ohms was a little lower than the specified 26dB, at 25.1dB, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity, its XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance is specified at a very high 2 megohms. Though it is difficult to measure an impedance this high with any accuracy, my measurement indicated that the input impedance was at least 1M ohm across the audioband. Like the original MX-R, the output impedance was higher than usual for a solid-state design: 0.26 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.28 ohm at 20kHz, with a slight dependence on the load impedance.  This higher-than-usual output impedance results in a slight   variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  . The MX-R Twenty, however, offers a very wide small-signal bandwidth, especially into higher impedances. Into 8 ohms  , for example, the upper –3dB point is above 200kHz, the limit of this graph, and at 200kHz the response is down by just 1.5dB. This wide bandwidth correlates with the excellent shape of a 10kHz squarewave  , with very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing. A 1kHz squarewave was reproduced with an essentially perfect shape  .Fig.1 Ayre MX-R Twenty, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Ayre MX-R Twenty, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Ayre MX-R Twenty, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The original MX-R was a quiet amplifier, but the Twenty handily exceeded it. With the amplifiers input shorted to ground, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   measured an extraordinarily low 109.9dB, this improving to 112.1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 113dB when A-weighted. The blue trace in  .4 shows a low-frequency spectral analysis of the MX-R Twentys output while it drove a 1kHz tone into 8 ohms. The individual random noise components all lie close to –140dB, and while power-supply–related spuriae can be seen at 120 and 240Hz, these lie at a superbly low –121 and –129dB, respectively. The red trace in  .4 shows what happens when the output power is increased to 100W into 8 ohms. Supply-related sidebands now appear at ±120 and ±240Hz, but these are still at or below –112dB  .Fig.4 Ayre MX-R Twenty, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at: 1W into 8 ohms  , 100W into 8 ohms    .Figs. 5–7 respectively plot how the percentage of THD+N in the Ayres output changes into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. With our definition of clipping as being when the THD+N reaches 1%, the MX-R Twenty comfortably exceeds its specified power of 300W into 8 ohms  . With the wall voltage at 122.4V AC, the Ayre clipped at 360W into this load   and the distortion remained below 0.02% below 100W. Into 4 ohms the amplifier clipped at 595W  , and into 2 ohms it clipped at 720W  , though the distortion was higher at lower powers into these loads.   This can also be seen in  .8, which plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at 8.975V, which is equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms, 20W into 4 ohms, and 40W into 2 ohms. However, the increase in distortion into lower impedances was not as great as it had been with the original MX-R.Fig.5 Ayre MX-R Twenty, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Ayre MX-R Twenty, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Ayre MX-R Twenty, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Fig.8 Ayre MX-R Twenty, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.975V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .At low powers, the distortion was primarily the third harmonic  , but at high powers this was joined by both the second harmonic, at almost the same level  , and by a regular series of higher-order products. These were associated with low-level crossover distortion that was visible on the oscilloscope screen. The original MX-R had been better behaved in both this respect and when it came to high-frequency intermodulation at high powers. While the second-order difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lay at a low –84dB  , some higher-order products were visible, though it is fair to note that almost all of these lie at or below –90dB  .Fig.9 Ayre MX-R Twenty, 1kHz waveform at 6W into 4 ohms, 0.057% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Ayre MX-R Twenty, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Ayre MX-R Twenty, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Ayre MX-R Twenty, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .The Twenty version of the MX-R is significantly quieter than its predecessor while offering a slightly different distortion signature. But it still packs a great deal of power into its relatively tiny frame. It is a true high-resolution amplifier.           ',\n",
       " 'VTLs Siegfried Series II Reference has both balanced and single-ended inputs and can be operated in tetrode or triode output-stage modes, each with four levels of negative feedback. Because fully characterizing its performance in every one of the 16 possible conditions would be very time consuming, I performed a limited set of measurements in all 16, and then a more complete set using the balanced input and in both triode and tetrode modes, each with minimum and maximum feedback—which VTL respectively calls Low Damping Factor   and Max Damping Factor  . I used my top-of-the-line   system  .The Siegfried IIs balanced and unbalanced inputs both preserved absolute polarity   with the rear-panel Phase switch set to \"0,\" and offered the same voltage gain. In triode mode  , the gain ranged from 30.1dB with MDF to 33.8dB with LDF. Gain in tetrode mode   was a little higher, at 31.7dB/MDF and 36.5dB/LDF. The balanced input impedance was a usefully high 90k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still-high 76k ohms at 20kHz. As expected, the singled-ended input impedances were half the balanced  ures.With its dozen 6550 output tubes, the Siegfried IIs output impedance was low for a tubed design. The lowest impedance was in triode/MDF mode, at 0.88 ohm in the midband and 0.9 ohm at the extremes of the audioband. As a result, the variation in the amplifiers frequency response due to the interaction of this impedance with that of our standard simulated loudspeaker remained within ±0.5dB limits  . This graph also indicates that the Siegfried II rolls off cleanly above the audioband, reaching –3dB at 130kHz into 8 ohms  . The output impedance rose a little with each reduction of feedback, reaching 1.36 ohms at 1kHz and 1.4 ohms at the frequency extremes in the LDF condition, when the response variation was ±1dB and the HF rolloff was now –3dB at 80kHz  . The output impedance in tetrode mode was only slightly higher than in triode mode, varying from 0.9 ohms at 1kHz/MDF to 1.53 ohms 1kHz/LDF. The variations in response with our simulated loudspeaker were therefore of the same order  , but the ultrasonic response was more extended in tetrode mode, with the –3dB point into 8 ohms varying from >200kHz/MDF   to 150kHz/LDF.Fig.1 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/MDF, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.3 VTL Siegfried II Reference, tetrode/MDF, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Perhaps more important, in tetrode/MDF, the ultrasonic rolloff has a sharper corner that correlates with the small degree of overshoot and damped oscillation in the Siegfried IIs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave in this condition  . For comparison,  .5 shows the VTLs reproduction of the 10kHz squarewave in triode/LDF. The waveform is superbly square, with no incipient instability, and the 1kHz squarewave in this mode is essentially perfect  . These last two graphs are a testament to the quality of the Siegfrieds output transformer.Fig.4 VTL Siegfried II Reference, tetrode/MDF, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.5 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.6 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.With its high gain, even with MDF, the Siegfried II is not the quietest high-power amplifier I have measured. The unweighted wideband signal/noise ratio, measured with the input shorted and ref. 1W into 8 ohms, varied from 75.4dB in tetrode/LDF to 81.7dB in triode/LDF. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these ratios by a couple of dB, while switching in an A-weighting filter gave ratios of 83.2dB in tetrode/LDF, 85.3dB in triode/LDF, 87.9dB in tetrode/MDF, and 89.5dB in triode/MDF. Spectral analysis of the amplifiers low-frequency noise floor   indicated that the primary source of noise was magnetic interference from the AC transformer at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, though its fair to note that even the highest-level component, at 180Hz, is still down by 85dB from the 1W output level and will not be audible.Fig.7 VTL Siegfried II Reference, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .VTL specifies their amplifiers rated powers into 5 ohms, which is awkward for reviewers: our test loads come in multiples of 4 ohms. I therefore measured the Siegfried IIs maximum power into 4 and 8 ohms in tetrode and triode modes, each with LDF and MDF. The clipping power   wasnt affected by the amount of feedback, though the percentage of THD was a little higher below clipping with LDF. Fig.8 shows how the THD+N varies with output power into 8 ohms with the Siegfried II set to triode/LDF. The distortion is very low at low powers, starts to rise above the noise floor above a few hundred milliwatts, remains less than 0.1% below 25W, and reaches 1% at 250W  . Fig.9 shows the 4 ohm behavior, again in triode/LDF. The amplifier now clips at 315W  , but the distortion is still respectably low at lower powers. Fig.10 shows the Siegfried IIs behavior into 8 ohms in tetrode/LDF. The low-power distortion is even lower than in triode mode, and the amplifier now clips at 425W  . Into 4 ohms in tetrode mode  , the Siegfried clipped at 600W  .Fig.8 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.9 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.10 VTL Siegfried II Reference, tetrode/LDF, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.11 VTL Siegfried II Reference, tetrode/LDF, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Figs. 12 and 13 show how the percentage of THD+N varies with frequency into 8, 4, and 2 ohms at a level where I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise. Fig.12 shows the behavior in triode/LDF,  .13 in tetrode/LDF. The 8 ohm distortion   was low in both modes, with tetrode slightly lower overall. There is also only a slight rise in THD toward the top of the audioband. But as the load impedance drops, the THD rises overall, and the increase at high frequencies rises further. Comparing these two graphs, and looking at the graphs taken with MDF  , suggests that while the Siegfried II offers the lowest measured distortion in tetrode/MDF, the amplifier deals better with low impedances in triode mode, at all DF settings.Fig.12 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, THD+N   vs frequency at 6.34V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.13 VTL Siegfried II Reference, tetrode/LDF, THD+N   vs frequency at 9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Also to be considered is the fact that, in triode mode, the distortion in the midrange is primarily the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  , while in tetrode mode some higher-order harmonics appear  . The differences are more pronounced at low frequencies and higher powers. In triode mode  , the second and third harmonics are equally strong, at –60dB   each, while in tetrode mode   the third and fifth harmonics are strongest, at, respectively, –52dB   and –68dB  .Fig.14 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, 1kHz waveform at 1.3W into 8 ohms, 0.024% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.15 VTL Siegfried II Reference, tetrode/LDF, 1kHz waveform at 2W into 8 ohms, 0.011% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.16 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.17 VTL Siegfried II Reference, tetrode/LDF, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Despite its decreasing linearity at high frequencies and at high powers, the Siegfried II performed relatively well when tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level a few dB below visual clipping on an oscilloscope. Fig.18 was taken in triode/LDF into 4 ohms, which was the worst case. Even so, the 1kHz difference component lies at –53dB  , and the higher-order products, at 18 and 21kHz, are a couple of dB lower in level.Fig.18 VTL Siegfried II Reference, triode/LDF, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .VTLs Siegfried Series II Reference is large and massive, and its measured performance shows that it is, indeed, a powerhouse. Even with its negative feedback set to its minimum, the amplifier still offers low levels of distortion at the kinds of power levels likely to be seen in practice. Though the best linearity is to be obtained in tetrode mode, the spectral signature of the distortion and the way in which the amplifiers behavior changes with decreasing load impedance suggests that triode mode will be preferred.

       " '  big Chord SPM 14000 by running it at 172W into 8 ohms for an hour.   The measured THD+noise percentage at the beginning of that period was 0.0108%. After 20 minutes, some high-order components appeared in the distortion waveform, still at a very low level, but these subsided at the 30-minute mark, with the final THD level at 0.015%, this almost pure third harmonic. The rear heatsinks were around 140°F   at the end of the hour, the side panels cooler than this.The Chords voltage gain was a high 29.75dB into 8 ohms, this the same for both unbalanced and balanced drive. Neither of the left-hand input jacks   inverted signal polarity; both of the right-hand jacks did so.   Given that the two RCA jacks are wired with opposite polarity, it might be thought that inserting a shorting plug into the unused jack would give the lowest possible noise with unbalanced drive. When I tried that, however, the amplifier turned itself off.The unbalanced input impedance was a usefully high 52k ohms in the bass and midrange, this dropping slightly at 20kHz, to 35k ohms. The balanced input impedance was a constant 104k ohms across the audioband. The output impedance, including 6 of speaker cable and taken from one of the pairs of  WBT binding posts, which I assumed were in parallel—the amps terminal panel was devoid of any legends—was 0.23 ohm at all audio frequencies. This resulted in a moderate ±0.25dB of frequency-response modification with our standard dummy loudspeaker  . The Chords small-signal bandwidth was wide, with a high-frequency –3dB point of 111kHz, correlating with the excellent 10kHz squarewave reproduction  . But as also can be seen from  .1, the amplifiers bandwidth decreased with decreasing load impedance, the output being 0.7dB down at 20kHz into 2 ohms. This graph was taken using balanced drive; the unbalanced set of responses was identical.Fig.1 Chord SPM 14000, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.2 Chord SPM 14000, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The level of the SPM 14000s noise floor depended on whether it was being driven by balanced or unbalanced signals. With balanced drive, I measured a moderate signal/noise ratio of 64.2dB, ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This was a wideband, unweighted  ure; the A-weighted ratio was a good 79.3dB. However, with unbalanced drive, while the A-weighted ratio decreased only slightly, to 76.3dB, the unweighted, wideband  ure was significantly worse than balanced, at 49.75dB. This was why I had assumed that the undriven, inverting RCA jack should have a shorting plug inserted, as some balanced amplifiers require the unused signal phase to be referenced to ground. But as I wrote earlier, the Chord went into protection when I tried this. As PB didnt remark on any issues with background noise, I assume he used the VTL TL-7.5 preamplifiers balanced outputs to feed the SPM 14000s.To my surprise, though the Chord is definitely a powerhouse of an amplifier, it didnt quite meet its specified power at clipping  . Into 8 ohms, I measured 525W  , which is almost 3dB below the specified power of 1kW and just over 1dB less than what I had earlier understood to be the specified power, 700W  . The shortfall is probably insignificant in my opinion, though I did check by repeating the measurement the next day with the amplifier cold rather than hot  . It is also relevant to note that I dont hold my AC wall supply constant with a Variac for my power testing. With no signal, the wall voltage in my test lab was 125V; this dropped to a still high 121V with the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms, 119V with it clipping into 4 ohms, and 117V into 2 ohms. The 4 ohm clipping power was 980W  , the 2 ohm power 1450W  —as I said, the amplifier is still a powerhouse!The manner in which the distortion percentage changes with output power is shown in  .3. The downward slopes of the traces below a few tens of watts in this graph indicate that the THD+N percentage is dominated by noise at these levels. Only above deliveries of 80W or so into 8 and 4 ohms does the Chords true distortion start to rise above the background noise. Into 2 ohms, however, the THD rises above 30W, which suggests that the amplifier is working hard into this load. Even so, the THD remains well below 0.1% for almost all its working power range.Fig.3 Chord SPM 14000, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Because of the very low level of true THD at small-signal levels, I plotted the Chords THD+N against frequency at 20V output, equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms. The results are shown in  .4. The 8 ohm trace in this graph correlates with the result in  .3; however, both the 4 ohm and 2 ohm traces are significantly worse. I have no idea what these are due to, other than the fact that the amplifier was very hot for these tests, while it had cooled down considerably by the time I performed the low-impedance clipping measurements, which I do at the very end of the testing, in case the amp being tested breaks. The THD rises above the audioband into all three loads, presumably due to the decreasing gain margin at ultrasonic frequencies rendering negative feedback less effective. But again, the THD+N percentage is well below 0.01% in the audioband.Fig.4 Chord SPM 14000, THD+N  vs frequency at 20V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Even at high levels into low impedances, that distortion is the subjectively benign third harmonic  . Looking at the spectrum of a high-power, low-frequency tone  , the third harmonic lies at –84dB  , with the second harmonic next highest in level below –90dB  . All other harmonics are below –100dB. Keeping the signal level the same but halving the load impedance gives the spectrum shown in  .7: the second harmonic has risen by 6dB, the third by 12dB. Note also that a 120Hz component just touches the –100dB line. I couldnt eliminate this by changing the grounding between my Audio Precision analyzer and the amplifier. Nevertheless, it is negligible.Fig.5 Chord SPM 14000, 1kHz waveform at 230W into 4 ohms  , 0.035% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Chord SPM 14000, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 235W into 8 ohms  .Fig.7 Chord SPM 14000, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 450W into 4 ohms  .With its decreasing linearity at the top of the audioband, I wasnt surprised to see the Chord produce a 1kHz difference component at –70dB when driving a mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms close to visible clipping on the oscilloscope  . Halving the load impedance   didnt change the level of the 1kHz product, but did change the level of the higher-order products at 18kHz and 21kHz, to –76dB. Even so, this is very much a worst-case situation; this behavior shouldnt be an issue under normal circumstances.Fig.8 Chord SPM 14000, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 720W peak into 8 ohms  .The slight shortfall in its power delivery aside, the Chord SPM 14000 delivers excellent measured performance.

       " '  Cary SI-300.2d    . Usually, I precondition an amplifier by running it with both channels driven at one-third power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes. After just 20 minutes, however, the temperature of the Carys internal heatsink, which can be touched, was 192.8°F  ; that of the top panel, just behind the faceplate, was 120.6°F  . After another 20 minutes, the SI-300.2d turned off its outputs, and \"PROTECT\" appeared on its display. I let the amplifier cool down, then turned it back on and continued testing. But the Carys heatsinking is smaller than it theoretically needs to be for an amplifier capable of delivering 300Wpc into 8 ohms.Looking first at the performance of the SI-300.2d via its analog inputs: The volume control operated in accurate 1dB steps, and the voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum measured 30.7dB for both balanced and unbalanced input signals, this increasing by 4dB rather than the specified 6dB when I pressed the Mode button on the remote control. The preamplifier outputs appeared to be just under unity gain, sourced from a highish 895 ohms. The unbalanced inputs were non-inverting, but the balanced inputs appeared to be wired with pin 3 rather than pin 2 hot, as they inverted absolute polarity. The unbalanced input impedance across the audioband was 23k ohms, the balanced impedance twice that value, as expected.The Carys output impedance   was 0.13 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.18 ohm at 20kHz. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker was fairly low, at ±0.1dB  . This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum of \"60\"; there was no difference in the performance with the control set to \"40,\" and as the Carys response was down by 3dB at 110kHz, its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was excellent, with relatively short risetimes  .Fig.1 Cary SI-300.2d, frequency response with volume control set to its maximum at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Cary SI-300.2d, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation below 1kHz was good rather than great, at >70dB, but at 20kHz decreased to 46dB L–R and 50dB R–L. Spectral analysis of the SI-300.2ds low-frequency noise floor   revealed the presence of both odd- and even-order harmonics of the 60Hz AC supply frequency, but as these lay at or below 100dB below 1W into 8 ohms, they will be inconsequential. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio ref. that level, taken with the inputs shorted to ground but the volume set to its maximum, was a respectable 80.3dB, improving to 92.6dB when A-weighted.Fig.3 Cary SI-300.2d, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Carys SI-300.2d exceeded its specified maximum power of 300Wpc into 8 ohms  , clipping   at 337W with both channels driven into 8 ohms  . The specified maximum power into 4 ohms is 450Wpc   but the measured clipping power into this load was 500Wpc  . I didnt test the clipping power into 2 ohms, as a burst of ultrasonic noise appeared on the tops and bottoms of the waveform at high powers into this load, and I was concerned about breaking the amplifier.Fig.4 Cary SI-300.2d, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Cary SI-300.2d, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Figs. 4 and 5 reveal that the THD+N was respectably low at powers below 10W and, even at a higher power, remained below 0.1% into 8 ohms across the audioband  , with the right channel driving 4 ohms  . The left channel was less linear than the right into low impedances and above 2kHz or so, however. The residual distortion waveform   implies a complicated mix of second and third harmonics, and spectral analysis reveals that higher-order harmonics are also present at higher powers  . Intermodulation distortion was relatively low  , with the difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying 70dB below the signals peak level  .Fig.6 Cary SI-300.2d, THD+N   vs frequency at 17.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Cary SI-300.2d, 1kHz waveform at 11W into 8 ohms, 0.022% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Cary SI-300.2d, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Cary SI-300.2d, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the SI-300.2ds digital inputs, a 1kHz tone at 0dBFS resulted in a level from the preamplifier output of 1.873V with the volume control set to its maximum, and 57.95V from the speaker outputs into 8 ohms. However, as the power amplifier was clipping slightly at this level, it appears that the digital inputs gain architecture is close to optimal. As the Carys speaker outputs cant be turned off, I reduced the volume control by 10dB for the rest of the digital-input testing, and disconnected the test load from the speaker outputs to avoid damaging the amplifier with full-scale digital signals. All of the digital test results refer to the signal at the Carys preamplifier output.As well as the Audio Precisions digital outputs, I used WAV and AIFF test-tone files sourced via USB from Pure Music 3.0 on my MacBook Pro computer running on battery power. Apples USB Prober utility identified the Cary as \"xCORE USB Audio 2.0\" from \"XMOS,\" and revealed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. Apples AudioMIDI utility showed that, via USB, the SI-300.2d accepted 24-bit integer data sampled at all rates from 44.1 to 384kHz.The Cary offers a wide range of upsampling options, but not with USB data, which is what I use to examine a DACs impulse response and wideband spectral analyses.   The SI-300.2ds impulse response with 44.1kHz data   reveals the reconstruction filter to be a minimum-phase type. Wideband spectral analysis with 44.1kHz white noise at –4dBFS   shows this filter to have the expected sharp cutoff above 20kHz, and the distortion harmonics of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   are all low in level.Fig.10 Cary SI-300.2d, impulse response  .Fig.11 Cary SI-300.2d, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .When  Carys frequency response with TosLink and AES/EBU data, and with and without upsampling, I uncovered some problems. Fig.12 shows the responses without upsampling and with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz; while the 44.1kHz response drops sharply above 18kHz, the response at all three rates rolls off a little early in the top audio octave, and the ultrasonic response with 192kHz data extends no higher than with 96kHz data. Switching in PCM upsampling didnt change these responses  , but when I looked at the effect of DSD upsampling, it didnt matter whether I chose DSD64, DSD128, or DSD256—the original PCM data appeared to be first downsampled to 44.1kHz. This is shown graphically in  .14, where the blue and red traces plot the response with 96kHz data upsampled to 384kHz, the cyan and magenta traces the response with the same 96kHz data upsampled to DSD256.Fig.12 Cary SI-300.2d, no upsampling, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.13 Cary SI-300.2d, PCM upsampling, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.14 Cary SI-300.2d, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at 192kHz with upsampling to: 384kHz  , DSD256    .Fig.15 shows a spectral analysis of the SI-300.2ds noise floor with a 24-bit/1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16- and 24-bit AES/EBU data. The increase in bit depth drops the noise floor by around 27dB, suggesting DAC resolution of between 20 and 21 bits, which is excellent. The Carys reproduction of an undithered 16-bit/1kHz tone at exactly –90.31dBFS   clearly shows the three DC voltage levels described by the data, as well as the minimum-phase behavior of the reconstruction filter. Switching in upsampling gave a waveform more typical of a time-symmetrical FIR filter  .Fig.15 Cary SI-300.2d, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.16 Cary SI-300.2d, no upsampling, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.17 Cary SI-300.2d, 352.8kHz upsampling, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .When   behavior of the SI-300.2ds digital input with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones peaking at 0dBFS, the result were also anomalous. Fig.18 shows the spectrum with 44.1kHz data and upsampling bypassed. Intermodulation products are all low in level, but there is some modulation of the noise floor around the tones. By contrast,  .19 shows the spectrum with the same data upsampled to 352.8kHz. The noise-floor modulation has disappeared, but some higher-order products are now present. And with DSD128 upsampling, the spectrum is just perverse  .Fig.18 Cary SI-300.2d, no upsampling, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.19 Cary SI-300.2d, 352.8kHz upsampling, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.20 Cary SI-300.2d, DSD128 upsampling, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .The spectrum of the SI-300.2ds rejection of word-clock jitter, with 44.1Hz J-Test data and upsampling bypassed  , shows the same modulation of the noise floor as in the intermodulation tests. This obscures the off-order harmonics of the low-frequency, LSB-level squarewave, other than a pair to either side of the spike representing the 11.025kHz tone. There is also a pair of sidebands present at ±3.8kHz, in the left channel only. Neither these sidebands nor the noise-floor modulation was present when I repeated the test with USB data  , but the sidebands remained when I upsampled TosLink data to 352.8kHz  , or repeated the test with 24-bit data  .Fig.21 Cary SI-300.2d, no upsampling, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  .

Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.The Cary SI-300.2ds measured performance is a mixed bag. The amplifier itself is a straightforward, competently engineered, solid-state, class-A/B design, and while its heatsinking is, in absolute terms, inadequate for so powerful an amplifier, this will probably not be a problem in practical use unless the Cary is used for dancing at a party. Its USB input offers excellent performance, as KM found. However, with S/PDIF and AES/EBU data and upsampling, which KM didnt audition, some of the measurements were perverse—see the Bryston review elsewhere in this issue for how these measurements should look—while others suggested that the sound will change somewhat arbitrarily, depending on the input sample rate and/or on which upsampling rate and/or format have been chosen.

       " '  Krell Solo 575      . Before measuring it,   amplifier by running it at one-third the specified power, 190W, into 8 ohms for 30 minutes.   The amplifiers cooling fans turned on immediately at this power level and were noisier than I was anticipating. At the end of 30 minutes, the top panel was warm; only the slotted area where the fans vent was hot, at 137.4°F  . The percentage of THD+noise at this power level was 0.009% with the amplifier cold, 0.0088% with it fully warmed up.The Solo 575s voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 26.5dB with both balanced and unbalanced input signals.   Unusually, the Krell inverted absolute polarity for both its balanced and unbalanced inputs. Although the specified input impedance was very high, at 100k ohms unbalanced and 200k ohms balanced, the measured impedance was very much lower, at close to 4.9k ohms for both inputs across the audioband. This is not an amplifier that should be used with capacitor-coupled tube preamplifiers, though it would not have been a problem with MFs darTZeel preamp. The output impedance was very low, at 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.11 ohm at 20kHz.  As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker   was very low. The Solo 575s small-signal bandwidth was wide, with a –3dB frequency greater than 100kHz. The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was therefore essentially perfect  , with short rise times and no overshoot or ringing. The unbalanced frequency response   was identical at high frequencies, but had a small   rise at 10Hz. Measured with the balanced input shorted to ground, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was very good, at 78.2dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms. With an A-weighting filter, the S/N improved to 89.1dB. Considering its very high output power  , this is a high–dynamic-range amplifier. Looking at the low-frequency noise floor as the Krell drove a 1kHz tone at 2.83V into 8 ohms: While some power-supply–related spuriae can be seen  , even the highest in level, at 120Hz, lies at just –100dB  .Fig.1 Krell Solo 575, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Krell Solo 575, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Krell Solo 575, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 4 and 5 respectively plot the THD+N percentage in the Solo 575s output against power in watts into 8 and 4 ohms. Although the Krells specified maximum power into these loads is very high, at a respective 575W   and 900W  , the amplifier exceeded those powers, clipping at 625W into 8 ohms   and 910W into 4 ohms  .   Although I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests, the Solo 575 clipped at 1050W into 2 ohms  . This is a powerhouse of an amplifier!Fig.4 Krell Solo 575, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Krell Solo 575, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.It also offers very low distortion. I plotted how the THD+N percentage changes with frequency at a level—12.65V, equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms, 40W into 4 ohms, and 80W into 2 ohms—at which I could be sure that I was measuring actual distortion, not noise. Even so, the level of distortion was very low  , especially into 8 ohms, and rose only slightly at the top of the audioband.Fig.6 Krell Solo 575, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .And that distortion was almost purely third-harmonic in nature  , with some higher-order odd harmonics appearing at high powers and low frequencies  . Even so, other than the third harmonic at –80dB  , these all lay at or below –90dB  . Intermodulation distortion was similarly low  .Fig.7 Krell Solo 575, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.0068% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Krell Solo 575, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 300W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Krell Solo 575, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 150W peak into 8 ohms  .It is difficult not to be impressed by how Krells Solo 575 measured. Amplifiers dont get much better.           ',\n",
       " '  Roksan Kandy K2 BT    .   on an amplifier, I run it for an hour with both channels operating at one-third its specified maximum power into 8 ohms. Like the earlier Kandy K2, reviewed by Art Dudley in May 2010, the K2 BT got very hot after 30 minutes, at which point I cut short the conditioning.The first test I usually perform with an amplifier after this preconditioning period is to examine its behavior with squarewaves. The original K2s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was excellent, with a very short risetime  . By contrast, the K2 BTs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   had long risetimes, equating to a limited ultrasonic response. It turned out that the Roksans frequency response depends to a larger extent than usual on its volume-control setting. Fig.2 shows the amplifiers response with the volume control set to 9 oclock  , 12 oclock  , and 3 oclock  . At the lowest setting of the control, the output is down by 3dB at 95kHz, but with it set to 12 oclock, which is where Id measured the squarewave response, the –3dB point has moved down to 24kHz. Increasing the volume past that point increased the ultrasonic bandwidth, and at 3 oclock the –3dB point was 35kHz, while with the control set to its maximum  , the –3dB output lay at 115kHz. Note, too, that the channel matching also changes with the setting of the volume control, the maximum difference between the channel gains   occurring with the volume control set to 12 oclock.Fig.1 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.2 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with volume control set to: 9 oclock  , 12 oclock  , 3 oclock    .Fig.3 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .In most respects, the K2 BT measured very similarly to the K2, with an input impedance of around 23k ohms, an output impedance of <0.1 ohm at low and middle frequencies, and a maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms of 37.3dB, 5.8dB of which came from the preamplifier section. The K2 BT also preserved absolute polarity for all its inputs, including phono. Though the maximum power listed in the BTs specifications was greater, at 140Wpc vs 125Wpc, the measured power at clipping into 8 ohms   was 140Wpc  , compared with 137Wpc for the original K2. The clipping power into 4 ohms was also very similar, at just under 200Wpc  , as was the distortion signature, which was predominantly second harmonic  . The phono inputs RIAA error  , assessed at the preamplifier output jacks, was identical to that of the earlier version, with minimal error in the audioband but a slight rise at ultrasonic frequencies.Fig.4 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 4 ohms, 0.046% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .But its the Bluetooth input that distinguishes this version of the Kandy from the one that AD reviewed, and  performance of the K2 BTs Bluetooth input using both an iPad 2, which uses the default AAC codec, and my 2012 MacBook Pro, which has the better-performing aptX codec  . Because the Bluetooth connection uses a lossy codec, measuring its performance is no straightforward task.  Playing files with iTunes with its volume control set to the maximum, the Roksans analog output waveform, assessed at the preamplifier output jacks, was severely clipped. I had to back off the MacBooks volume control to approximately 90% before the K2 BTs output waveform was free from clipping; at that point, the level was 2.3V. So if you use the Roksans BT input, keep your sources volume control down. However, when I sent the K2 BT dithered 16-bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, there was no 1kHz content in the spectrum of the amplifiers output. This was presumably because Id set the laptops volume control to 90%, to avoid clipping, which had dropped the tone below the 16-bit quantization floor. Resetting my laptops volume control to its maximum and repeating the analysis gave a spectrum with a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  . However, the noise floor is hashy-looking.Fig.8 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16-bit data sourced from MacBook Pro running aptX    .The Bluetooth connection is limited to sample rates of 44.1 and 48kHz and a bit depth of 16. The BT inputs impulse response was that of a conventional, time-symmetrical, linear-phase reconstruction filter  , while the frequency response with 44.1kHz data featured a gentle rolloff in the top audio octave that reached –1dB at 20kHz  . With a full-scale 1kHz tone  , the aptX codecs limited bit budget results in the noise floor rising below 7kHz, while with the gapped, multitone test signal that I discussed in the Arcam review  , the codec preserves as much resolution in the midrange and low treble, where human hearing is sensitive, compared with the top two octaves, where hearing sensitivity decreases. Tested with the 16-bit J-Test signal, which comprises a high-level tone at one-quarter the sample rate and an LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave, the rise in the noise floor in the top octaves masks both any jitter artifacts and the odd-order harmonics of the squarewave  .Fig.9 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, Bluetooth frequency response at 44.1kHz    .Fig.10 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, data sourced from MacBook Pro running aptX    .Fig.11 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, spectrum of 16-bit multitone signal, data sourced from MacBook Pro running aptX    .Fig.12 Roksan Kandy K2 BT, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data sourced from MacBook Pro running aptX  .  As I wrote in the Arcam review, the aptX codec throws away absolute resolution in favor of preserving a random noise floor because this will be less annoying with music. But the true test of a lossy codec is to listen to it, which is what HR did, of course.           ',\n",
       " '  Exposure XM5 integrated amplifier and D/A processor    . Usually before performing any testing, I run an amplifier for an hour at one-third power into 8 ohms, which is thermally the most stressful condition for a design with a class-AB output stage. With the Exposure XM5, however, I cut short this preconditioning after 15 minutes. The temperature of the amplifiers bottom panel, to which the output devices are fastened, had already reached 163.6°F  , and I was concerned that the XM5 would go into thermal runaway. The top panel was also hot, at 105.1°F  . Clearly, this little amplifier doesnt have enough heatsink capacity for sustained operation at highish powers. The owner should ensure that its well ventilated.Looking first at the line-level analog inputs: With the volume control at its maximum setting, the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 36dB from the speaker terminals, 12.06dB from the preamplifier outputs. The line inputs preserved absolute polarity   from both outputs. The input impedance was 14.7k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly to 12.4k ohms at 20kHz. The preamplifier output had an appropriately low output impedance of 68 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz, but this rose to 430 ohms at the bottom of the audioband.The output impedance at the speaker terminals   was a low 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.55 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modulation of the Exposures frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.05dB  . The amplifiers output is down by 0.5dB at 20kHz and rolls off above 30kHz, which lengthens the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  . However, there is no overshoot or ringing. Note the excellent channel matching in  .1, taken with the volume control set to its maximum. Commendably, the matching was preserved at lower settings of the control, as was the frequency response.Fig.1 Exposure XM5, line input, volume control at max, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Exposure XM5, line input, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The XM5s channel separation was modest, at 63dB in both directions from 100Hz to 20kHz. With the line inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured 80.7dB  . Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 83.1dB in the left channel, 87.8dB in the right, and an A-weighting filter increased both ratios by another 4dB. Fig.3 shows the low-frequency spectrum of the XM5s output while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms. The highest-level spuriae are at the AC power-line frequency of 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, presumably due to magnetic coupling from the power transformer. In so small an enclosure, the low-level circuitry cant be kept far enough away for this not to occur.Fig.3 Exposure XM5, line input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Exposure specifies the XM5 as delivering a maximum power of 60Wpc into 8 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive in both channels, the XM5 exceeded that spec, delivering 70Wpc into 8 ohms  . With both channels driven into 4 ohms, the amplifier clipped at 106W  . I didnt test the clipping power into 2 ohms, as I was concerned the amplifier would overheat.Fig.4 Exposure XM5, line input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.5 Exposure XM5, line input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms, both channels driven.I looked at how the XM5s THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a level of 6.93V, which is equivalent to 6W into 8 ohms, 12W into 4 ohms, and 24W into 2 ohms. The distortion levels were very low in the bass and midrange in both channels into 8 ohms  , though with the usual rise at higher frequencies due to the circuits decreasing open-loop bandwidth. However, while the right channel performed almost as well into 4 ohms  , the left channel offered higher distortion  , and even greater levels into 2 ohms  . The shape of the distortion-spuriae waveform in the right channel   suggests that the second harmonic was the highest in level, but with higher-order harmonics present. Spectral analysis indicated that this was the case into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , but that the third and fifth harmonics were the highest in level in the left channel  . Both second-order and higher-order intermodulation products at 20Wpc into 8 ohms were very low in level  , perhaps due to the amplifiers restricted ultrasonic bandwidth.Fig.6 Exposure XM5, line input, distortion   vs frequency at 6.93V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Exposure XM5, line input, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.006% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Exposure XM5, line input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 40Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Exposure XM5, line input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the XM5s digital inputs, the optical S/PDIF input locked to datastreams with sample rates up to 96kHz, the coaxial inputs up to 192kHz. All digital inputs preserved absolute polarity. Apples USB Prober utility identified the XM5 as \"xCORE-AUDIO Hi-Res 2\" from \"XMOS,\" and confirmed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the USB port could handle 16- and 24-bit integer data at all sample rates up to 192kHz. With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in output levels of 1.28V at the preamp outputs and 20.1V into 8 ohms at the speaker outputs. The latter is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, which is 1.4dB below the measured clipping power into this load. As is often the case with integrated amplifiers offering digital inputs, these have around 10dB too much gain compared with the line-level analog inputs. I continued testing the Exposures digital inputs from the preamplifier outputs with the volume control set to 12 oclock.The XM5s impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that its reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the response rolled off above the audioband, reaching full stop-band suppression at 24kHz. The aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   is suppressed by 83dB, though harmonics of this tone can be seen, with the second the highest in frequency at –57dB  . The Exposures digital frequency response with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz follows the same basic shape at each sample rate, with a sharp rolloff with 44.1kHz data  . The response at the two higher sample rates rolls off earlier than expected, presumably due to the amplifiers limited ultrasonic bandwidth.Fig.10 Exposure XM5, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.11 Exposure XM5, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.12 Exposure XM5, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Channel separation for the digital inputs was better at lower frequencies than that of the analog inputs. It measured >76dB below 1kHz, though it decreased to 50dB in both directions at the top of the audioband. When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor dropped by about 12dB, meaning that the XM5 offers around 18 bits worth of resolution. However, these spectra reveal a lot of supply-related spuriae. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was symmetrical, though some HF noise was present. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a slightly noisy sinewave  .Fig.13 Exposure XM5, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.14 Exposure XM5, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit TosLink data  .Fig.15 Exposure XM5, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit TosLink data  .Intermodulation distortion via the XM5s digital inputs was low  . When   digital inputs rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit J-Test data, the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were all at the correct levels  . However, many other sidebands are visible, these spaced at 120Hz intervals, which suggests that they might be due to an insufficiently filtered voltage at the DAC chips reference pin.Fig.16 Exposure XM5, digital input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.17 Exposure XM5, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.As I was finishing these jitter measurements, the Exposure XM5 overheated and shut down. I had to let it cool down before I could examine the phono inputs behavior. For this, I floated the analyzer outputs and ran a separate ground connection from the speaker binding post next to the amplifiers phono input RCAs, which gave the lowest level of noise. With the volume control at its maximum setting, the voltage gain at 1kHz measured 78.8dB from the speaker outputs and 54.9dB from the preamplifier outputs, these gains appropriate for moving-magnet cartridges. Both outputs preserved absolute polarity with phono input signals. The phono input impedance was 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly to 39k ohms at 20kHz, these impedances also appropriate for MM cartridges.The phono-stage RIAA error was low in the treble, but featured a 0.7dB plateau in the midrange and a low-frequency rolloff reaching –3dB at 13Hz  . Fig.18 also reveals a slight   imbalance in favor of the left channel. With the phono inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to 12 oclock, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured a good 64dB in both channels. An A-weighting filter increased the ratios to 70dB in both channels. Phono-input overload margins were good at lower frequencies, at 15dB at 20Hz and 12dB at 1kHz, but dropped to 9.7dB at 20kHz. Both harmonic distortion   and intermodulation distortion   were very low in level, even at input levels 6dB higher than usual.Fig.18 Exposure XM5, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .Fig.19 Exposure XM5, phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave at 10mV input, DC–10kHz  .Fig.20 Exposure XM5, phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100mV peak input  .Exposures XM5 offers generally good measured performance, though I was less impressed by the performance of its digital inputs.

       " '  Exposure 3010S using Audio Precisions top-model SYS2722 system   for most of the tests, with some use made of the older AP System One. As usual,   amplifier by running both channels at one-third power into 8 ohms, which maximally stresses an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. The normal preconditioning period is one hour, but the Exposure turned itself off after just 20 minutes. While the  chassis was warm, the area of the top cover above the internal heatsink was almost too hot to keep my hand on. After the amplifier had cooled down, I turned it on again, and all seemed well. But this does suggest that the Exposures heatsinking is inadequate for sustained use at levels around 40Wpc, which could well happen if the amplifier is used to provide music at a party.The maximum voltage gain at the 3010Ss speaker output jacks was 41.15dB into 8 ohms, which is typical for an integrated amplifier. As the 3010S also has preamplifier output jacks, I could measure the maximum gain at these: it was 17.25dB, which implies a power-amplifier gain of 23.9dB. The preamplifier outputs were non-inverting and had a source impedance of 48 ohms at high and middle frequencies, rising to 410 ohms in the low bass. The amplifier as a whole, and the phono stage, also preserved absolute polarity.The input impedance of the line-stage jacks was moderately high at 21k ohms at low frequencies, dropping slightly to 18k ohms at the top of the audioband. The phono-stage input impedance was fixed at 47k ohms at 20Hz, dropping slightly to 45.6k ohms at 1kHz and 37k ohms at 20kHz. Measured at the tape output jacks, the phono stage had a gain of 40.6dB, which is appropriate for use with moving-magnet phono cartridges or moving-coils with a step-up transformer, which was how AD auditioned the unit. The phono sections signal/noise ratio   was good at 68.6dB, and the overload margin, again ref. 5mV at 1kHz, was superb across the audioband, at 26dB or greater. The only disappointing aspect of the Exposures phono stage was its unflat RIAA correction  , which showed a 1–1.5dB boost in the midrange. I suspect that it is this error that gave rise to ADs feeling that the 3010S sounded \"overly dark, overly heavy\" via its phono input.Fig.1 Exposure 3010S, phono-stage RIAA error  .The Exposures output impedance at the speaker jacks was a low 0.1 ohm across the audioband. As a result, the modification of its frequency response driving our standard simulated loudspeaker   remained within ±0.1dB limits  . Channel matching was excellent. The amplifier starts to roll off at the top of the audioband, with the response at 20kHz down by 0.75dB, which is inconsequential, though it does slow a little the leading edges of a 10kHz squarewave  . The 1kHz squarewave response   was perfect, with flat tops confirming the excellent low-frequency extension seen in  .2. Channel separation via the line stage   was very good, at >90dB R–L and >80dB L–R below 2kHz.Fig.2 Exposure 3010S, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.3 Exposure 3010S, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The S/N ratio for the line input, measured with the input shorted but the volume control wide open, was 73dB ref. 1V  , this improving slightly to 78.6dB when A-weighted. Claimed to deliver 110Wpc into 8 ohms  , the Exposure easily exceeded that maximum power rating, with 140Wpc   available at clipping into that load  . The maximum power into 4 ohms was 200Wpc  , again with both channels driven. Fig.4 shows how the THD+N percentage present in the amplifiers output varies with power into 8 and 4 ohms; the shape of the traces in this graph indicates that, below a few tens of watts, the distortion present is actually below the amplifiers noise floor with this 1kHz signal.Fig.4 Exposure 3010S, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4 ohms.I therefore measured how the amplifiers THD+N varied with frequency and load impedance at a fairly high output level of 10V. The results are shown in  .5: both channels show a rise in THD in the treble, but the left channel was less linear than the right. For example, the right channel was more linear into 4 ohms   than the left channel into 8 ohms  . Similarly, the right channel into 2 ohms   was more linear than the left into 4  . I have no way of knowing whether this channel mismatch is due to a lapse in quality control or to a problem in design, circuit layout, or component selection, but fortunately, the spectral content of the distortion is heavily low-order in nature  . Fig.7 was taken 6dB below clipping into 4 ohms; the amplifier is definitely working hard under these conditions, as revealed by the presence of power-supply components at 120 and 240Hz. Despite its use of a massive toroidal power transformer, which coupled hum into Arts moving-coil step-up transformer, the 3010Ss output is commendably free of magnetically induced spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics. The internal shielding works.Fig.5 Exposure 3010S, THD+N   vs frequency at 13.15V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.6 Exposure 3010S, 1kHz waveform at 23.3W into 4 ohms  , 0.0111% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Exposure 3010S, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Finally, with the left channels reduced linearity at high frequencies, it was not surprising that it performed less well than the right channel on the demanding high-power, high-frequency intermodulation test  . The 1kHz difference component reached an okay –80dB in the left channel  , but an excellent –97dB in the right  .Fig.8 Exposure 3010S, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 120W peak into 4 ohms  .Other than the unflat RIAA equalization and the difference in channel linearity, the Exposure 3010Ss measured performance was excellent.           ',\n",
       " '  using   system  . As the Theta Prometheus has a switching output stage that produces ultrasonic noise that would overload the Audio Precisions input circuitry, I carried out most of the tests using, ahead of the analyzer, an Audio Precision AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter. Usually, before measuring an amplifier, I run it for an hour at one-third power into 8 ohms—the most thermally stressful condition for a class-B output stage. But as the Prometheus has a class-D output, that preconditioning is irrelevant. Even so, I subjected serial number 050085 to this test to ensure that it had settled into its long-term operating condition.  The Thetas voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same, at 27.7dB, for its balanced and unbalanced inputs, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity for both inputs  ; its XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot. At 90k ohms, the balanced input impedance was very close to the specification of 94k ohms at low and middle frequencies, though it dropped to 84k ohms at the top of the audioband. The unbalanced input impedance was half these values.The Prometheuss output impedance was 0.11 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly at 20kHz to 0.13 ohm. The modification of the Thetas frequency response, which results from the interaction between this impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was very low  . This graph also shows that the ultrasonic rolloff doesnt change significantly as the load impedance drops to 2 ohms, with a –3dB point of 40kHz. However, a small peak at 77kHz becomes a little more pronounced into higher impedances. Without the Audio Precision low-pass filter, the Thetas reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms is obscured by switching noise  . With the filter, however, this noise is eliminated  , and a 10kHz squarewave can be seen to have a small degree of overshoot that correlates with the slight response peak at 77kHz  . Commendably, however, no ringing is associated with this overshoot.Fig.1 Theta Prometheus, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Theta Prometheus, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms without AP LPF.Fig.3 Theta Prometheus, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with AP LPF.Without the Audio Precision low-pass filter, and with the Thetas input short-circuited, there was 321mV of ultrasonic noise present in the amplifiers output, with a center frequency of 453kHz. With the filter, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms, was 76.3dB, this improving to an excellent 94dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband—and improving even more, to 95.6dB, when the measurement was A-weighted. With the amplifier passing signal, however, there was the noise level depended to some extent on the output power. Fig.5, taken with the auxiliary AP low-pass filter    , shows low-frequency spectra of the Thetas output while it reproduced a 1kHz tone at 1W  , then 100W  , into 8 ohms. Spuriae are present at the AC-related frequency of 60Hz and its odd harmonics, which increase with the power level. This behavior usually suggests magnetic interference from the amplifiers power transformer, but as the spuriae are still all at or below –110dB   at the high power, their presence will be of only academic interest.Fig.4 Theta Prometheus, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with AP LPF.Fig.5 Theta Prometheus, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W   and 100W   into 8 ohms  .Fig.6 reveals that the Thetas distortion starts to rise above the audioband noise floor just below 10W into 8 ohms, but remains below a low 0.003% until the start of actual waveform clipping. Even then, the rise in THD is relatively gradual, and the amplifier doesnt reach 1% THD until 320W  , just over 1dB higher than the rated 250W into 8 ohms  . Into 4 ohms  , the Prometheus delivers 600W   at 1% THD rather than the specified 500W, though this graph shows that the amplifier is less linear below clipping into this load. Into 2 ohms  , the Theta still easily exceeded its specified maximum power of 850W, delivering 980W  .  Fig.6 Theta Prometheus, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Theta Prometheus, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Theta Prometheus, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.To be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise, I examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at a fairly high level, 20V, equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms. Fig.9 reveals that the Prometheus is still very linear below the mid-treble region at this level, even into 4 ohms  . However, the distortion rises considerably into 2 ohms  , and in the top two octaves into the higher impedances, though it still remains below 0.08%.Fig.9 Theta Prometheus, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Into 8 ohms at moderately high power, the distortion is predominantly third harmonic  , though at just 0.0024%, this, again, will be of only academic interest. As the current increases, the third harmonic is joined by even-order harmonics  , but these are all at lower levels. Intermodulation distortion is also very low, even at high powers into 4 ohms  , with the 1kHz difference product associated with tones at 19 and 20kHz lying 100dB below the peak signal level  .Fig.10 Theta Prometheus, 1kHz waveform at 60W into 8 ohms, 0.0024% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Theta Prometheus, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.12 Theta Prometheus, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .The measured performance of Theta Digitals Prometheus is superb, even for an amplifier with a class-D output stage. Its similar to that of the more expensive MBL Corona C15 monoblock, which I reviewed in June 2014, which shouldnt be surprising—the MBL also uses a custom version of the Hypex output module designed by the very talented Bruno Putzeys.

       " '  one Pass Labs XA60.8   for an hour at one-third its specified maximum power of 60W into 8 ohms—thermally, the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. By the end of the hour, the top panel was warm, at 96.4°F  , and the side-mounted heatsinks were a little hotter, at 109.1°F  .   The XA60.8 ran a little cooler than the XA60.5 I reviewed in January 2014, probably due to its larger heatsinks.     . The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was 25.3dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs  , meaning that the XA60.8 will output 1W into 8 ohms with a drive signal of 155mV. The amplifier was non-inverting   with both inputs. Its input impedance was usefully higher than that of the XA60.5, at 49k ohms unbalanced and 100k ohms balanced at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to 38k ohms at 20kHz for unbalanced signals.  The XA60.8s output impedance, including 6 of speaker cable, was 0.07 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.1 ohm at 20kHz. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was just ±0.1dB  . Into an 8 ohm resistive load  , the XA605s response was flat up to 20kHz, then rolled off to reach –3dB around 120kHz. The response rolled off a little earlier into lower impedances, but was still just 0.3dB down at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . With this wide a small-signal bandwidth, the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured short risetimes and a well-squared shape  .Fig.1 Pass Labs XA60.8, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Pass Labs XA60.8, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground, was an excellent 80.9dB. This improved to 81.8dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband—and further still, to 93.6dB, when the measurement was A-weighted. This is a quiet amplifier. Fig.3 indicates that both the odd and even harmonics of the 60Hz power-supply frequency were present, though these all lay at or below –100dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Pass Labs XA60.8, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Specified as putting out 60W into 8 ohms and 120W into 4 ohms  , the XA60.8 considerably exceeded that power, delivering, at 1% total harmonic distortion  , 150W into 8 ohms  , 240W into 4 ohms  , and 380W into 2 ohms  . The THD begins to rise above the noise floor at high powers, but remains at or below 0.1% below the specified output power. The percentage of THD then slowly rises with increasing power, suggesting that the XA60.8 has only a small amount of corrective feedback.Fig.4 Pass Labs XA60.8, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Pass Labs XA60.8, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Pass Labs XA60.8, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 9V, a level where I could be sure, from the earlier measurements, that I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise. The THD+N was extremely low in the midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  , and only just above 0.1% into 2 ohms  . It rose linearly as the frequency increased, the three traces converging in the high treble—which suggests that the circuit has limited open-loop bandwidth.Fig.7 Pass Labs XA60.8, THD+N   vs frequency at 9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the XA60.8s distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous low-order variety. Fig.8 shows the waveform of the THD spuriae at two-thirds the specified power; it suggests that the third harmonic is predominant, though at low frequencies at this power   the second harmonic is highest in level, at –72dB  . With a 1kHz signal, the second harmonic remains at this level, but the third has risen to –63dB  . Some higher-order harmonics can also be seen in  .10, but all are much lower in level than the second and third harmonics.Fig.8 Pass Labs XA60.8, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.072% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Pass Labs XA60.8, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 40W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Pass Labs XA60.8, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 40W into 8 ohms  .As with the XA60.5, the XA60.8s top-octave decrease in linearity seen in  .7 was associated with some higher-order intermodulation products that were fairly high in level when the XA60.8 was asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen  . However, the subjectively more objectionable second-order product at 1kHz is almost 20dB lower, at –78dB  . At lower powers, the intermodulation products were all much lower in level  .Fig.11 Pass Labs XA60.8, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Pass Labs XA60.8, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 2W peak into 4 ohms  .The measured performance of the Pass Labs XA60.8 is very similar to that of the XA60.5. Both are well-engineered amplifiers that deliver more usable power than their modest specifications suggest.           ',\n",
       " '  on an amplifier, I precondition it by running both channels for 60 minutes at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms, which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or-AB output stage. At the end of that hour, the Krell FBIs entire chassis—not just the large vertical heatsinks on its sides—was too hot to touch. This is an amplifier that needs plenty of ventilation. The THD+noise percentage with the amplifier stone cold was 0.0142%; by the end of the hours warmup, this had dropped to 0.0067%.Without a signal generator having a current-source output, I couldnt perform any tests using the FBIs current-mode   input; instead, I used its conventional balanced and unbalanced inputs. Looking first at the preamplifier outputs, these offered a sensible maximum gain of 4dB for an unbalanced signal, sourced from a constant 100 ohms across the audioband. The FBI as a whole offered a maximum gain of 36.4dB into 8 ohms with both balanced and unbalanced sources, which is as specified but lower than usual for an integrated amplifier. The input impedance was extremely high across most of the audioband, at 200k ohms unbalanced and 400k ohms balanced, these  ures dropping slightly but inconsequentially at 20kHz.   All inputs preserved absolute polarity; ie, were non-inverting.The output impedance   was very low, at 0.08 ohm at low and midrange frequencies. It rose very slightly, to 0.11 ohm at 20kHz, but this will be inconsequential. The modification of the amplifiers frequency response due to the interaction between its source impedance and the modulus of the speakers impedance was less than ±0.05dB  . This graph also shows that the small-signal audioband response is flat, with a sensible ultrasonic rolloff reaching –3dB at 122kHz. This bandwidth was identical with both balanced and unbalanced sources, and didnt change with the volume-control setting. The FBIs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured very short risetimes and was commendably free from overshoot and ringing  . The 1kHz squarewave   was perfectly, er, square.Fig.1 Krell FBI, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.2 Krell FBI, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was very good, at better than 96dB below 1kHz, though it did decrease 76dB at 20kHz, due to the usual capacitive coupling. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum was a good 76.5dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms, this improving to 87.1dB when A-weighted, which is close to the specified 108dBA ref. clipping power when you add the amplifiers voltage gain to the 2.83V  ure.The FBI is specified as being able to deliver 300Wpc into 8 ohms  . However, plotting the output power against the THD+N percentage   shows that the FBI actually delivered 430Wpc into 8 ohms at 1% THD, which is a significant 1.6dBW higher. With both channels driven, the amplifier clipped at 667W into 4 ohms  . Even though the clipping power with one channel driven into 2 ohms was 1020W  , slightly below the specified 1200W, I dont keep my AC wall voltage consistent for this test, which had drooped with the amplifiers current draw. The FBI will deliver all the power anyone could need.Fig.3 Krell FBI, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Note from  .3 that the THD level above a handful of watts into the lower impedances is higher than into 8 ohms. This can also be seen in  .4, which plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at 8V, a level where the actual distortion is about to emerge from the background noise. The THD doubles with each halving of the load impedance, though in absolute terms it does remain low overall. There is only a small rise in the top two octaves of the graph, suggesting that the Krell FBI has a commendably wide open-loop bandwidth.Fig.4 Krell FBI, THD+N  vs frequency at 8V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms  .At moderate power levels into 8 ohms   the distortions harmonic content is almost pure third harmonic, which will be subjectively innocuous. Even at one-third the clipping power  , only the third harmonic is evident. However, not only does the third harmonic rise when the load impedance is reduced, the fifth and seventh harmonics appear  , though its fair to say that these remain low in absolute terms. And even with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones close to clipping into 4 ohms, intermodulation distortion remains very low  .Fig.5 Krell FBI, 1kHz waveform at 13W into 8 ohms  , 0.00975% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Krell FBI, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 120W into 8 ohms  .Fig.7 Krell FBI, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 234W into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Krell FBI, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 550W peak into 4 ohms  .It was a pleasure to measure such a well-engineered amplifier as Krells FBI. Quiet, powerful, stable, and well-behaved even into low impedances, it is a paradigm of what an integrated amplifier needs to do. If only it werent quite so heavy—carrying it down the steps of Freds brownstone to my car, then down the stairs from my driveway to my test lab, I began to appreciate the virtues of amps with featherweight class-D output stages!           ',\n",
       " 'I performed measurements on the Roksan Attessa  .   amplifier by operating it at 1/8 power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the top panels temperature was 108.4°F/42.4°C and that of the grille over the heatsinks almost too hot to touch, at 134.4°F/55.9°C. The Attessa needs sufficient ventilation.Looking first at the line-level analog \"Variable Input\" and with the sensitivity set to \"Low\" with the MaestroUnite app, the Roksan Attessas maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was 34.9dB from the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms, 5.85dB from the Pre output, and 11.85dB from the headphone output with the sensitivity set to \"Mid.\" The amplifier preserved absolute polarity, ie, it was noninverting from its loudspeaker, headphone, and Pre outputs. The input impedance was 25k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and 23.6k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone outputs source impedance was a usefully low 6 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. From the Pre output the impedance was 23 ohms, again at all audio frequencies. The loudspeaker output impedance was a very low 0.09 ohms at low and middle frequencies, increasing very slightly to 0.17 ohms at the top of the audioband. The variation in the Roksan amplifiers small-signal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.1dB  . Into resistive loads  , the Attessas frequency response rolled off above the audioband. The fastest rolloff was into 2 ohms  , the output being down by 3dB at 39kHz. There is the beginning of a boost at frequencies below 20Hz in this graph; the measurements in our sister magazine Hi-Fi News indicated that this boost reached +9.2dB at 3Hz.Fig.1 Roksan Attessa, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control with all three outputs. I found no overshoot or ringing with the Attessas reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . The Attessas channel separation   was 80dB in both directions below 3kHz, decreasing slightly to 68dB at 20kHz.Fig.2 Roksan Attessa, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio  , taken with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was 66.5dB  , improving to 71.7dB, left, and 68.4dB, right, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and by another 2.4dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Roksan amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum   revealed the presence of AC-related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics. These were higher in the right channel   than the left  , correlating with the different S/N ratios in the two channels. The levels of these spuriae didnt change when I repeated the analysis with the volume control set to –12dB, though the level of random noise dropped by the same 12dB.Fig.3 Roksan Attessa, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum    .Roksan specifies the Attessas maximum power as 80Wpc into 8 ohms   and 130Wpc into 4 ohms  . With clipping defined as being when the THD+noise reaches 1%, I measured clipping powers of 80Wpc into 8 ohms   and 128Wpc into 4 ohms   with both channels driven.   The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the actual distortion lies beneath the noisefloor below clipping.Fig.4 Roksan Attessa, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Roksan Attessa, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency into 8 and 4 ohms at 12.64V, which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms   and 40W into 4 ohms  . The THD+N was very low into both impedances, though a little higher in the right channel   than the left  . The distortion waveform was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  , which lay close to the level of the AC supply–related spuriae  . Intermodulation distortion was also very low in level  .Fig.6 Roksan Attessa, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.64V into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Roksan Attessa, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.04% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Roksan Attessa, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 40Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Roksan Attessa, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the digital inputs, the coaxial S/PDIF input accepted data sampled at all rates up to 192kHz; TosLink was restricted to 96kHz data. All the digital inputs preserved absolute polarity. With the volume control set to its maximum, data representing a 1kHz tone at –20dBFS resulted in a level of 819.2mV at the headphone output, 11.47V at the speaker outputs.   All the following measurements were performed at the headphone output.Fig.10 shows the Attessas impulse response with 44.1kHz data. It is typical of a short, minimum-phase reconstruction filter, with a small amount of ringing following the single full-scale sample. With 44.1kHz white-noise data  , the filter rolled off slowly above the audioband, not reaching full stop-band attenuation until 31kHz, but with then a scalloped noisefloor. With a 19.1kHz tone at –3dBFS  , the slow rolloff means that the aliased image at 25kHz is only suppressed by 9dB, and other, lower-level aliased products can be seen both in the audioband and between 60kHz and 70kHz. The harmonics associated with the 19.1kHz tone are all very low in level, however. The Roksans frequency responses with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz   all followed the same basic shape, with a 1dB rolloff at 20kHz.Fig.10 Roksan Attessa, impulse response  .Fig.11 Roksan Attessa, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at –3dBFS   into 100k ohms with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.12 Roksan Attessa, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , and 192kHz    .The red trace in  .13 plots the error in the analog output level as a 24-bit, 1kHz digital tone steps down from 0dBFS to –140dBFS. The amplitude error is negligible until the signal lies below –120dBFS. An increase in bit depth from 16 to 24 with dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS   dropped the level of the Attessas noisefloor by 12dB, which implies a DAC resolution of around 18 bits. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS, the waveform was symmetrical, with the three DC voltage levels described by the data cleanly resolved  . Repeating the measurement with undithered 24-bit data gave a well-formed if rather noisy sinewave  .Fig.13 Roksan Attessa, left channel, 1kHz output level vs 24-bit data level in dBFS  ; linearity error  .Fig.14 Roksan Attessa, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit TosLink data  , 24-bit TosLink data    .Fig.15 Roksan Attessa, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  Fig.16 Roksan Attessa, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  As implied by the blue and cyan traces, in  .11, harmonic distortion via the digital inputs was very low, the second harmonic of a full-scale 50Hz tone lying at –104dB  , left, and –114dB  , right  . With an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones sampled at 44.1kHz and peaking at 0dBFS, a large number of high-level aliased images were present. Reducing the signal level by 3dB eliminated most of these images, leaving those at 24.1kHz and 25.1kHz the highest in level   and all the others at or below –90dBFS.Fig.17 Roksan Attessa, 24-bit TosLink data, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 0dBFS into 100k ohms  .Fig.18 Roksan Attessa, 24-bit TosLink data, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at –3dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .With undithered, 16-bit J-Test optical data, the odd-order harmonics of the undithered Fs/192, LSB-level squarewave mostly lay a little higher than the correct levels, these indicated by the sloping green line in  .19. While the levels of the sidebands at ±229.6875Hz are much higher, repeating this test with data sent to the Attessa over my network with BluOS lowered these two sidebands by 10dB.Fig.19 Roksan Attessa, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.The Roksans MM-compatible phono input preserved absolute polarity at all three outputs. The phono inputs audioband RIAA correction was superbly accurate  , though with a slight rise in the very low bass. The input impedance measured 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping slightly to 40k ohms at 20kHz. The maximum gain at 1kHz, with the sensitivity set to \"Mid\" with the MaestroUnite app, was 55.5dB at the Pre output, 61.4dB at the headphone output, and 84.5dB at the loudspeaker outputs. I performed all the subsequent testing using the headphone output and, other than S/N ratio, with the volume control set to –20dB to avoid clipping the output.Fig.20 Roksan Attessa, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the Roksans rear panel to obtain the lowest noise with the phono input. The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a very good 71dB in both channels, ref. 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 76dB, while an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 82.6dB. Spectral analysis of the phono inputs low-frequency noisefloor   revealed very low levels of random noise and power supply–related spuriae.Fig.21 Roksan Attessa, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, for 5mV input, measured at headphone output with volume control set to the maximum  .The phono inputs overload margins, measured at the headphone output and ref. 1kHz at 5mV, were superbly high at 20Hz and 1kHz, at 23.5dB. The margin dropped to a still-good 10.5dB at 20kHz. The phono inputs distortion signature was an equal mix of second and third harmonics, both lying at –106dB   with 1kHz at an input level of 20mV  . The level of the 1kHz difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones   was very low, at close to –80dB  , with the high-order intermodulation products even lower in level.Fig.22 Roksan Attessa, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 20mV input, measured at headphone output with volume control set to –20dB  .Fig.23 Roksan Attessa, MM phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz witht 100mV input  .With separates, it is possible for the designers to maximize resolution and minimize noise. With a single-box solution like the Roksan Attessa, it is difficult to do these things, with the current-heavy power supply in such close proximity to the low-level analog and digital decoding stages. However, the Attessas measured performance, especially that of the low-noise, low-distortion phono input, indicates that the inevitable compromises have been managed well.           ',\n",
       " '  Simaudio Moon Neo 340i    . I looked first at the behavior of the optional digital-input board, using either S/PDIF data sourced from the Audio Precision via optical or coaxial links, or USB data from my Mac Book Pro running on battery power. To avoid overloading the power-amplifier section, I switched the loudspeakers off and looked at the signals at the fixed line-output jacks. The TosLink input locked to data with sample rates up to 96kHz, the coaxial inputs to data sampled at all rates up to 192kHz. Apples AudioMIDI app revealed that the Neo 340i operated with 32-bit integer data at all sample rates from 32 to 384kHz. The USB Prober utility identified the Simaudio as the \"MOON USB DSD HD Audio\" from \"Simaudio Ltd.,\" and confirmed that its USB input operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode.The digital input preserved absolute polarity   at both the line and speaker outputs. A 1kHz tone at 0dBFS gave rise to a level of 1.89V at the line output, though with the volume control set to its maximum, digital data at –12dBFS resulted in a level just below clipping. The impulse response with 44.1kHz data   revealed that the Neo 340is reconstruction filter was a conventional FIR type with a sharp rolloff above 20kHz with 44.1kHz data  . The aliasing product of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz at 25kHz   is suppressed by 85dB, and the harmonics of the fundamental tone are all very low in level.Fig.1 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, S/PDIF input, impulse response, 44.1kHz data.Fig.2 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, S/PDIF input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.3 shows the digital modules frequency response with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz. There is a slight imbalance between the channels, but the responses follow the same basic shape, with a sharp rolloff just below half of each sample rate. With 384kHz data, the response followed the same shape as the 192kHz traces, but with extended output above 96kHz, reaching –10dB at 160kHz. Channel separation via the digital inputs was excellent, at 105dB below 1kHz and still 85dB at the top of the audio band. Noise levels were also low for digital input signals, so that increasing the bit depth from 16 to 24 with dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS dropped the noise floor by almost 20dB  , implying resolution of at least 19 bits. Some low-level, supply-related spuriae are visible in this graph, but overall the noise floor is sufficiently low that the Simaudios reproduction of an undithered 16-bit sinewave at exactly –90.31dBFS was essentially perfect  . With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a well-formed sinewave  .Fig.3 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, S/PDIF input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.4 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, S/PDIF input, 44.1kHz data, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.5 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, S/PDIF input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.6 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, S/PDIF input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .As implied by the blue and cyan traces in  .2, the Simaudios digital module produced very low levels of harmonic distortion, with the third harmonic the highest in level, at just –106dB  . Intermodulation distortion was similarly low, and the digital module offered superb rejection of word-clock jitter via both its TosLink   and USB inputs  .Fig.7 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, S/PDIF input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 0dBFS  .Fig.8 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, S/PDIF input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data  .

Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.The optional phono stage offered 39.65dB of gain measured at the fixed line-output jacks when set to MM  , 57.65dB of gain when set to MC  . With the volume control set to its maximum and the phono stage set to MC, a 1kHz tone at 1mV resulted in a level of 4.56V at the speaker outputs; ie, a total gain of 73.2dB. The phono module preserved absolute polarity in both MM and MC modes, and the input impedance at 1kHz was 46k ohms at 1kHz when set to \"47k,\" or 101 ohms when set to \"100.\" The input impedance at the frequency extremes was not appreciably different from that at 1kHz.  The RIAA error was very small  , though the right channel was very slightly higher in level than the left. Both channels featured a low-frequency response that was down by 3dB at 20Hz. Channel separation via the phono inputs was good, at >60dB, and the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratios were also good, at 78dB   and 61dB  , both measured with the input shorted. The A-weighted ratios were even better, at a respective 86.5 and 75.3dB.  Fig.10 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .At normal levels, the 340is phono module offered very low levels of harmonic distortion   and intermodulation distortion  . However, while the overload margins were very high at low and middle frequencies, at at least 25dB   and 29dB  , these dropped at 20kHz to just 7dB   and 11dB  .  Fig.11 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1V into 100k ohms  .Fig.12 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1V peak into 100k ohms  .The amplifier as a whole offered a moderate 35.2dB of gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms for both its balanced and unbalanced line-level inputs, and both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity. While the balanced input impedance was high, at 44k ohms at all audio frequencies, the unbalanced input impedance was relatively low, at 7200 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to just 5200 ohms at 20kHz.   As a result, a tubed source with a high output impedance at low frequencies might sound a little lean.The output impedance at the line-output jacks was a low 100 ohms at all audio frequencies. Measured at the speaker outputs, it was a very low 0.05 ohm at low and middle frequencies  , rising inconsequentially to 0.08 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the modulation of the Neo 340is frequency response by the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.09dB  . The output was down by 3dB at a high 90kHz, meaning that a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with short risetimes  , and there was no overshoot or ringing. The 340is frequency response was the same at all volume-control settings and for both balanced and unbalanced inputs.Fig.13 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, unbalanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.14 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation for the line-level inputs was an even 74dB R–L, but lower at high frequencies in the other direction. The unweighted, wideband S/N ratio, measured with the inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, was a modest 71.2dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms, improving to 87.4dB when the measurement bandwidth was limited to the audioband, and to 90.2dB when A-weighted. These  ures were for the left channel; the right channels ratios were all 2–3dB smaller, due to there being a higher level of spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics in that channel  . These ratios and graph were taken with an unbalanced input; with a balanced input, these spuriae were all up to 12dB higher in level, which I suspect is due to the fact that these inputs are carried on a small board connected to the main board with flying leads.Fig.15 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, unbalanced input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Neo 340is maximum power is specified as 100Wpc into 8 ohms   or 200W into 4 ohms  . Figs. 16 and 17 reveal that, with both channels driven, the amplifier clipped at 130Wpc into 8 ohms   and 200Wpc into 4 ohms, with low levels of distortion at output powers of a few tens of watts. To be sure I was looking at true distortion, I tested   how the THD+noise percentage changed with frequency at 12.7V  . Other than into 2 ohms  , there was only a slight rise in THD toward the top of the audioband, and very little increase into lower impedances.Fig.16 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.17 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.18 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.7V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The distortion signature was predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  , though there was also some second harmonic about 12dB lower in level when the output power was 3dB below clipping into 4 ohms  , as well as some lower-level, higher-order harmonics and some supply-related spuriae. When   340i with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level a few dB below visual clipping on an oscilloscope, the second-order intermodulation product at 1kHz lay at just –96dB  , though the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz lay at –74dB  .Fig.19 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.042% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.20 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.21 Simaudio Moon Neo 340i, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .Finally, looking at the headphone output, this offered the same maximum gain as the speaker outputs and was non-inverting. However, as its source impedance was a high 300 ohms, the headphone output should be regarded as utilitarian.Overall, Simaudios Moon Neo 340i offers excellent measured performance; I was particularly impressed by its affordably priced phono and digital modules. One point should be noted, however: The 340is heatsinking isnt adequate for sustained use at high powers. Before the testing, when   amplifier by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms with both channels driven—the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -A/B output stage—its side-mounted heatsinks became too hot to touch after 30 minutes, measuring 160.6°F  . Even the top panel was hot, at 111.6°F  . This amplifier needs to be used in a well-ventilated location.           ',\n",
       " 'I measured Bel Canto Designs Black ACI 600    . Usually, before I test an amplifier, I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour, but this is relevant only for an amplifier with a conventional output stage. As the ACI 600 uses class-D output modules, I began testing it soon after turning it on. However, as class-D amplifiers produce RF noise that could drive my analyzers input circuitry into slew-rate limiting, I inserted, between the test load and the analyzer, Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz. Fort some tests, I also used the SYS2700s internal brickwall filter set to 20kHz, to ensure that my measurements were not being contaminated with noise above the audioband.Looking first at the single-ended analog line inputs, the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms, with the volume control set to the default maximum of \"85,\" measured a low 19.1dB. There might be insufficient gain with low-output sources, but selecting a maximum volume of \"100\" with the onscreen menu increased the gain to 34.1dB. The Soft mute setting reduced the level by 10dB; the Mute was, of course, a full mute. It should be noted that with high-output sources, the analog inputs clipped at 2.375V. These inputs inverted absolute polarity, and the input impedance was a relatively low 11k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. I had some problems measuring the output at the rear-panel headphone jack, as I could get output only in the left channel. However, the headphone output impedance was low, at 21 ohms at all audio frequencies, and the output preserved absolute polarity  .The output impedance at the speaker terminals was 0.2 ohm at all audio frequencies; as a result, the modulation of the ACI 600s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.2dB  . The response is down by 1.5dB at 20kHz, and above that frequency it drops off rapidly into all impedances. There is also a slight channel imbalance, of 0.2dB.   Without the auxiliary Audio Precision low-pass filter, the waveform of a 10kHz squarewave   was obscured by HF noise.   With the AP filter  , the waveforms risetimes were increased by the ultrasonic rolloff seen in  .1, and there is critically damped ringing on the leading edges, presumably due to the class-D modules output filter. The Bass EQ control   shelved up or down the output below 120Hz by as much as 3dB, and the Tilt control hinged the response above and below 800Hz by up to the same 3dB  .Fig.1 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms, no AP low-pass filter.Fig.3 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with AP low-pass filter.Fig.4 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, response of Bass EQ Control set to \"0\" and \"±3\"  .Fig.5 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, response of Tilt Control set to \"0\" and \"±5\"  .Channel separation was 100dB or greater below 1kHz, and still 70dB at the top of the audioband. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio—taken with the AP auxiliary filter, the input shorted to ground, and the volume control set to \"85\"—was 68.5dB, this improving to a respectable 83dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 85.5dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor   indicated the presence of a 60Hz component at –95dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms, and that all other AC-supply harmonics lay below –100dB.Fig.6 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 7 and 8 show how the Black ACI 600s percentage of THD+noise varied with output power into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. Actual distortion began to emerge from the noise floor at around 20W into both loads, but remained low in absolute terms until waveform clipping occurred. The Bel Canto is specified as offering 300Wpc into 8 ohms or 600Wpc into 4 ohms  , but these graphs shows that while the ACI 600 with both channels driven exceeded its specified 8-ohm clipping power, at 320W   it missed its 4-ohm power spec by just 0.2dB, delivering 515W at 1% THD+N.Fig.7 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.8 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I measured how the ACI 600s THD+N varied with frequency at a level, 20V, where I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise  . The THD was very low below 5kHz in both channels into 8 ohms  , but increased into 4 ohms, more in the right channel   than the left  . The THD was higher into 2 ohms  . The distortion itself comprised the relatively innocuous third harmonic  , with some second harmonic also present  . Intermodulation distortion was relatively low in level  .Fig.9 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.10 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.027% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .The ACI 600s phono input offers four different gains and a range of load impedances, all selectable with the onscreen menu. The gain, measured at the speaker terminals with the volume control set to \"85,\" ranged from 60.4dB   to 86.4dB  . The RIAA error was vanishingly small  , though the highs and lows rolled off, respectively reaching –3dB at 35kHz and at 17Hz. Noise levels were low, and with the lowest gain setting, the unweighted, wideband S/N ratio was an okay 58dB, this improving to 71dB when A-weighted. The S/N ratio decreased as the gain was increased. Phono overload margins were good, at 15dB at 20Hz, 12dB at 1kHz, and 11dB at 20kHz. Harmonic and intermodulation distortion levels via the phono input were also respectably low  .Fig.13 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, phono input, RIAA error at 1mV input  .Turning to the Black ACI 600s behavior with digital data, I tested it using the Audio Precisions TosLink and coaxial S/PDIF and AES/EBU inputs, and repeated the tests with WAV and AIFF files sourced from Pure Music 3.0 running on my MacBook Pro via the ACI 600s USB-B input. Both S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with sample rates of up to 96kHz, the AES/EBU input up to 192kHz. The USB-B input accepted 16- and 24-bit integer data sampled up to 384kHz. However, while the front-panel display did show \"384\" with data sampled at that rate, the ACI 600s output remained muted. Apples USB Prober utility identified the ACI 600 as \"BELCANTO Hi-Res 2\" from \"XMOS,\" and that it operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode.With the ACI 600s volume control set to \"85,\" a 1kHz tone at 0dBFS gave rise to an output of 21.26V from the speaker outputs, the latter equivalent to 56.5W into 8 ohms. Full-scale digital data didnt allow the amplifier to reach its full output, therefore; if the ACI 600 wont drive its owners speakers to high enough levels with its default maximum volume-control setting of \"85,\" the optional setting of \"100\" will add another 15dB.The Bel Cantos impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a minimum-phase type, with all the ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS, but also that the digital inputs are inverted. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the ACI 600s response rolled off slowly above the Nyquist frequency, or half the sample rate  . An alias at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   is therefore attenuated by just 20dB. The ACI 600s reconstruction filter appears to be identical to the standard MQA filter in both the time and frequency domains, and Bel Cantos John Stronczer confirmed via e-mail that they use this filter not only with MQA but with all PCM data, because he feels it sounds best for all sources.Fig.14 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.15 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.16 shows the ACI 600s digital frequency response with AES/EBU data sampled at 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , and 192kHz  . The response follows the same basic shape at all three sample rates, with a sharp rolloff just below each of the two lower Nyquist frequencies. With high-sample-rate data the digital response was dominated by the amplifiers ultrasonic rolloff. When the ACI 600 decoded dithered 16- and 24-bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, with the volume control set to \"85\" to minimize the effect of its selfnoise, the increase in bit depth dropped the noise floor by around 15dB  , which implies resolution of close to between 18 and 19 bits. With an undithered 16-bit tone at exactly–90.31dBFS   the waveform was symmetrical, but the three DC voltage levels described by the data are overlaid by some high-frequency noise. With undithered 24-bit data   the result was a fairly clean sinewave.Fig.16 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.17 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.18 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit TosLink data  .Fig.19 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit TosLink data  .  ACI 600s intermodulation distortion via its digital inputs with a signal comprising equal levels of 19 and 20kHz tones peaking at –3dBFS   rather than my usual 0dBFS. This is because the MQA filter overloads with top-octave data above that level; in his e-mail, Stronczer explained that this was acceptable because real music, as opposed to test tones, never has high-level energy that high in frequency. The leaky nature of the filter allows aliased images of the tones to appear, but actual intermodulation distortion is very low in level. With 16-bit J-Test data  , all of the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave are reproduced at the correct levels  . However, a low-level pair of sidebands can be seen at ±120Hz.Fig.20 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, digital input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at –3dBFS, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.21 Bel Canto Black ACI 600, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Bel Cantos Black ACI 600 packs high power and a lot of functionality into a small, elegant enclosure. Other than the problems I found with the headphone output and the inability to play data sampled at 384kHz via the USB-B input, both of which may be sample faults, it offers respectable measured performance.

       " '  Mark Levinson No.536 monoblocks      .   of a power amplifier, I precondition it by running it at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes.   After an hour driving 133W into 8 ohms, the temperature of the No.536s heatsinks was fairly hot, at 114.8°F  , and its top panel was warm, at 101.3°F  .The voltage gain into 8 ohms for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs was 25.6dB, and both inputs preserved absolute polarity, the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was extremely high, at 240k ohms 360k ohms balanced, and though at the top of the audioband this impedance dropped to 250k ohms balanced, these are still very high.The output impedance was low, at 0.1 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.13 ohm at 20kHz. The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by just ±0.1dB  . The amplifier offered a wide small-signal bandwidth, the output into 8 ohms   not reaching –3dB until 195kHz. Consequently, the No.536s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured very short risetimes and, commendably, no overshoot or ringing was apparent.Fig.1 Mark Levinson No.536, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Mark Levinson No.536, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Measured with the input shorted to ground, the Mark Levinson amplifier offered a wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio of 71dB, ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This improved to 96dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 99.3dB when the reading was A-weighted. This is a quiet amplifier, and while spectral analysis of its noise floor as it reproduced a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms   revealed some supply-related spuriae, these were all at a very low level.Fig.3 Mark Levinson No.536, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Mark Levinson is also an extremely powerful amplifier. With clipping defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%, the No.536 clipped at 510W into 8 ohms  , compared with the specified maximum output into 8 ohms of 400W  . It clipped at 800W into 4 ohms  , and at 1050W into 2 ohms  . I dont hold the wall voltage constant in these clipping tests, as I feel that is more representative of how an amplifier behaves in normal use. The wall voltage at the 20A circuit that feeds my test lab dropped from 122.8V to 119.5V with the No.536 clipping into 4 ohms, and to 117V with it clipping into 2 ohms. With the wall voltage held constant, the amplifier would deliver even more power into very low impedances! The shape of the traces in these two graphs puzzled me: Although the level of THD+N is extremely low at low powers, it starts to rise earlier than I expected, and the amplifier appears to become more linear at moderately high powers before it starts to clip. I suspect that this behavior is due to there being only a moderate degree of negative feedback.Fig.4 Mark Levinson No.536, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Mark Levinson No.536, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The THD+N percentage at 28.3V—which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms, 200W into 4 ohms, and 400W into 2 ohms—was very low at low and middle frequencies  . Though the THD rises at frequencies above 2kHz, it still lies below 0.08% at 20kHz. With a 1kHz signal, the distortion signature is odd-order in nature  , with the second harmonic around 12dB lower in level than the third  . At low frequencies, however, the higher-order harmonics reach the same level as the third, and the even-order products disappear  . However, it is fair to note that all the distortion components lie at or below –86dB  . And while the mix of harmonics varies with frequency, it remains constant with output power, which some commentators feel correlates with good sound quality. When   No.536 with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, the peak level equivalent to 200W into 4 ohms  , while some higher-order intermodulation products are visible, almost all lie below –90dB  , and the second-order difference product is at –100dB  .Fig.6 Mark Levinson No.536, THD+N   vs frequency at 28.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Mark Levinson No.536, 1kHz waveform at 200W into 8 ohms, 0.013% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Mark Levinson No.536, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Mark Levinson No.536, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Mark Levinson No.536, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Overall, the Mark Levinson No.536 measured very well, its performance uncompromised by its ability to deliver very high powers into low-impedance loads.

       " 'Because, in its flight case, each Moon by Simaudio 888 amplifier weighs 300 lb, I drove my   system  , with its host PC, monitor, test loads, and cables, to Mikeys place, rather than try to get one to my place and down the stairs from the front door to my basement test lab. We manhandled one 888 onto a dolly and wheeled it into Mikeys garage, where I set up my gear. Because the outlets in his garage werent up to the amplifiers current demands, we ran a long, heavy-duty extension cord to one of the 20A outlets in his house.Usually, before performing any measurements, I precondition an amplifier by running it for an hour at one-third its measured maximum power into 8 ohms—thermally, the worst case for an amplifier with a class-AB output stage. Time constraints—I needed to hit the road for the 45-mile drive home before the Friday-evening rush hour—meant that I had to cut the preconditioning period to 20 minutes. By the end of that time, the Moon 888s top panel was barely warm, at 78.4°F  ; the side-mounted heatsinks were hotter, at 109.6°F  .The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms using the balanced input was slightly higher than the specified 31dB, at 32dB. For the unbalanced input the gain was 29dB, 3dB lower than the balanced gain rather than the expected 6dB. The amplifier was non-inverting   with both inputs. Its balanced input impedance was 32k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to the specified 24k ohms at 20kHz. The unbalanced input impedance was 16k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, but 10k ohms at 20kHz.The Moon 888s output impedance, including 6 of speaker cable, was very low, at 0.03 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.085 ohm at 20kHz. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore minimal  . Into an 8 ohm resistive load  , the Simaudios response was flat almost up to 20kHz, then rolled off to reach –3dB at 70kHz rather than the specified 200kHz. The response rolled off a little earlier into lower impedances.Fig.1 Moon 888, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .A rear-panel switch allows the amplifier to be operated with DC or AC input coupling. The DC response was flat down to 10Hz  ; the AC response began to roll off in the low bass, reaching –1dB around 15Hz  . The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms was commendably free from overshoot and ringing  .Fig.2 Moon 888, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with: DC selected  , AC selected    .Fig.3 Moon 888, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Moon 888s unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted to ground, was 75.2dB. This improved to an excellent 87.3dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 89.8dB when the measurement was A-weighted. Spuriae were present in the amplifiers noise floor at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its odd harmonic, but these all lay at or below –106dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.4 Moon 888, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .As its name suggests, the Moon 888 is specified as delivering a staggering 888W into 8 ohms  . Using our definition of clipping—ie, when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%—the amplifier exceeded that output, clipping with a 1kHz signal at 990W into 8 ohms  . The clipping power didnt double when the load was halved, 1300W being delivered at clipping into 4 ohms  , but its fair to note that I didnt hold the wall voltage constant for this test. However, the Moon 888 turned itself off several times during these high-power tests, particularly when I tried   to measure the clipping power into 2 ohms.Fig.5 Moon 888, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Moon 888, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+N changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was extremely low in the midrange into 8 and 4 ohms  , but rose into 2 ohms  . In this test I sweep a tone from 20kHz down to 20Hz, and you can see that the 2 ohm trace cuts off at 80Hz, which was when the amplifiers protection kicked in  . This behavior was reminiscent of what happened when   Bricasti Design M15 amplifier, reviewed in the July issue. I also noticed that when I turned the Moon 888 off and on after one of these incidents, the percentage of THD+N was at first about twice as high as in  .7; it then took about a minute to drop to the previously measured value.Fig.7 Moon 888, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the Moon 888s distortion was predominantly the subjectively innocuous third harmonic  , and lay at a low –80dB  , though the fifth and seventh harmonics rose to the level of the third harmonic at high powers into 4 ohms  . Though some higher-order intermodulation products were evident when the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at high power into 4 ohms  , these all lay below –80dB, and the second-order difference product at 1kHz was vanishingly low in level, at –117dB  .Fig.8 Moon 888, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.0065% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Moon 888, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Moon 888, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Overall, this is good measured performance. I suspect that the Moon by Simaudio 888s aggressive protection circuitry is due to the significant amount of energy that can be stored in an amplifier that can deliver more than a kilowatt into low impedances. Footnote 1: I was using the Moon 888s when   spatially averaged frequency responses of the EgglestonWorks Viginti speakers that Michael reviewed in June, and one of the amplifiers went into protection a couple of times then.

       " 'As can be seen from  .1, the Rowland exhibits a virtually ruler-flat frequency-response curve. The 10kHz squarewave   indicates a fast rise-time, with no significant rounding of the leading edges. Polarity of the Rowland was non-inverting, and input impedance at 1kHz was 20.8k ohms, 95k ohms, and 750 ohms at the 20k ohm, 100k ohm, and 600 ohm input settings respectively. It required 142.4mV to give an output of 1W into 8 ohms, a gain of 26dB. Unweighted noise was 75.3dB below 1W into 8 ohms. Channel separation was better than 105dB below 1.5kHz  , decreasing linearly to 92dB at 20kHz.Fig.1 Rowland Model 1, frequency response at 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.2 Rowland Model 1, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The output impedance of the Model 1 was uniformly low, ranging from 0.056 to 0.065 ohms across the audible range. Distortion at low power is shown in  .3, which plots THD+noise against frequency at 2.83V into 8, 4, and 2 ohms  . The consistently low distortion increases as the impedance drops—not unexpectedly. What is interesting is the slight reduction in distortion into both 4 and 2 ohms at higher frequencies, which is unusual, suggesting perhaps that the amplifiers VHF bandwidth narrows a little with increasing output current. The waveform of the distortion in  .4   indicates a predominantly third-harmonic characteristic overlaid with noise. The equivalent waveform for a 1kHz, 1W output into 8 ohms   was dominated by noise.Fig.3 Rowland Model 1, THD+noise vs frequency at  : 4W into 2 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, 1W into 8 ohms.Fig.4 Rowland Model 1, 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.5 shows the spectrum from a 50Hz sinewave driven at 80W into 4 ohms. The second harmonic is negligible; the third harmonic is stronger   but still down 75.8dB. Fig.6 shows the high-frequency IM spectrum with 19 and 20kHz tones driven at 80W into 4 ohms. The 1kHz product is down 83.5dB; well under 0.001%. A similar measurement for 40W into 8 ohms is not shown since it was, if anything, slightly better at –85.3dB.  Fig.5 Rowland Model 1, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC-1kHz, at 67W into 4 ohms  .Fig.6 Rowland Model 1, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-22kHz, 19+20kHz at 48V peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.7 indicates the THD vs power for 8, 4, and 2 ohms at 1kHz, one channel driven  . The maximum output power at 1% THD was 84W   into 8 ohms, 140W   into 4 ohms, and 220W   into 2 ohms. These  ures all lie well above the \"knee\" of the distortion curve. I consider the \"knee\" of this curve, when well defined and followed by a rapidly increasing distortion above it, to indicate the highest practical useful power output of an amplifier. In the case of the Model 1, the knee falls at 67W  , 130W  , and 215W  . In the latter two cases, I choose as the knee the break-point before the steepest slope of the distortion curve.Fig.7 Rowland Model 1, distortion   vs output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, and 2 ohms.With both channels driven, the Model 1s output power was 76W   into 8 ohms and 126.8   into 4 ohms  . The power-supply fuses blew   at 190W into 2 ohms, before clipping could be reached.DC offset in the Rowland was 2mV in the left channel, 3mV in the right. It operated quite warm to the touch following its 1-hour, 1/3-power preconditioning, but not hot.Finally, I measured both the frequency response and the low-power THD+noise vs frequency for the Rowland set for a 600 ohm load. Except for the input impedance measurements, where all three settings were checked, the above measurements were made into the amplifiers 20k ohm setting. The curves have not been shown because they did not differ at all from the equivalent curves for the 20k ohm setting.Attempting to relate the outstanding lab-test results of the Rowland Model 1 to its equally rewarding sound was a hopeless task. However, the measurements in this case merely indicated that this is, from any objective measure, a solidly designed amplifier.—Thomas J. Norton          ',\n",
       " 'When I received the sample of the Moonriver 404 Reference that Jason Victor Serinus had auditioned, serial number DK201002153RE, it rattled when I unpacked it. I removed the top cover and saw that the amplifier had incurred damage during its transcontinental journey. The heavy toroidal power transformer is mounted on one side of the large printed circuit board that occupies almost all the amplifiers internal space, with two aluminum straps connecting the board to the central internal heatsink to provide the necessary support. The box must have been dropped on its top during the journey, as the two aluminum straps had fractured, with one loose inside the chassis. When I connected the amplifier to my   system  , the left channel was dead, though I was able to perform a complete set of tests on the right channel using the line-level inputs.I let Editor Jim Austin and Moonrivers US distributor, Philip OHanlon of On a Higher Note, know about the situation. OHanlon told me that there would be a running change in production to provide more support for the transformer, and he arranged for Moonriver to ship a second sample to me directly from Sweden.This sample, serial number DK201120164RE, arrived without shipping damage, and I resumed testing. Although the internal heatsink doesnt look substantial, it is connected to the bottom panel with thermally conductive grease so that the entire chassis can dissipate heat.   amplifier by following the IHFs recommendation of operating it at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time, the temperature of the chassis was 100.1°F  . The 404 Reference has sufficient heatsink capacity for its rated power.I looked first at the new samples behavior via its line inputs. The maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 46dB, which is a little higher than usual for an integrated amplifier. At the preamplifier output, the maximum gain measured 16dB. The 404 Reference preserved absolute polarity   at both its loudspeaker and preamplifier outputs.The 404 References line input impedance was an appropriately high 24k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to a sufficiently high 17.1k ohms at 20kHz. The manual says that the preamplifier output impedance is \"a few ohms.\" I measured 96 ohms at high and middle frequencies and a higher 1426 ohms at the bottom of the audioband. However, I had problems measuring the behavior of the 404 References preamplifier output due to the presence of high levels of ultrasonic noise  . I believe this noise, which had a center frequency around 1.7MHz, was confusing the input of the  . This noise was present with both samples of the amplifier, and could be the cause of a \"buzz\" Jason Serinus told me he experienced with the preamplifier output.The amplifiers output impedance was moderately low, at 0.23 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.33 ohms at 20kHz. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore small, at ±0.25dB  . This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum, and the right channel output   was 0.25dB higher than the left  . The channel balance improved at lower settings of the volume control, in the range at which it will most often be used. The amplifier rolls off slightly at the top of the audioband, the response reaching –0.4dB at 20kHz and –3dB at 50kHz. This results in a slight lengthening of the waveforms leading edges with the Moonrivers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . The waveform is free from overshoot and ringing, however.Fig.1 Moonriver 404 Reference, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.02 Moonriver 404 Reference, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation via the line inputs   was okay, at 72dB in both directions below 2kHz, decreasing to 48dB, L–R, and 56dB, R–L, at 20kHz. The level of the Moonrivers noise floor dropped at lower settings of the volume control, but even with the control at its maximum, which is the setting I use for noise-floor analysis, supply-related spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics remained at or below –90dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  . The higher-order supply harmonics were around 10dB lower in level in the right channel   than the left  . The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, taken with the input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was 54.7dB, left, and 49.9dB, right, ref. 2.83V output into 8 ohms. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audible range improved the ratios to 75.3dB and 74.8dB, respectively, while switching an A-weighting filter into circuit improved the ratio in both channels to 77.8dB.Fig.3 Moonriver 404 Reference, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum   and \"–12.0\"  .Fig.4 plots the percentage of THD+noise in the 404 References speaker output vs power into 8 ohms. Though the 404 References maximum power is specified as 50W into 8 ohms  , using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%,  .4 indicates that the amplifier clipped at 39.5Wpc into 8 ohms  . The Moonriver clipped at 60W into 4 ohms  .  Fig.4 Moonriver 404 Reference, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Moonriver 404 Reference, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I measured how the 404 References distortion changed with frequency at 12.67V output, which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms and 40W into 4 ohms. The THD+N percentage was low in the midrange and bass into both loads   but rose in the top audio octaves, more in the right channel   than the left  . The distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic   with the third and higher harmonics lower in level, even into 4 ohms  . Even with the rise in distortion at the top of the audioband, intermodulation distortion was low  , the difference product at 1kHz resulting from equal-level tones at 19kHz and 20kHz at high power into 4 ohms lying just below –80dB  .Fig.6 Moonriver 404 Reference, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.67V into: 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Moonriver 404 Reference, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.02% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Moonriver 404 Reference, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 40W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Moonriver 404 Reference, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms  .The first sample included the optional USB digital module. I didnt test this, however, as it uses an AKM DAC chip that is no longer available due to a disastrous fire at the Japanese factory in late October 2020.   The digital module wasnt installed in the second sample of the amplifier. The 404 References phono input offers moving magnet and moving coil modes, these selectable with internal DIP switches; however, the second sample of the 404 Reference had not been fitted with the phono module: This input behaved identically to the line inputs.The Moonriver 404 References measured performance had some good points: the low level of power-supply spuriae and the distortion signature, which is primarily the subjectively benign second harmonic without this being accompanied by excessive levels of intermodulation distortion. However, the amplifier does not meet its specified powers. I was also bothered by the high level of ultrasonic noise from the preamplifier outputs. Footnote 1: The level of this noise was not reduced when I floated the Audio Precisions signal generator ground nor when I connected the grounding terminal on the amplifiers rear panel to the analyzer ground.

The Amp-60 has no heatsinks per se; instead, its massive aluminum chassis dissipates heat.  , I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone for an hour at one-third power into 8 ohms, which is the most thermally stressful condition for an amplifier with a class-AB output stage. At the end of that time, the Veritys top panel was relatively cool at 79.3°F  ; its side panels were only a little warmer, at 92.1°F  .The voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 31.7dB for both balanced and unbalanced signals, which is almost 5dB higher than the norm. Both sets of inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLR jacks being wired with pin 2 hot. The unbalanced input impedance was on the low side, at 9.1k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 8.6k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 20k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz.The output impedance, including a 6-long, spaced-pair speaker cable, was a moderate 0.18 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.25 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was ±0.2dB  . The Monsalvats frequency response into 8 ohms was down by just 0.3dB at 100kHz  ; as a result, a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with very short risetimes  , with just a slight hint of overshoot. A 1kHz squarewave was perfectly square  . Fig.1 reveals that the ultrasonic output rolls off earlier with lower impedances, with the response into 2 ohms   down by 0.9dB at 20kHz. Channel separation, measured using the balanced input, was >70dB in both directions in the midrange and below, decreasing to 62dB at the top of the audioband.Fig.1 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The signal/noise ratios, taken with the inputs shorted to ground and ref. 1W into 8 ohms, were different for balanced and unbalanced operation. The unbalanced, unweighted, wideband ratio was an extremely high 91.5dB in the left channel and 88.3dB in the right. These ratios respectively improved to a superb 102.1 and 101.1dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit. The balanced ratios, however, were all lower, the A-weighted  ures being 78.6dB for the left channel, 82.8dB for the right.Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor with unbalanced drive   indicated that there were AC power-supply–related harmonics at 60Hz and both its odd-order harmonics   and its even-order harmonics  . Other than the spectral component at 60Hz, which was at a still-very-low –94dB  , these spuriae all lay at or below –107dB  , and the random noise-floor components were all extremely low. However, when I repeated the analysis with the balanced inputs, all of the supply-related harmonics rose by around 20dB, which is why the balanced S/N ratios werent as good as the unbalanced ratios. This is unusual—balanced operation tends to have lower noise, due to the circuits common-mode noise rejection.Fig.3 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, unbalanced drive, spectrum, DC–1kHz, ref. 1W into 8 ohms  .The Monsalvat Amp-60s output is specified as 60Wpc into 8 ohms and 120Wpc into 4 ohms  , and 180Wpc into 2 ohms  . Our review sample exceeded these specifications into 8 and 4 ohms. With clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the output reaches 1% and with both of the Amp-60s channels driven, I measured clipping powers of 95Wpc into 8 ohms   and 145Wpc into 4 ohms  . I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests; it measured 119.8V AC at the measured clipping power. However, when I tried to measure the maximum output power into 2 ohms with only the left channel driven, the Amp-60 clipped at just 50W  . I repeated the test, this time with only the right channel driven, and got the same result.Fig.4 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.I examined how the Verity amplifiers percentage of THD+N varied with frequency at 10V, which is equivalent to 12.5W into 8 ohms and 25W into 4 ohms. The percentage of THD+N was low in the bass and midrange  , with the right channel   more linear than the left  . While there was the usual rise in the treble due to the decrease in open-loop voltage gain as the frequency increased, this was by only a small amount.Fig.7 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, THD+N   vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The left channels THD+N waveform at 30Wpc into 8 ohms   indicates that the distortion was low, at 0.013%, and had strong second-harmonic content, though with spuriae also occurring at the zero crossing points. With a low-frequency tone at 50Wpc into 8 ohms, the second harmonic was indeed the highest in level in the left channel, at –78dB  . The second harmonic was lower in the right channel, at –87dB  , and the third harmonic is now the highest in level, at –80dB  . There are some higher-order harmonics present, as well as supply-related spuriae, but these all lie below –100dB  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones, the Amp-60 produced relatively low levels of intermodulation distortion, even at high powers into low impedances  . The difference product at 1kHz lay at –77dB in the left channel   and at –90dB in the right  . The higher-order products were all at or below –80dB  .Fig.8 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, 1kHz waveform at 30W into 8 ohms, 0.013% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Verity Monsalvat Amp-60, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 4 ohms  .The Verity Monsalvat Amp-60s measured performance is generally respectable. However, I was bothered by the difference in S/N ratios between the balanced and single-ended inputs, and by the shortfall in measured power into 2 ohms.           ',\n",
       " '  B.M.C. Amplifier C1, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . Before testing the B.M.C., I ran both channels at 1/3 the rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes, which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-A/B output stage. At the end of that time the C1s chassis was too hot to touch, at 145°F  , but the amplifier was otherwise operating correctly.The volume control operated in 66 accurate 1dB steps, with the unity gain setting an indicated \"39\" for balanced inputs, \"33\" for unbalanced. The voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms using the balanced XLR inputs was lower than usual for an integrated amplifier, at 27.16dB. Unusually, the gain using the unbalanced RCA jacks was 6dB higher. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the input XLR jacks wired with pin 2 hot. The unbalanced input impedance was 30k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to 28k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was more than twice this value, at 89k ohms.The output impedance, including 6 of speaker cables, was low at <0.1 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.13 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the modulation of the Amp C1s frequency response, due to the Ohms Law interaction between this output impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was just ±0.1dB  . This graph shows that the amplifiers response was flat from 10Hz up to 20kHz into 4 and 8 ohms, but started to roll off above the audioband into 2 ohms  , reaching –0.25dB at 20kHz. The C1s wide bandwidth into higher impedances results in a well-defined 10kHz squarewave  . Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to unity gain. As Carlos Candeias admitted to Mikey, there is some restriction of the amplifiers bandwidth when the volume control was set at or close to its maximum. The red and blue traces in  .3 were taken with the control at \"66\"—the response is down by 1.8dB at 10Hz and 3.6dB at 20kHz. Reducing the setting to \"60\" brought up the level at 20kHz by 2.5dB  , but the response wasnt flat within the audioband until the volume was reduced another 6dB, to \"54\"  . But as Carlos Candeias said, this will not be an issue with practical sources, such as CD players, which will require lower settings of the volume control.Fig.1 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with volume control set to: \"66\"  , \"60\"  , \"54\"    .The B.M.C.s channel separation was superb, at 110dB in both directions below 2kHz, and a still-excellent 90dB at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, taken with the input short-circuited and the volume control set to its maximum—very much a worst-case situation—was good rather than great at 72.1dB in the left channel and 74.1dB in the right, both referenced to 1W into 8 ohms. A-weighting improved these ratios to 76.7 and 78.7dB, respectively. And, as can be seen in  .4, there are also some low-level hum components at the odd-order harmonics of the AC supply, in addition to the usual random noise. These components are presumably due to magnetic interference from the massive toroidal transformer that dominates the amplifiers interior.Fig.4 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .The Amp C1s front-panel power meters appeared to be correctly calibrated into 4 ohms. Fig.5 plots the THD+noise percentage in the C1s output against power into 8 ohms. Actual distortion starts to rise out of the noise floor above 4W or so, when the THD+N is just 0.011%. With actual waveform clipping defined as the point where the THD+N reaches 1%, the C1 slightly exceeds, at 180Wpc  , its power specification of 175Wpc. Into 4 ohms, however, it falls short of the specified 330Wpc by just under 1dB, outputting 275Wpc into 4 ohms  . The Amp C1 did reach 330Wpc at 3% THD+N, however, and its fair to note that I dont hold the AC wall voltage constant for these tests. Fig.7 shows how the THD+N varied with output power into 2 ohms; the C1 was less comfortable with this load, clipping at just 240W  .Fig.5 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.This unhappiness with very low impedances can also be seen in  .8, which plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at a level, 12.65V, equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms, where I could be sure that the reading wasnt being dominated by noise. The Amp C1 offers low THD into 8 ohms at this level, with the left channel   being slightly more linear than the right  . This is reversed into 4 ohms, with a somewhat higher level of THD  . But with just the left channel driving 2 ohms  , the C1 offers more than 10 times the THD that it does into 8 ohms.Fig.8 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .At low powers into high impedances, the distortion is strongly third-harmonic in nature  , which will be subjectively benign. But as the output current increases, some sharply defined discontinuities appear in the waveform of the spuriae  , which indicates the presence of the more subjectively disturbing high-order harmonics  . Although  .8 indicates that the B.M.C.s linearity at high frequencies is not significantly worse than at lower frequencies, driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz into 8 ohms at a level a couple of dB below visible waveform clipping into 8 ohms gave rise to many high-order products  , even though the difference tone at 1kHz lies at a respectably low 86dB  . However, dropping the power by 5dB significantly reduced the amount of intermodulation distortion  .Fig.9 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms  , 0.021% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 4 ohms  , 0.0615% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 B.M.C. Amplifier C1, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 30W peak into 8 ohms  .The measured performance of B.M.C. Audios Amplifier C1 suggests that it offers a lot of power in a very attractive package for a relatively affordable price, but it really shouldnt be used with speakers that drop below 4 ohms; it is most comfortable with 8 ohm designs.

       " '  Simaudio Moon i3.3, I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system   .Before I did any testing of the Moon i3.3, I ran it at 33Wpc into 8 ohms for an hour. This power level   imposes the maximum heat stress on an amplifier with a class-AB output stage, and at the end of the hour, the Simaudios heatsinks were way too hot to touch and its top plate was around 140°F  . You should make sure that this amplifier is in a well-ventilated position. The THD+noise at this power level, with the amplifier stone cold, was 0.025%; after 60 minutes it had risen to 0.05%, but the amplifier seemed otherwise fine.Although Erick Lichte didnt use it, the review sample of the i3.3 was fitted with the optional phono stage  , a small daughterboard at the right rear of the chassis. Internal jumpers allow this to be set to MM or MC modes, for the input impedance to be set to 100 or 47k ohms, and for the input capacitance to be switched between 0 and 100pF. The phono-stage gain, measured at the fixed line-level output, was approximately 5.5dB higher than the specified  ures of 40 and 60dB  , but this appeared to be due to the fact that the level from this output for line-level signals was 5.7dB higher than unity. Both MM and MC settings preserved absolute polarity  , and the input impedances at 1kHz were close to specification, at 49k ohms   and 101 ohms  . These impedances varied only slightly at different frequencies.Fig.1 shows the departure of the RIAA equalization from true accuracy: The treble is shelved up by 0.4dB, and the right channel is 0.25dB higher in level than the left, but otherwise the channels match closely. The i3.3s phono board incorporates the IEC-recommended low-frequency rolloff, and the output rolls off sharply above 40kHz. The phono stage was pretty quiet for such an inexpensive option. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was excellent at 76.8dB   and 62dB  , measured at the fixed outputs with the input shorted and referenced to 1kHz at 5mV and 500µV, respectively. A-weighting the measurements gave 88.5 and 65dB. The overload margins were also excellent, at 29dB at 20Hz and 26dB at 1kHz in both modes. The 20kHz margin was less good, however, at approximately 7dB. Stephen Mejias will be writing a \"Follow-Up\" review on this phono stage.Fig.1 Simaudio Moon i3.3, phono input response with RIAA correction  .  Moving on to the amplifiers performance from its line inputs, these also preserved absolute polarity, and offered an unbalanced input impedance of the specified 11k ohms at low and midrange frequencies, this dropping to 7k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was twice these  ures, as expected. The output impedance from the variable preamp jacks was a low 100 ohms. Measured at the speaker jacks, the i3.3 preserved absolute polarity and offered a sensible maximum gain of 35.3dB into 8 ohms for both the regular unbalanced inputs and the optional balanced outputs.The output impedance was a very low 0.06 ohm over most of the audioband, rising to just 0.09 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the variation in frequency response with our simulated loudspeaker   was minimal. This graph also shows that the i3.3 has an extended high-frequency response, the –3dB point lying at 90kHz. Commendably, this was not affected by the volume-control setting, and the 10kHz squarewave response featured very low risetimes   and the 1kHz squarewave was beautifully square  .Fig.2 Simaudio Moon i3.3, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.3 Simaudio Moon i3.3, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.4 Simaudio Moon i3.3, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was good, at >80dB in both directions below 7kHz, and the wideband, unweighted S/N ratio   was a good 71dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms, improving to 75dB when A-weighted.The background noise limited the THD+N measurement at low power levels, but the true distortion began to emerge from the noise floor at around 10W into 8 ohms and 30W into 4 ohms  . This graph also shows that, even with both channels driven, the Simaudio comfortably exceeds its specified maximum power, the 1% THD+N limit being reached at 130Wpc into 8 ohms   and 210Wpc into 4 ohms  . I plotted the THD+N percentage against frequency at 9V  , and you can see in  .6 that while the distortion starts to rise in the top two octaves, particularly in the right channel, it remains low in absolute terms.Fig.5 Simaudio Moon i3.3, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4 ohms.Fig.6 Simaudio Moon i3.3, THD+N   vs frequency at 9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The distortion is strongly third-harmonic in nature  , which will be relatively benign in subjective terms. However, spectral analysis of the amplifiers output driving a high-power, low-frequency tone into 4 ohms   reveals that, as well as some other low-order spuriae accompanying the third harmonic, spectral components are present at the odd harmonics of the 60Hz AC mains frequency. I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision test set but couldnt eliminate the spuriae. Though there is some 120Hz content present, which is the frequency of the raw full-wave-rectified supply, this is low in level, at –109dB and –104dB, left and right channels, respectively. The presence of odd-order harmonics of the 60Hz frequency suggests that these result from magnetic interference from the humongous toroidal transformer that occupies half the amplifiers internal real estate. So, even though the amplifier performs well on the high-frequency intermodulation test, with low levels of low-order intermodulation products  , the noise floor is marred by the 60Hz harmonics. It is fair to point out, however, that these drop to below –120dB above 2.5kHz, even in the noisier right channel.Fig.7 Simaudio Moon i3.3, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 4 ohms  , 0.02% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Simaudio Moon i3.3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 60W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Simaudio Moon i3.3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 60W peak into 8 ohms  .Turning to the Moon i3.3s performance as a D/A converter, I measured its behavior at the fixed outputs with the volume control set to its minimum, to avoid stressing the power-amplifier section. The USB input uses the ubiquitous Burr-Brown PCM2705 receiver chip, which is limited to sample rates of 48kHz and below and to 16-bit data. The S/PDIF inputs successfully locked to data with sample rates ranging from 32 to 192kHz, though with the AP SYS2722s digital output, the i3.3s front-panel display stubbornly said \"44.1kHz\" regardless of the actual sample rate. It did display the correct sample rate with the digital output of the RME soundcard fitted to one of my lab PCs, however, and it appears that not all digital sources include the necessary metadata for the i3.3 to correctly display the sample rate. Simaudio will have a user-con urable firmware update for this by the time you read this review. In the meantime, it is important to note that the D/A board does correctly decode data regardless of the sample rate. This can be seen in  .10, which shows the frequency response with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz.Fig.10 Simaudio Moon i3.3, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz  .  With my usual test for DAC resolution, in which I sweep a 1/3-octave bandpass filter from 20kHz to 20Hz while the device under test decodes dithered data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, increasing the word length from 16 to 24 bits drops the noise floor by around 10dB  . This suggest that the i3.3s digital board, which uses the 24-bit PCM1793 DAC chip from Burr-Brown, actually achieves closer to 18-bit performance. This is not quite good enough to resolve a tone at –120dBFS  . The 60Hz-related spuriae can also be seen in this graph, as well as in FFT-derived spectra of the same –90dBFS data  .Fig.11 Simaudio Moon i3.3, 1/3-octave spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16-bit data   and 24-bit data  , and of dithered tone at –90dBFS with 24-bit data  .  Fig.12 Simaudio Moon i3.3, FFT-derived spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data  .The i3.3 made a fairly good attempt at correctly decoding undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS, which should consist of three DC voltage levels  . Increasing the bit depth gave a good, if rather noisy, representation of a sinewave  , and linearity error with 16-bit data was negligible down to below –105dBFS  . The Moons D/A circuitry featured low distortion, the only harmonics accompanying a full-scale tone being the second and third, both at –100dBFS  .Fig.13 Simaudio Moon i3.3, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.14 Simaudio Moon i3.3, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Fig.15 Simaudio Moon i3.3, left-channel linearity error, dBR vs dBFS, 16-bit data.Fig.16 Simaudio Moon i3.3, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave at 0dBFS into 100k ohms  .The i3.3s TosLink input showed fairly good rejection of interface jitter, with the Miller Analyzer measuring 575 picoseconds peak–peak. This primarily comprises data-related sidebands at ±229Hz  . Though the USB connection is not susceptible to interface jitter, performing a similar analysis with the same signal sourced from my MacBook revealed a rather messy-looking spectrum  , with sidebands present at 595ps p–p. The spectral peak representing the 11.025kHz tone is noticeably broadened at its base compared with  .17, due to the presence of low-frequency random timing errors.Fig.17 Simaudio Moon i3.3, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz, 16-bit data from PC via TosLink. Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz  .Fig.18 Simaudio Moon i3.3, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz, 16-bit data from MacBook via USB. Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz  .Simaudios Moon i3.3 offers usefully high power in an attractively small package, though its use of a larger-than-normal AC transformer does somewhat pollute its noise floor. The optional phono stage measures well despite its low cost. The optional digital board offers good rather than great performance. I am not surprised that EL preferred the sound of the external CEntrance DACport, which is a bit of an overachiever for the same price as the Simaudio board.           ',\n",
       " 'Art Dudley is a rapscallion. When I hoisted the Simaudio Moon Evolution i-7 onto my test bench, plugged it in, and switched it out of standby, its display lit up with the message \"HELLO JOHN.\" Switching it from Input 1 to Input 2 brought forth the command to \"BITE ME,\" while Input 3 exclaimed \"OUCH.\" Stuck up there in the wilds of upstate New York with time weighing heavily on his hands, Artie obviously had time to discover a new use for the amplifiers programmable input names!I selected \"HELLO JOHN\" with the chunky metal remote and began my test routine. With an amplifier, this always starts with my preconditioning it by running both channels for 60 minutes at one-third the specified power into 8 ohms, which is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B output stage. At the end of that hour, the Moon i-7s side-mounted heatsinks were just too hot to touch, while the chassis was warm. At the start of the hour, the THD+noise measured 0.019%; after 60 minutes it had dropped inconsequentially, to 0.018%.The maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same for both the unbalanced and balanced inputs, at a moderate 36.3dB, and all the inputs preserved absolute polarity; ie, were non-inverting. The gain at the preamp output jacks was 5.5dB, and these had a source impedance of 50 ohms across the band as specified. The balanced input is wired according to the AES convention, with pin 2 hot and pin 3 cold. At low and midrange frequencies the input impedance with the volume control at its maximum was a reasonably high 19k ohms unbalanced and 32k ohms balanced, but dropped at 20kHz to 5k ohms and 14k ohms, respectively.   Sources with tubed output stages might sound a little rolled-off due to the Ohms Law interaction between the high source impedance and the change in the Moons input impedance.The i-7s output impedance was a very low 0.05 ohm in the bass and midrange, rising to a still low 0.07 ohm at 20kHz  . As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response with changing load impedances was minimal  . With the volume control at its maximum setting  , the Moons ultrasonic bandwidth extended to –3dB at 91kHz. Reducing the gain to unity   raised the 3dB-down frequency very slightly, to 95kHz, but the audioband response was just as flat. With its wide bandwidth, the i-7 reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with short risetimes but no hint of overshoot or ringing  . The 1kHz squarewave   was essentially perfect.Fig.1 Simaudio Moon i-7, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 16, 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Fig.2 Simaudio Moon i-7, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was superb in the midrange and below, at better than 100dB, but it did decrease to a still good 64dB at 20kHz, due to the usual capacitive coupling. Assessed under the worst-case situation, with the input shorted but with the volume control set to its maximum, the i-7s signal/noise ratio was a good 65.2dB  , and improved to 74.8dB when A-weighted.The Moon amplifier easily exceeded its specified 150Wpc output power, reaching the 1% THD clipping point at 200W into 8 ohms   and 326W into 4 ohms  . The manner in which the THD+N percentage changes with output power into these two loads is shown in  .3. Note that the 4-ohm trace stops at 326W; this is because the 8A rear-panel fuse blew at that point. Replacing it brought the amplifier back into operation, but the incident suggested that it would be unwise for me to try sustained high-power testing into loads lower than 4 ohms.Fig.3 Simaudio Moon i-7, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 4, 8 ohms.The shape of the traces in  .3 suggests that the actual distortion rises out of the amplifiers noise floor at around 20W, so I plotted how the THD+N percentage changes with frequency at 13V, equivalent to 21W into 8 ohms. The results are graphed in  .4: other than the high treble, where there is a slight rise, there is very little change as the load impedance halves. Adding to that good result, the distortion content is heavily third-harmonic  , with some second harmonic becoming apparent at high powers  . Both of these harmonics are subjectively innocuous, provided the underlying nonlinearity doesnt give rise to excessive intermodulation distortion—and, as is shown by  .7, even at a very high output into 4 ohms, the distortion products associated with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones are very low in level.Fig.4 Simaudio Moon i-7, THD+N  vs frequency at 13V into  : 2, 4, 8, 16 ohms  .Fig.5 Simaudio Moon i-7, 1kHz waveform at 21W into 8 ohms  , 0.0136% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Simaudio Moon i-7, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Simaudio Moon i-7, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Simaudios Moon Evolution i-7 amplifier offers excellent measured performance, as I have come to expect from this Montreal-based company.

       " '  AVM Ovation A6.2 ME    .   amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. The manual states that the A 6.2 ME can get warm. At the end of the preconditioning, its heatsinks were very hot, at 132.3°F  , and the top panels temperature was 110.4°F  . Operating the amplifier at the older IHF recommendation for preconditioning—both channels driven at one-third power for 60 minutes—the temperatures increased slightly, with the heatsink measuring 140°F   and the top panel measuring 113.9°F  . Be sure to give this amplifier plenty of ventilation.I looked first at the AVMs behavior via its line inputs, mostly with the volume control set to its maximum of \"99.5,\" then at lower settings. With the optional attenuation bypassed with the menu, the maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was a high 47.8dB for both the balanced and single-ended inputs. With the attenuation switched into the circuit, set to 6dB, the gain was reduced by exactly 6dB.   The maximum gain at the headphone outputs was 21.75dB without attenuation, 15.75dB with 6dB attenuation. At the preamplifier output, the maximum gain was 12.2dB with and without attenuation. The Ovation A 6.2 preserved absolute polarity at its loudspeaker, preamplifier, and headphone outputs   for both balanced and single-ended line inputs.The Ovation A 6.2 MEs single-ended input impedance was 10k ohms at low and midrange frequencies, dropping slightly to 9.4k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was lower, at 6.8k ohms across the audioband. The single-ended preamplifier output impedance was a low 46.8 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. The balanced impedance was exactly twice that value, as expected. The headphone output impedance was a very low 0.5 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz but rose to a still-low 7.6 ohms at 20kHz. The AVM should not have problems driving low-impedance headphones  .The amplifiers output impedance was a very low 0.07 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.09 ohms at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was minimal  . The small-signal bandwidth into resistive loads with the volume control set to its maximum was flat to 20kHz, not reaching –3dB into 8 ohms until 120kHz  , although a slight, 0.15dB channel imbalance can be seen in this graph. This wide small-signal bandwidth was preserved at lower settings of the volume control. The amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured very short risetimes. A slight amount of overshoot can be seen, but there was no ringing. A 1kHz squarewave was perfectly square  .Fig.1 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Treble and Bass controls each offer seven steps of boost or cut. Their effect set to \"+7\" and \"–7,\" with the volume control set to \"79.5,\" is shown as the blue and red traces in  .4. Each step of the Treble control boosts or cuts the output above 10kHz by 2dB. The Bass control operates in smaller steps, but instead of a conventional Baxandall-type control, it boosts or cuts the output between 50Hz and 500Hz and rolls off the output below 50Hz. The Contour control provides a traditional \"Loudness\" function for low-level listening and has 10 settings. The green and gray traces in  .4 were taken with it set to the maximum. The treble is boosted by 5.5dB and the 50–500Hz region by the same amount as when the Bass control was set to \"7.\" With the Contour set to \"3,\" the treble is very slightly attenuated, and the bass boost peaks just above 4dB.Fig.4 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, response with Treble and Bass controls set to \"0\"and \"±7\" and Contour set to \"Off\"   and with Contour set to \"10\"   and \"3\"    Channel separation   was excellent, at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz and still 80dB at the top of the audioband. With the unbalanced input shorted to ground, the volume control set to its maximum, and attenuation bypassed, the wideband, unweighted S/N ratio was 59.1dB  , ref. 2.83V output into 8 ohms. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 68dB, while switching an A-weighting filter into circuit further improved the ratio to 70.3dB. Activating the attenuation increased all these ratios by around 3dB. The level of the Ovation A 6.2s noise floor depended on the volume control setting. Even with the control set to its maximum, no supply-related spuriae were present in the amplifiers low-frequency output spectrum  . When the volume control was set to –20dB  , the random noise was lowered by 20dB, which shows that the source of the noise, which in any case is probably inconsequential, is before the volume control.Fig.5 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with attenuation active and volume control set to –20dB   and its maximum  .To reduce the influence of the random noise floor on the distortion measurements, I performed all of these with the attenuation active and the volume control set to –20dB. AVM specifies the Ovation A 6.2 MEs maximum power as 300Wpc into 4 ohms  . With both channels driven and using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the amplifier clipped at 190Wpc into 8 ohms  , 315Wpc into 4 ohms  , and 505W   with one channel driven into 2 ohms  . The headphone output clipped asymmetrically at just over 1V into 300 ohms under all circumstances measured: with attenuation active or bypassed, with both balanced and unbalanced input signals, and regardless of the volume control setting. This will not be an issue with high-sensitivity headphones, but it correlates with Herbs observation that the AVM couldnt drive his low-sensitivity HiFiMan Susvaras to appropriate levels without clipping.Fig.6 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.As the distortion at low powers was very low, I measured how the Ovation A 6.2s distortion changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD+N percentage was very low into all three impedances at low frequencies  , but the increase in the treble implies a relatively restricted open-loop bandwidth.  Fig.9 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The distortion was predominantly the third harmonic  , with the higher odd-order harmonics all lying below –100dB and decreasing in a linear manner with frequency  .   The reduction in high-frequency linearity seen in  .7 led to the production of high-order intermodulation products with an equal high-power mix of 19kHz and 20Hz tones  . The difference product at 1kHz lay at a low –86dB  , however.Fig.10 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.024% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.12 AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Other than the random noise that comes before the volume control and the reduction in linearity in the treble octaves, the AVM Ovation A 6.2 ME did well on the test bench, slightly exceeding its specified power. I was puzzled by the headphone jacks limited output voltage, but that might well be a sample-specific problem.           ',\n",
       " '  Naim Uniti Nova     and before I did so, I installed the Naim app on my iPad mini and used it to reset the Naim to the factory default settings.   Usually, before I test an amplifier, I precondition it with both channels driving a 1kHz tone at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. However, the Naim turned itself off after 15 minutes, displaying the message \"Over temperature, please wait for the product to cool down.\" The top panel above the side-mounted heatsinks was indeed very hot, at 118.1°F  . After the Uniti Nova had cooled down a bit, it turned itself back on and I continued the testing.Looking first at the analog inputs, the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 35.35dB. The gain at the preamplifier outputs was 6.7dB. These inputs preserved absolute polarity    at all three sets of outputs. The input impedance was a usefully high 50k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 42k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone output impedance was extremely low, at 0.5 ohms at all audio frequencies. The output impedance at the speaker terminals was 0.3 ohm at all audio frequencies; as a result, the modulation of the Naims frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.2dB  . The response is down by 2dB at 20kHz, and, peculiarly, it drops off very rapidly above 20kHz. When I looked at the Uniti Novas reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave  , I understood what was happening. The overshoot and ringing indicate that the Naim converts its analog inputs to digital, apparently with a sampling rate of 48kHz. This means, of course, that a 10kHz squarewave will be reproduced as a sinewave  , all the odd-order harmonics that contribute to the square shape being stripped off by the anti-aliasing filter. The volume control operated in steps of approximately 0.4dB, with the unity-gain setting at \"43\" of a possible 100. However, as set the analog inputs overloaded at 2.65V, which means that source components with a maximum output level higher than this should be avoided.Fig.1 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation via the analog inputs was good rather than great, at 71dB R–L and 84dB L–R at 2kHz, decreasing by 20dB at the top of the audioband  . Spectral analysis of the Naims low-frequency noise floor   revealed a somewhat high level of random noise, as well as AC supply components at 120 and 240Hz.   The unweighted wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the input shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, the worst case, was just 63.9dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This improved slightly, to 66.6dB, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 69.3dB when A-weighted.Fig.4 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 5 and 6 plot the percentage of THD+noise in the Naims output against power into 8 and 4 ohms. Specified as delivering 80Wpc into 8 ohms   and 155Wpc into 4 ohms  , the Uniti Nova delivered 103Wpc into 8 ohms at clipping   with both channels driven  , and 160Wpc into 4 ohms  . The wall voltage was a little high   when I performed this test with the Naim clipping, which goes some way toward explaining why it delivered more than its specified power. I measured how the THD+N varied with frequency at a level, 20V, where I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise  . While there was a rise in THD in the top two octaves, this was relatively small. The distortion itself comprised the relatively innocuous second and third harmonics  , and intermodulation distortion was respectably low in level  .Fig.5 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 40W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Naim Uniti Nova, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the Uniti Novas behavior with digital data, I tested it using the Audio Precisions TosLink and coaxial S/PDIF inputs, and repeated the tests with WAV, AIFF, and DSD files stored on an SDcard that I plugged into the rear-panel port. The Naim successfully played PCM data sampled up to 384kHz, as well as both DSD64 and DSD128 files. With the volume control set to \"100,\" a 1kHz tone at –20dBFS gave rise to an output of 558mV at the preamplifier outputs, 158mV from the headphone jack, and 15.23V from the speaker outputs, the latter equivalent to 29W into 8 ohms. As the amplifier clips at 28.7V, this suggests that the volume control not be set above \"65\" with digital sources. With all but the low-level tests,   Uniti Novas digital performance at the preamplifier outputs, but with the volume control set to avoid clipping at the speaker terminals.The Naims impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a minimum-phase type, with all the ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the Uniti Novas response didnt start to roll off until just below half the sample rate  . An alias at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   is therefore visible. Distortion harmonics of this tone are also visible, the second harmonic being the highest in level at –66dB  .Fig.10 Naim Uniti Nova, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.11 Naim Uniti Nova, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .When  Naims digital frequency response with S/PDIF data, I got what appeared to be anomalous results  . With 44.1kHz data   the output stopped just above 20kHz, but with data sampled at 96kHz   and 192kHz   the ultrasonic response was down by 9dB at 29kHz. These responses were measured at the preamplifier outputs; repeating them at the speaker terminals gave the same result, other than the rolloff above 20kHz being slightly faster. As a check,   responses again using WAV files stored on an SD card, but found no differences from S/PDIF data. The Uniti Novas Burr-Brown DAC chip does function at sample rates up to 192kHz; I suspect that the Uniti Nova downsamples high-resolution data so that its DSP can be applied to those data.Fig.12 Naim Uniti Nova, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .When the Uniti decoded dithered 16- and 24-bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, with the volume control set to \"100\" to minimize the effect of its selfnoise, the increase in bit depth dropped the noise floor by around 20dB  , which implies resolution of greater than 19 bits. With an undithered 16-bit tone at exactly–90.31dBFS   the waveform was symmetrical, but the three DC voltage levels described by the data are somewhat obscured by high-frequency noise. With undithered 24-bit data   the result was a somewhat noisy sinewave.Fig.13 Naim Uniti Nova, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.14 Naim Uniti Nova, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit TosLink data  .Fig.15 Naim Uniti Nova, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit TosLink data  .As suggested by  .11, the digital inputs distortion signature was primarily the subjectively benign second harmonic  , and while actual intermodulation distortion was low in level  , the noise floor didnt look random. With 16-bit J-Test data, the resultant spectra   were identical, whether I fed the Naim optical or coaxial S/PDIF data, or played the same data stored on the SDcard. A slight widening of the spectral spike that represents the high-level tone at one-quarter the sample rate can be seen, but all the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave are reproduced at the correct levels  . However, a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz can be seen in the left channels output, these obviously related to the power supply. These sidebands are also evident with 24-bit J-Test data  , though the spectrum is otherwise superbly clean.Fig.16 Naim Uniti Nova, digital input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 0dBFS  .Fig.17 Naim Uniti Nova, digital input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.18 digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit TosLink data  .

Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Other than its idiosyncratic behavior with high-sample-rate data, the Naim Uniti Novas measured performance reveals it to be well sorted, as they say in the UK.

       " '  Pass Laboratories INT-60    .   amplifier by running it with both channels driven at one-third power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes. This is, thermally, the worst situation for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage, as one-third power is when the output transistors dissipate the most heat. At the end of the hour, the highest temperature on the side-mounted heatsinks was 114.7°F  , and that on the top panel, which was highest toward the rear, was 107.1°F  . The THD+noise measured a constant 0.084% throughout this hour.The volume control operated in accurate 1dB steps, and the voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum measured 28.6dB for both balanced and unbalanced input signals. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The input impedance was usefully high, measuring 90k ohms balanced and 75k ohms unbalanced at low and middle frequencies. The impedance dropped slightly at the top of the audioband, to 80k ohms balanced and 34k ohms unbalanced, but these are still high in absolute terms.Overall, the INT-60s measured performance suggested that its circuit uses a modest amount of negative feedback, so I wasnt surprised to find that its output impedance was relatively high for a solid-state design: 0.16 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 0.35 ohm at 20kHz  . Nevertheless, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response into our standard simulated loudspeaker was fairly low, at ±0.18dB  . Pass Labs specifies the INT-60s frequency response as being down by 6dB at 80kHz. Fig.1 confirms that  ure, there being a reduction in output of just 0.25dB at 20kHz. The shape of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   had slightly slowed risetimes, but with commendable absences of overshoot and ringing. Figs. 1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum of \"63\"; there was no difference in the performance with the control set to \"40,\" and the excellent channel matching seen in  .1 was maintained at the lower setting.Fig.1 Pass Labs INT-60, frequency response with volume control set to its maximum at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Pass Labs INT-60, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation at 1kHz was excellent, at 96dB R–L and 104dB L–R, and at 20kHz was still, respectively, 80 and 87dB. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio  , taken with the input shorted to ground but the volume control set to \"63,\" was 76.5dB. This increased to 84dB with an A-weighting filter; spectral analysis of the low-frequency noise floor while the INT-60 drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms revealed the presence of some low-level, supply-related spuriae  . These were not affected when I experimented with the ground connection between the INT-60 and the Audio Precision test system. Those spuriae at 60Hz and its odd harmonics, which will be due to magnetic interference from the power transformer, are higher in the right channel  , perhaps because that channels circuits are closer to the transformer—but none of the spuriae are anywhere close to high enough to approach audibility.Fig.3 Pass Labs INT-60, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The INT-60 is specified as delivering 60Wpc into 8 ohms   at 1% THD+N; as shown in  .4, our sample clipped at 79Wpc with both channels driven into that load  . The distortion begins to rise out of the noise at around 2W, and the gentle rise in THD+N above that power suggests that only a modest degree of negative feedback is used. Into 4 ohms  , the amplifier clipped at 125W  , a slightly higher power than the specified 120Wpc, while with one channel driven into 2 ohms  , the INT-60 clipped at 200W  .Fig.4 Pass Labs INT-60, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Pass Labs INT-60, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Pass Labs INT-60, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The Pass Labs was less comfortable driving 2 ohms than it was with higher impedances, as shown by  .7, which plots the percentage of THD+N against frequency into 8, 4, and 2 ohms at a fairly high level, 12.65V, equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms, 40W into 4 ohms, and 80W into 2 ohms. Note that with the limited amount of negative feedback used, the distortion rises in the upper octaves—although, as high-level content above 10kHz is very rare in music, this decreasing linearity shouldnt affect sound quality.Fig.7 Pass Labs INT-60, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .At low frequencies, the predominant distortion harmonic is the subjectively benign second  , though at 1kHz, the third harmonic rises higher in level than the second  . Despite the increase in its harmonic distortion in the top octave, the INT-60 did relatively well on the punishing high-frequency intermodulation test, even at a fairly high power into 4 ohms  . The second-order or difference component resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lies at a respectably low –67dB  , though the higher-order components at 19 and 21kHz are a little higher in level, at –60dB  .Fig.8 Pass Labs INT-60, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Pass Labs INT-60, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.08% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Pass Labs INT-60, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Pass Labs INT-60, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms  .As I have come to expect from Pass Laboratories, the INT-60 offered respectable measured performance that included a careful balance of the consequences of the limited amount of negative feedback used. Im a little suspicious of the change from predominantly second- to third-order harmonic distortion as the frequency rises, as I feel that amplifiers that maintain a constant distortion signature sound better. However, its as fair to concede that I have no actual evidence that that is true in this case as it is to note that Herb Reichert loved the INT-60s sound.           ',\n",
       " 'Sidebar Measurements  Rega Brio,    . Via its line inputs, the Brios maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was typical for an integrated amplifier, at 39.55dB. The amplifier inverted absolute polarity for line input signals at both the speaker terminals and headphone jack, and its input impedance at 20Hz and 1kHz was, at 41k ohms, fairly close to the specified 47k ohms. Though the line input impedance dropped to 36k ohms at 20kHz, this will be inconsequential.The headphone output impedance was a high 107 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz, so will not be optimal with low-impedance headphones. However, the output impedance at the speaker terminals was very low, measuring just 0.06 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to a still-low 0.15 ohm at the top of the audioband. As a result, the change in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker, due to the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and that of the load, was minimal  , and there was very little difference between the response into 8 ohms   and those into lower impedances. However, this graph reveals the Brio to have a relatively limited small-signal bandwidth, the –3dB point lying at 41kHz. This results in increased risetimes in the Regas reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  , although, commendably, no overshoot or ringing can be seen. The traces in  .1 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum; at lower settings of the control, there are no changes either in the response or in the superb channel matching.Fig.1 Rega Brio, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Rega Brio, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was good, though it was greater from right to left than in the other direction, those crosstalks respectively lying at –78 and –65dB. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, taken with the line inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum—the worst possible case—was okay, at 65.5dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased the ratio to 69.35dB, while switching an A-weighting filter into circuit resulted in further improvement, to 72.2dB.   Fig.3 indicates that the measured S/N ratios are due to both random noise and spuriae at the power-supply–related frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics.Fig.3 Rega Brio, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Specified as offering maximum powers of 50Wpc into 8 ohms   and 73Wpc into 4 ohms  , both channels driven, the Brio actually delivered slightly more power at clipping, which we define as when the level of THD+noise in the amplifiers output reaches 1%. Figs. 4 and 5 show how the percentage of THD+N changes with output power into, respectively, 8 and 4 ohms. You can see that while the Brio offers very low THD+N, it does clip quite sharply, reaching 1% THD+N at 52Wpc into 8 ohms   and 80Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.4 Rega Brio, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Rega Brio, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.To be certain I was looking at actual THD rather than noise, I plotted   the way the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a fairly high level, 8.9V, which is equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms and 20W into 4 ohms. Even so, the percentage at low and middle frequencies was very low—much lower than what I found with the original Brio, which Wes Phillips reviewed in 1998. But as with that early Brio, the THD+N increased in the top octaves, presumably due to the circuit having limited open-circuit loop gain. This means that the amount of corrective negative feedback available decreases as the frequency rises, and to a greater extent in the right channel   than in the left  .Fig.6 Rega Brio, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion itself is heavily second-harmonic in nature  , which would be benign even if it were a lot higher than it is in the Regas output  . However, this graph reveals that some higher-order harmonics are present, particularly in the left channel  , where theyre almost as high in level as the second—if you can refer to anything at or below –94dB   as \"high.\" Despite the decreasing linearity in the top audio octave, the Brio did relatively well when I fed it an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level just below visible waveform clipping into 4 ohms  . When I repeated this test at 1W into 8 ohms  , the difference product at 1kHz lay at just –84dB  .Fig.7 Rega Brio, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.029% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Rega Brio, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Rega Brio, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Rega Brio, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms  .The Brios phono input offered 39.9dB of gain measured at the Tape Out jacks, and 79.6dB at the speaker terminals with the volume control set to its maximum. The input impedance was 44k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to 36k ohms at 20kHz. Both the gain and impedance are appropriate for moving-magnet cartridges. The phono input inverted polarity at the speaker terminals but preserved polarity at the Tape Out jacks.The RIAA equalization   was superbly accurate, with a slight downward slope in the upper bass and the two channels very closely matched. Channel separation was also excellent, and the Brios phono input was very quiet, the unweighted, wideband S/N ratio   measuring 68.8dB. This improved to 79.9dB with an A-weighting filter in circuit.Fig.11 Rega Brio, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .Phono overload margins were superb, at 27dB at 20Hz and 1kHz, and though the margin decreased to 24.5dB at 20kHz, this is still excellent. I had to raise the input level at 1kHz to 21mV to see what distortion harmonics were present; even at this level, only the second and third harmonics could be seen  , and these respectively lay at –106 and –114dB  . Intermodulation distortion was also extraordinarily low  .Fig.12 Rega Brio, phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2V into 100k ohms  .Fig.13 Rega Brio, phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 2V peak into 100k ohms  .Regas Brio is a well-sorted little amplifier, as the Brits say, and I was especially impressed by its moving-magnet phono stage. But it runs hot: after 60 minutes of driving one-third its clipping power into 8 ohms, the temperature of its side panels was 135.6°F  .           ',\n",
       " 'Sidebar 4: Tri-Vista kW Measurements  kW using a separate power supply for each channel. The amplifier offered a slightly higher-than-usual voltage gain of 30.1dB into 8 ohms. It preserved absolute polarity, and its input impedance at 1kHz was a very high 230k ohms. Though this dropped to 166k ohms at 20kHz, the kWs input impedance is so high that it will not load the preamp to any appreciable extent.The amplifiers output impedance was 0.11 ohm over most of the audioband, rising slightly, to 0.18 ohm, at 20kHz.   The modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms Law interaction between its source impedance and the impedance of the loudspeaker will therefore be just ±0.1dB, as shown by  .1. This graph also shows that while the amplifier has a wide small-signal bandwidth into 8 ohms—3dB down at 130kHz—this bandwidth decreases into lower loads. Into 2 ohms, for example  , the -3dB point drops to 55kHz, the kWs output now -1dB at 20kHz. Even so, the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   was clean, with only a faint hint of incipient overshoot evident on its leading edge.Fig.1 Musical Fidelity kW, frequency response at  : 2.83V into simulated loudspeaker load, 1W into 8 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, 4W into 2 ohms  .Fig.2 Musical Fidelity kW, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio with its input short-circuited was a moderate 75.5dB  . The  ure improved to 88dB when A-weighted, which is equivalent to 118dB ref. full power. As with earlier Musical Fidelity power amplifiers, distortion was extraordinarily low and even across the audioband, though it did increase as the load impedance dropped  . Figs.4 and 5 show that the third harmonic is predominant at high power levels. Though a smattering of higher-order harmonics is present, these are, again, all at very low levels. The subjectively benign second harmonic was the highest in level at low powers  , but was buried beneath the kWs noise floor. Intermodulation distortion was also very low, though driving the amplifier at high power into low impedances brought the 1kHz difference product up to a still minimal -90dB    .Fig.3 Musical Fidelity kW, THD+N   vs frequency  : 10V into 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.Fig.4 Musical Fidelity kW, 1kHz waveform at 250W into 4 ohms  , 0.0047% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.5 Musical Fidelity kW, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC-1kHz, at 1000W into 4 ohms  .Fig.6 Musical Fidelity kW, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-24kHz, 19+20kHz at 900W into 4 ohms  .Finally, the kW is aptly named  , delivering just over one continuous kilowatt of power into an 8 ohm load: 1100W, or 30.4dBW! This increased to 1800W into 4 ohms   and 2.5kW into 2 ohms    . However, it should be noted that my wall voltage drooped during this final measurement, from 126.5V to 121V. The resistance of the owners AC wiring will be what limits the kWs ability to deliver prodigious current into low-impedance loudspeakers.

       " '  Bluesound Powernode  , then repeated some tests with the magazines more recent APx500 system. I connected the Powernode to my network and controlled it with the Bluesound app on my iPad mini.   I used the apps \"Customize Inputs\" screen to disable \"A/V mode\" on the inputs with which I was going to do the testing, as this is said to be best for audio-only sources.As the amplifier has a class-D output stage, I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter between the test load and the analyzers. This filter eliminates RF noise that could drive their input circuitry into slew-rate limiting. I used it for all the loudspeaker output tests other than frequency response. After two hours of operation, the temperature of the amplifier chassis was only slightly warmer than room temperature, at 93.9°F   on the bottom panel, a few degrees lower in temperature on the top panel.I looked first at the Bluesounds performance via its single-ended analog inputs. The input impedance was a relatively low 7k ohms at 20Hz, dropping slightly to 6.4k ohms at 20kHz. The maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 34dB with the tone controls bypassed; it was 6dB lower with the controls active but set to 0dB. At the headphone output the gain was –3.15dB, ie, an input of 1V resulted in an output of 696mV. The Powernode preserved absolute polarity from both the speaker and headphone outputs.The Bluesound amplifiers output impedance at the headphone output was a very low 1 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz. The output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 0.1 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising very slightly to 0.12 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore negligible, at ±0.1dB  . The response into resistive loads   and from the headphone output rolled off rapidly above 20kHz, which suggests that the Powernode digitizes its analog inputs, most probably with a sample rate of 44.1kHz. The rolloff meant that the Bluesounds reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was a pure sinewave  . A 1kHz squarewave was reproduced with ringing on its leading edges  , confirming that there is analog/digital conversion.Fig.1 Bluesound PowerNode, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms   4 ohms  ,    .Fig.2 Bluesound PowerNode, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Bluesound PowerNode, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The bass and treble controls offered a maximum boost and cut of ±6dB  , which explains the 6dB reduction in maximum gain with them active.  Fig.4 Bluesound PowerNode, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum and switched out of circuit  .Channel separation was okay, at >60dB in both directions below 1.5kHz, but 40dB at the top of the audioband. Without the auxiliary low-pass filter, there was 220mV of ultrasonic noise present at the loudspeaker outputs. With the filter, the Bluesounds unweighted, wideband signal/ noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, was good, at 64.4dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms  . This ratio improved slightly to 65dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 74.5dB when A-weighted. The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics  . The blue and red traces in this graph were taken with the volume control set to the maximum. Reducing the volume by 20dB lowered the levels of the 60Hz component by the same 20dB, and the higher-order harmonics disappeared beneath the random noisefloor.Fig.5 Bluesound PowerNode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, volume control set to maximum   and to –20dB  .With both channels driven, the Powernode met its specified continuous maximum power into 8 ohms of 80Wpc   at 1% THD+noise  . However, very little more power was available into 4 ohms, the Bluesound clipping at 84Wpc into that load  . I didnt test clipping power into 2 ohms as the amplifier isnt specified into that load. The distortion lies below the noisefloor at low powers, so I examined how the THD+N varied with frequency at 12.65V, which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms and 40W into 4 ohms. Fig.8 shows that the distortion at low frequencies is the same into both impedances, at 0.02%–0.03%. It does rise at higher frequencies, with some peculiar frequency-dependent behavior in the top octave.Fig.6 Bluesound PowerNode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Bluesound PowerNode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Bluesound PowerNode, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion was predominantly low-order harmonics  , which was confirmed by the spectrum of the Powernodes output when it drove a 50Hz tone at 20Wpc into 8 ohms  . The subjectively benign second and third harmonics are the highest in level, each lying at –80dB  . The second harmonic rose a little at the same voltage into 4 ohms  , though the third dropped slightly. When the Bluesound amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 20W peak into 8 ohms, all the intermodulation products lay at or below –80dB   in both channels  . The digitizing results in aliased images of the tone at 24.1kHz and 25.1kHz, confirming that the A/D converter operates at 44.1kHz.Fig.9 Bluesound PowerNode, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.053% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Bluesound PowerNode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Bluesound PowerNode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms  .  Bluesound Powernodes D/A performance primarily using its TosLink S/PDIF input, repeating some of the tests with WAV files on a USB drive plugged into the rear-panel USB port. I initially performed the measurements at the headphone output, then repeated some tests at the loudspeaker output.The Bluesound Powernodes optical input locked to data sampled up to 192kHz, and absolute polarity was preserved with this input and with WAV files on the USB stick. With the volume control set to its maximum, 1kHz digital data at –20dBFS resulted in a level at the headphone output of 144mV and at the loudspeaker outputs of 10.29V. The latter is 7.9dB below the Bluesounds clipping voltage into 8 ohms. It appears, therefore, that the digital inputs have around 12dB of excess gain. I therefore continued the testing with the volume control set to –12dB to avoid driving the output stage into clipping with high-level digital signals.The impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a minimum-phase type, with all the ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the Powernodes response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression at 24kHz, just above half the sample rate  . The aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   is suppressed by 56dB, and the distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone all lie at or below –70dB. Some odd, low-level noisefloor modulation is present in the spectrum of the 19.1kHz tone, which was taken at the loudspeaker outputs. This behavior was absent when I repeated the measurement at the headphone output, but the tones third harmonic had risen to –40dB  .Fig.12 Bluesound PowerNode, Toslink input, impulse response  .Fig.13 Bluesound PowerNode, Toslink input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .The digital-input frequency response with 44.1kHz data was flat in the audioband with then a sharp rolloff just below half the sample rate  . The levels of the two channels were perfectly matched. The high-frequency rolloff doesnt seem as steep with 96kHz data   and 192kHz data  , but this is due to the presence of aliased images.Fig.14 Bluesound PowerNode, Toslink input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noisefloor dropped by 10dB, which implies that the Powernode offers close to 18 bits worth of resolution. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were obscured by high-frequency noise. Intermodulation distortion via the Bluesounds digital inputs, measured at the loudspeaker outputs  , was very similar to the behavior with analog input signals. It was higher at the headphone output, however, the difference product at 1kHz lying at –70dB compared with –84dB.Fig.15 Bluesound PowerNode, Toslink input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.16 Bluesound PowerNode, Toslink input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.17 Bluesound PowerNode, Toslink input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .  Powernode for its rejection of word-clock jitter via its TosLink and USB inputs. The odd-order harmonics of the 16-bit J-Test signals LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were obscured by the random noisefloor with both the loudspeaker outputs and the headphone output. However, the noise sidebands centered at ±1166Hz in the loudspeaker spectrum   were absent from the headphone output.Fig.18 Bluesound PowerNode, Toslink input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.To some extent the Bluesound Powernodes measured performance is affected by noise contamination from the class-D output stage. Overall, however, it did well on the testbench, especially considering its affordable price.           ',\n",
       " 'To precondition an amplifier before testing, I run it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. For an amplifier with a class-B output stage, this thermally stresses the amplifier to the maximum extent. To my alarm, after 15 minutes of driving 67Wpc into 8 ohms, the top panel of the KAV-400xi above the internal heatsinks was way too hot to touch, implying a temperature well above 60ºC; the chassis was also too hot to touch and smelled of hot insulation. More alarming, the distortion level, a good 0.05% when the amplifier was cold, had risen to 0.15% and was continuing to rise. Worried about the amplifier being damaged by thermal runaway, I concluded the preconditioning at that point.The Krell is one of an increasing number of wide-dynamic-range amplifiers that do not have sufficient heatsink area to allow continuous high-power operation. This tradeoff may permit a product to be competitively priced—using appropriately sized heatsinks for a 200Wpc amplifier would significantly increase its cost—but it needs to be pointed out. While it is unlikely the Krell will overheat in normal use, it may well do so when used for a party.The KAV-400xis input impedance at 1kHz was a usefully high 47k ohms, double that for the balanced input. The amplifier was noninverting through both balanced and unbalanced inputs, and the maximum voltage gain was 35.7dB.   The 152-position volume control operated in approximately 0.2dB steps at the extremes of its range, these increasing to 0.4dB steps in the middle of the range and 0.7dB steps around the unity-gain setting of \"39.\" The \"0\" position mutes the output.The output impedance was a little higher than usual for a solid-state design, at 0.35 ohm across most of the audioband, this rising slightly at 20kHz. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response reached ±0.25dB, when it drove Stereophiles simulated speaker load  . Into resistive loads, the response was flat in the audioband, with a very slight rise below 20Hz and a high-frequency -3dB point of 134kHz, which correlates with excellent 1kHz and 10kHz squarewave shapes  , there not being any hint of overshoot or ringing. The response was the same through both balanced and unbalanced inputs, and was not affected by the setting of the volume control.Fig.1 Krell KAV-400xi, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms  .Fig.2 Krell KAV-400xi, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Krell KAV-400xi, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was excellent in the audioband, at better than 85dB, L-R, and 80dB, R-L, in the treble; beneath 1kHz, the crosstalk was buried in the noise floor. With the high gain, however, the amplifiers signal/noise ratio    with the input shorted and the volume control set to \"151\" was good rather than great, at 62.2dB, wideband. This increased to 71dB when A-weighted.The noise presumably contributes to the shape of the THD+noise curves plotted against output power  , where the downward slope with increasing power is due to the reducing proportion of a constant noise level. However, looking at the distortion spuriae on an oscilloscope revealed there to be distortion harmonics in the noise, and, as I found with the preconditioning, this level increased as the amplifier got hotter. The important point to note from  .4 is that the Krell comfortably exceeds its specified output power. No fewer than 290W were available with both channels driven into 8 ohms   at our normal 1% THD definition of clipping, with 350W available into 4 ohms  . However, with one channel driven into 2 ohms, that channels rear-panel 3A fuse blew at 500W output  , which is why the trace in  .4 ends at that point. Replacing the fuse restored the amplifier to normal operation.Fig.4 Krell KAV-400xi, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.Concerned about the temperature-dependent nature of the amplifiers linearity,   manner in which the KAV-400xis THD+noise percentage varied with frequency at a moderately high level   into 2, 4, and 8 ohms. The results are shown in  .5: the audioband distortion is nicely below 0.1% into 8 ohms, with the right channel a little more linear than the left. A rise in THD above the audioband gets more severe into the lower impedances, but this is nothing to be concerned about. I then repeated the measurement after running the amplifier at 67Wpc into 8 ohms for 15 minutes. The results are shown in  .6. Again, the rise in distortion above 20kHz can be seen, but now the audioband distortion has tripled!Fig.5 Krell KAV-400xi when cold, THD+N   vs frequency at 16V into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms  .Fig.6 Krell KAV-400xi when hot, THD+N   vs frequency at 16V into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms  .Of more subjective importance than the absolute level of an amplifiers distortion is its spectrum, with low-order harmonics being more benign than high-order. Unfortunately, the Krells distortion waveform   suggests the presence of both, the spikes in the waveform coinciding with the zero-crossing points. This measurement was taken with the amplifier very hot, hence the highish distortion level of 0.47%. The level was lower with the amplifier cold, but the spikes increased in amplitude as it warmed up.Fig.7 Krell KAV-400xi when hot, 1kHz waveform at 2.3W into 4 ohms  , 0.47% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .This is shown in a different manner in  .8, the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove a 50Hz tone at half power into 4 ohms. A regularly decreasing series of odd harmonics can be seen, interspersed with a lower-level series of even harmonics. The fact that the harmonics decrease in level with increasing order might mitigate their audibility, but I must admit to some alarm at seeing this behavior. Finally, the decrease in the circuits linearity at high frequencies, referred to earlier, results in rather more intermodulation products than I like to see in the high-power, high-frequency intermodulation test  , taken just below the level that caused visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope screen. However, this is at a very high output power; the spuriae fell rapidly with decreasing power.Fig.8 Krell KAV-400xi, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC-1kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Krell KAV-400xi, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC-24kHz, 19+20kHz at 350W peak into 4 ohms  .Summing up the Krell KAV-400xis measured performance is difficult, as some of its odd behavior will not be an issue when it comes to playing back music at normal listening levels. It is also possible that our sample was defective, though the fact that both channels behaved similarly is evidence for that not being the case. But I would avoid pairing the amplifier with loudspeakers that drop below 4 ohms—such as Krells own Resolution 1—and would make sure it had adequate ventilation.           ',\n",
       " '  Lamm M1.2 Reference, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  . Before testing one of the monoblocks, I ran it at 1/3 its rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes, which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-A/B output stage. The output-stage bias switch was set to \"1–6 ohms,\" which was how I had found the amplifier to sound best. At the end of that period the chassis was hot, with a temperature of 109.6°F  , and the heatsinks a little hotter at 111.1°F  . However, as the Lamms output stage is richly biased into class-A, it behaves somewhat differently from a class-A/B design; after an hour of running at idle, the chassis and heatsinks were only a couple of degrees   cooler. These temperatures are lower than with our 2004 samples; however, I had performed the 2004 testing with the higher-impedance bias setting and twice the power.The voltage gain was higher than usual, at 31.6dB with both balanced and unbalanced inputs and at both bias settings, and both inputs preserved absolute polarity, the balanced XLR being connected with pin 2 hot, and the unbalanced input being connected to the positive RCA jack and the negative shorted to ground, as suggested in the manual. The unbalanced input impedance was 39k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 27k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was twice these values, as expected.The output impedance at the \"1–6 ohms\" setting was 0.15 ohm at low and middle frequencies, rising to 0.18 ohm at 20kHz. At the \"8–16 ohms\" setting the impedances were 0.17 and 0.2 ohm, respectively. These  ures are a little lower than with our 2004 sample, and also quite low in absolute terms, meaning that the variation of the M1.2s frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was also low, at ±0.15dB  . The Lamm has a wide small-signal bandwidth, the response into 8 ohms   not reaching –3dB until 165kHz, which gives its reduction of a 10kHz squarewave short risetimes  . Commendably, neither this graph or the 1kHz squarewave   shows any trace of overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Perhaps due to the its higher-than-normal gain, the original Lamms signal/noise ratio was good rather than great, at 72.2dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  . The 2012 sample was slightly noisier, at 68.2dB, which was not affected by experimenting with the ground connections between the amplifier and the Audio Precision, even when I floated the signal generators output and ran a separate ground wire to the terminal post on the M1.2s rear panel. Switching in an A-weighting filter increased this  ure to 77dB. Although in my listening Id heard no noise problems unless I pressed my ear against the speaker, I investigated further: Fig.4 shows an FFT analysis of the M1.2s low-frequency noise floor while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms. A series of 60Hz-spaced components can be seen between –77 and –90dB, these obviously stemming from the power supply and most likely due to magnetic interference from the large transformer that lies underneath the small-signal circuitry.Fig.4 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Biased for \"1–6 ohms\" operation, the M1.2 Reference clipped at 95W into 8 ohms   and 173W into 4 ohms  , the latter well above its specified power of 110W into 4 ohms  . The \"8–16 ohms\" clipping powers were 180W into 8 ohms   and 295W into 4 ohms  . The gentle rise in the THD+noise percentage between the point where actual distortion emerges from the noise floor   and where actual waveform clipping begins suggests that only a modest amount of loop negative feedback is used in the M1.2.Fig.5 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"8–16 ohms,\" distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.I plotted how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at an output level   where I could be sure that I was examining actual distortion rather than noise. Even so, the THD didnt change at all with frequency, and actually decreased slightly into lower impedances  , which suggests that the M1.2 Reference has a wide open-loop bandwidth. In addition, the distortion at low power is predominantly second harmonic in nature  , something that always makes an amplifier more listenable. The third harmonic begins to dominate at high powers and currents, with some higher-order harmonics evident  , but this should have no subjective consequences. The M1.2s good linearity at high frequencies means that, even at a level close to clipping, the intermodulation products resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones remain at or below –66dB    .Fig.7 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" THD+N   vs frequency at 8.95V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  , 0.04% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 127W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Lamm M1.2 Reference, \"1–6 ohms,\" HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 128W peak into 4 ohms  .Overall, though there are some differences in detail, these measurements are not substantially different from those I found with our 2004 sample of the M1.2 Reference, which suggests both excellent consistency in manufacturing and high-quality audio engineering.

       " 'I used the top-of-the-line   system   to measure the Vincent SV-236MK; for some tests, I also used an Audio Precision System One Dual Domain.As usual, before performing any tests, I ran the Vincent for 60 minutes at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms, which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. The measured distortion+noise was 0.021% with the amplifier cold; at the end of the hours preconditioning, it had risen inconsequentially, to 0.022% and the heatsinks were around 60°; ie, just too hot to touch. Unlike a number of amplifiers I have measured recently, the Vincent has enough heatsink capacity for its specified output power.The maximum voltage gain measured at the speaker terminals into 8 ohms was a high 48.66dB. Measured at the preamplifier output jacks, the maximum gain was 18.1dB, which is also somewhat on the high side. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity, ie, was non-inverting, from both sets of outputs. The input impedance was lower than the specified 47k ohms but still fairly high at 41k ohms at low and middle frequencies. It dropped slightly but inconsequentially to 36k ohms at 20kHz. The source impedance from the preamplifier output jacks was a high 2.3k ohms at high and midrange frequencies, rising to an even higher 4.1k ohms at 20Hz. However, the source impedance from the speaker terminals was a low 0.09 ohms over almost all the audioband, rising slightly to 0.12 ohms at 20kHz. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker remained within ±0.1dB limits  .Fig.1 was taken with the volume control at its maximum, and the channel matching can be seen to be superb. However, at lower settings of the control, an imbalance of up to 0.4dB appeared, in favor of the left channel. The Vincent amplifier has a wide small-signal bandwidth, its output not dropping by 3dB until 120kHz. As a result, its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave featured very short risetimes, as well as a complete lack of overshoot or ringing  . These   with the tone controls and Loudness defeated. The top and bottom pairs of traces in  .3 show the effect on the SV-236MKs small-signal response of the Bass and Treble controls set to their maximum and minimum positions, respectively. The boosts and cuts are usefully moderate, with the exception of the treble cut, which is a bit too aggressive. The central pair of traces in this graph show the Vincents response with the tone controls in-circuit but set to their central detented positions. Both the bass and treble regions suffer some boost in this condition. The effect of the Loudness button is shown in  .4. The effect will vary with the volume control setting—it was set to –20dB or 1:00 for this measurement—but the treble boost does seem excessive compared with the low-frequency boost.Fig.1 Vincent SV-236MK, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Vincent SV-236MK, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Vincent SV-236MK, response with, from top to bottom: treble and bass controls set to maximum, detented zero, and minimum, with volume control set to –20dB  .Fig.4 Vincent SV-236MK, loudness contour with volume control set to –20dB  .Channel separation   was good rather than great, at 70dB below 1kHz in both directions. Perhaps as a result of its high gain, the Vincent also offered modest signal/noise ratios. With the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum  , the unweighted wideband ratio ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms   was just 63.5dB. This improved to 68.4dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 70.6dB when A-weighted. I suspect, therefore, that the specified \"80dB\" was referenced to the amplifiers maximum power rather than to the usual 1W.Fig.5 plots the THD+noise percentage in the Vincents output power against output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. With both channels driven, the SV-236MK meets its specified maximum power of 150Wpc into 8 ohms   at clipping  . However, it falls a little short into lower impedances, delivering 231Wpc into 4 ohms rather than the specified 250Wpc  . With one channel driven into 2 ohms, the amplifier clipped at 362W  , but didnt otherwise misbehave into this low impedance.Fig.5 Vincent SV-236MK, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2  ohms.The traces in  .6 show how the THD+N percentage changes with frequency. I chose a fairly high level—20V RMS—to perform this set of measurements, in order to be sure I was at a level where the actual distortion would not be buried within the noise. There is only a slight increase in THD at the top of the audioband, which suggests that the Vincent has quite a wide open-loop bandwidth. The distortion approximately doubles as the load impedance halves, which is what I expected from  .5. But you can also see that the right channel   is significantly more linear than the left channel  . Fig.6 Vincent SV-236MK, THD+N   vs frequency at 16V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The spectral content of the Vincent SV-236MKs distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second-harmonic in nature  , though higher-order harmonics appear as higher powers   and output currents  . This last graph also shows that the less-good linearity of the left channel compared with the right is almost entirely due to an increase in the amount of third harmonic. Note also in this graph the presence of AC power-supply components at 120Hz, 180Hz, 240Hz, 420Hz, etc. Though these all lie beneath –90dB, they do indicate that the amplifier is working close to the edge at these power levels. These spuriae can also be seen as the rise in the noisefloor to the left of the spectrum in  .10, which analyzes the Vincents output as it drives an equal combination of 19kHz and 20kHz tones into 4 ohms, at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen. Actual intermodulation is fairly low, however, with a kHz difference component reaching –70dB   and all the higher-order components lying at or beneath –84dB  .Fig.7 Vincent SV-236MK, 1kHz waveform at 48W into 8 ohms  , 0.03% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Vincent SV-236MK, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Vincent SV-236MK, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 190W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Vincent SV-236MK, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 190W peak into 4 ohms  .The Vincent SV-236MK measures well considering its $1995 price.

       " '  Rogue Audio Pharaoh II  . As the Rogues output stages operate in class-D, all the measurements other than frequency and RIAA responses were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which reduces the level of noise above 80kHz and eliminates noise above 200kHz. Without the filter, 376mV of ultrasonic noise was present at the loudspeaker terminals, with a center frequency of 428kHz.Looking first at the line-level inputs, the Rogue Pharaoh II preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting from its loudspeaker output with both balanced and single-ended inputs but inverted polarity from the headphone output. With single-ended input signals, the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was 37dB from the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms and 21.4dB from the headphone output. The gains with the balanced input were 6dB lower rather than the usual 6dB higher. The balanced input impedance was a very high 380k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz and still very high at 310k ohms at 20kHz. The single-ended input impedance was still usefully high, at 28.5k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 23.5k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone outputs source impedance was a low 1 ohm across the audioband. The loudspeaker output impedance was very low, at 0.05 ohms at low and middle frequencies, increasing very slightly to 0.075 ohms at the top of the audioband. The variation in the Rogue amplifiers small-signal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore less than ±0.1dB  . Into resistive loads  , the Pharaoh IIs frequency response was down by 1dB at 25kHz. Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum and the balance control centered. The right channel was 0.2dB higher in level than the left; this slight imbalance was the same at lower settings of the volume control. The Pharaoh IIs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   showed only the slightest hint of overshoot, with no ringing.Fig.1 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Pharaoh IIs channel separation   was >70dB in both directions below 1kHz but decreased to 36dB, R–L, and 40dB, L–R, at 20kHz. Taken with the AUX-0025 filter installed, the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground, and the volume control set to its maximum, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   was 64.2dB  . This ratio only improved by 1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and by another 2dB when A-weighted.Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Rogue amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms, with the volume control set to the maximum  , revealed a relatively high level of AC-related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, which will be due to magnetic interference from the large toroidal power transformer, perhaps entering via the steel pins of the 12AU7 input tubes. Setting the volume control to –12dB   reduced the levels of these spuriae by approximately the same 12dB, which means that the noise pickup occurs before the volume control. Repeating the spectral analysis with the balanced input   reduced the levels of these supply-related spuriae by the same 6dB as the reduction in gain with this input.Fig.3 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum   and to –12dB    .Rogue specifies the Pharaoh IIs maximum power as 250Wpc into 8 ohms   and 400Wpc into 4 ohms  , both powers equivalent to 24dBW. With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—I measured clipping powers of 240Wpc into 8 ohms  , and 380Wpc into 4 ohms   with both channels driven.   The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the measured THD+N is dominated by noise below 2W and that the amplifier uses a limited amount of loop negative feedback, presumably, given the high linearity of the NCore output stage, in the tubed stage.Fig.4 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency into 8 and 4 ohms at 20V, equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms   and 100W into 4 ohms  . The THD+N was close to 0.2%   across the audioband into both load impedances. This level of distortion might be audible if it was comprised of high-order harmonics like the 5th and 7th. Fortunately, the distortion waveform was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  . Intermodulation distortion, even at high powers, was relatively low, with the 1kHz difference product produced by the Pharaoh II driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms lying at –60dB  . The higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were much lower in level.Fig.6 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.19% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .  behavior of the Rogues phono input, I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the Rogues rear panel to obtain the lowest noise. The phono input inverted absolute polarity at the headphone output in both MM and MC modes but preserved polarity at the loudspeaker outputs. The maximum gain at 1kHz at the speaker outputs was 76.8dB   and 97.5dB  . At the headphone output, the maximum gain was 61.2dB   and 81.9dB  . I performed all the subsequent testing using the headphone output, and, other than S/N ratio, with the volume control set to –20dB in order to avoid clipping.With the input impedance set to 47k ohms, I measured 47k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. With the impedance set to 1000 ohms, I measured 986 ohms across the audioband; set to 300 ohms, the impedance was 302 ohms; and set to 100 ohms, it was 101 ohms. The phono inputs audioband RIAA error was very low in the right channel  , though a little higher above 2kHz in the left channel  . The low frequencies rolled off below 80Hz, reaching –3dB at 20Hz.Fig.10 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .With the MM phono input, the wideband, unweighted S/N ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a very good 74.1dB in both channels, ref. 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 75dB, while an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 80dB. The S/N ratios in MC mode were 20dB lower, but this is still a relatively quiet phono stage.Measured at the headphone output, the phono inputs overload margins were relatively high at all audio frequencies: >16dB in both MM and MC modes, ref. 1kHz at 5mV for MM and ref. 1kHz at 500ÊV for MC. The phono distortion signature was pure second harmonic, lying at –60dB   with the nominal MM input level of 1kHz at 5mV  . The level of the 1kHz difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones   was similar to that with the line inputs, though high-order intermodulation products were much lower in level.Fig.11 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 5mV input, measured at headphone output  .Fig.12 Rogue Audio Pharaoh II, MM phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz for 100mV input, measured at headphone output  .The Rogue Audio Pharaoh IIs measured performance indicates that it resembles an intriguing marriage between a low-distortion, low-noise, high-power class-D output stage and a higher-distortion, higher-noise, tubed input stage. At the time of writing I had not seen HRs review; Ill be interested to read his take on the Pharaoh IIs sound character.           ',\n",
       " '  Exposure 2010S by running a 1kHz sinewave at 25Wpc into 8 ohms for an hour. After 30 minutes the chassis was very hot, with even the volume control too hot to touch. The amplifier didnt shut down, however. The distortion level was initially 0.035% at this power level, rising slightly at the end of the preconditioning period to 0.048%.Looking first at the preamp output, this offered a maximum gain of 17.15dB rather than the specified 18dB, sourced from a low 69 ohms impedance.   The preamp output didnt invert absolute polarity, and neither did the main speaker outputs. The amplifier itself offered a maximum gain into 8 ohms of 40.83dB and its input impedance was 18.5k ohms over most of the audioband, dropping slightly to 16k ohms at 20kHz.The 2010Ss output impedance was a moderately high 0.33 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.36 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the interaction between this impedance and that of our simulated loudspeaker resulted in a response variation of ±0.25dB, which might be just audible  . This graph also shows that, like earlier Exposure designs, the 2010S has a curtailed ultrasonic response  , which results in an output down 0.75dB at the top of the audioband. Note the channel imbalance in  .1; the volume control was set to 12:00 for this set of measurements, and the right channel is 0.25dB louder than the left at this setting.Fig.1 Exposure 2010S, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms  .This imbalance decreased to 0.05dB, but now favoring the left channel, with the control set to its maximum position, but increased to 0.6dB with the control at 9:00. However, the amplifiers overall frequency response was identical at all settings of the volume control, something that is becoming rare in high-end amplifier design. The rolloff above the audioband resulted in lengthened risetimes in the Exposures reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . However, it performed superbly with a 1kHz squarewave  .Fig.2 Exposure 2010S, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Exposure 2010S, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was an adequate 66dB over most of the audioband, decreasing to 63dB at 20kHz. Of more practical concern was the crosstalk between adjacent inputs. While better than 70dB below 300Hz with the undriven input unloaded, the separation decreased to 40dB at 20kHz. Depending on the source components impedance, the Exposures owner might hear a wispy trace of whatever is plugged into the adjacent input. It might be a good idea to plug shorting RCA plugs into unused inputs.The Exposures signal/noise ratio was good rather than great, at 69dB   ref. 1W into 8 ohms, this improving to 75.7dB when A-weighted. Both  ures were taken with the input shorted and the volume control set to its maximum  . However, I did note the presence of some low-level 120Hz hum that I couldnt eliminate by experimenting with the grounding between the amplifier and my Audio Precision test set, as well as some very-low-frequency noise below 5Hz, though this, too, was at a very low level.Delivering 81W into 8 ohms   with both channels continuously driven at the 1% THD+noise clipping point  , the Exposure 2010S exceeded its specified power by 0.35dB. It gave 105W into 4 ohms  , again at 1% THD+N. Into 2 ohms, however, with one channel driven, the amplifier went into protection at 103W  , this indicated by the premature cutoff of the relevant trace in  .4. Turning the amplifier off, then on, restored normal operation.Fig.4 Exposure 2010S, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.At low power levels into 8 ohms, the harmonic distortion remained below 0.05% below 10kHz, and rose slightly above that frequency  . It more than doubled into 4 and 2 ohms, but was still less than 0.1% below the top audio octave. The presence of some low-level 120Hz hum results in the notch at that frequency in this graph, the hum being out of phase with the signal.Fig.5 Exposure 2010S, THD+N  vs frequency at 4.85V into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms  .Of more subjective importance than the absolute level of an amplifiers distortion is its spectrum. The waveform of the small-signal THD+N residual   indicates a mix of second and third harmonics, though at low frequencies and high powers   the second harmonic is highest in level, at –68dB  . The power-supply components at 120Hz and 240Hz can be seen in this graph, at –72dB   and –80dB  , respectively. When asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 4 ohms just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen, the Exposure produced rather more intermodulation components than I expected. The 1kHz difference tone lay at –56dB   whether the amplifier was driving 8 or 4 ohms  .Fig.6 Exposure 2010S, 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  , 0.055% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 Exposure 2010S, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 95W into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Exposure 2010S, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 110W peak into 4 ohms  .That aside, and taking into account its relatively low price, the Exposure 2010S offers a sensible set of engineering compromises. However, nothing in these measurements indicates why it should sound as good as it does.           ',\n",
       " ' , I thermally stress it by running both channels for 60 minutes into 8 ohms at one-third the specified power—in the case of the Naim Supernait, 27Wpc. The THD+noise percentage was 0.025% at the beginning of that period; it hadnt significantly changed at the end, by which time the amplifiers case was quite hot, though not so that I couldnt keep my hand on it.Looking first at the Naims digital input, it locked on to data with sample rates ranging from 32 to 96kHz, and the input was non-inverting. A signal at 0dBFS gave a level that clipped the Supernaits main output with the volume control at 10 oclock. With the volume control full, a digital signal at –26.5dBFS clipped the speaker outputs, meaning that the amplifier as a whole has way too much gain for its digital input. Surprisingly, the frequency response above the audioband with 96kHz-sampled data, assessed at the tape output   merely continued the slight top-octave rolloff evident with CD data  , with a –3dB point of 31kHz. The output with CD data was down 0.25dB at 20kHz, and the channels were very well matched in level.Fig.1 Naim Supernait, frequency response into 100k ohms with external data sampled at 96kHz   and at 44.1kHz  .  Spectral analysis of the Supernaits tape output while it decoded dithered 16-bit data representing a 1kHz tone at –90dBFS have the top pair of traces in  .2. The tone peaks at the correct level, and the high-frequency noise floor is that of the recorded dither. However, at lower frequencies, there is a bump to –117dBFS at the supply-related frequency of 60Hz. Extending the word length to 24 bits and driving the Supernait with dithered data representing 1kHz tones at –90dBFS and –120dBFS gave the middle and bottom pairs of traces in  .2. The noise floor drops by 15dB at high frequencies, suggesting a true D/A resolution of around 18 bits, but a series of odd-order AC-supply harmonics are unmasked in the bass and midrange.Fig.2 Naim Supernait, 1/3-octave spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, 16-bit data   and 24-bit data  ; and of 24-bit dithered tone at –120dBFS  .  I experimented with the grounding between the Supernait and both of my measurement setups—Stereophiles vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain, and a new   we have on loan  —and couldnt eliminate this low-level hum. As the hum occurs at the supply frequency of 60Hz and its odd harmonics rather than at the full-wave–rectified supply frequency of 120Hz, I suspect it is due to magnetic coupling from the large toroidal transformer rather than some kind of grounding problem. Yes, these components are at a very low level, but I would rather not have seen them at all.DAC linearity error, assessed with 24-bit data, was negligible  , and the Naims reproduction of an undithered tone at –90.31dBFS was superb, with good waveform symmetry and a clean depiction of the three DC voltage levels  . Word-clock jitter, assessed with the Miller Audio Research Analyzer, was quite low, at 367 picoseconds peak–peak. The spectrum of the Naims output while it reproduced the jitter test signal   was dominated by data-related sidebands, these close to the residual level.Fig.3 Naim Supernait, left-channel departure from linearity, 24-bit data  .Fig.4 Naim Supernait, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.5 Naim Supernait, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal  , 16-bit external data sourced from PC via 15 TosLink. Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz  .Turning to the analog domain   and looking at the speaker-level outputs, the Supernaits line-level inputs gave a maximum gain into 8 ohms of 49.5dB, which is significantly higher than usual for an integrated amplifier. The input impedance was a usefully high 64k ohms at 1kHz, dropping slightly but inconsequentially at the frequency extremes, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity; ie, was non-inverting.The output impedance was a little higher than usual for a solid-state design, at 0.3 ohm across most of the audioband. As a result, the modifications of the amplifiers response by the usual Ohms Law interaction between its output impedance and the impedance of the speaker was a mildly audible ±0.3dB  . Into resistive loads, the output rolls off quite quickly above 20kHz, resulting in relatively leisurely risetimes on the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . Channel separation   was only moderately good, at 70dB or higher below 2kHz, while the Supernaits unweighted signal/noise ratio, assessed with the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum, was compromised by the high gain and by the residual 60Hz hum, at 56dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms. The A-weighted  ure was better, at 64.5dB left and 67.5dB right.Fig.6 Naim Supernait, left-channel frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8  , 4  , 2   ohms  .Fig.7 Naim Supernait, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 4 ohms.Fig.8 shows how the THD+N percentage in the Naims output varies with output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The downward slope of the traces below 20W indicates that the reading is dominated by noise rather than distortion. Defining clipping as 1% THD, the Naim more than meets its specified power into 8 ohms, at 89Wpc   with both channels driven. It clipped at 140Wpc into 4 ohms  , but turned off at 141W into 2 ohms to protect itself, which is why the trace in  .8 ends at that point. Reducing the drive signal allowed the amplifier to turn itself back on.Fig.8 Naim Supernait, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4 ohms.Fig.9 plots how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 8V, equivalent to 8W into 8 ohms  , 15W into 4 ohms  , and 32W into 2 ohms  . It stays commendably low at all frequencies, partly because the background noise still contributes to the reading. At a slightly higher power into 8 ohms  , the distortion is primarily the benign second harmonic, but still overlaid with noise despite my having averaged 32 separate readings to produce this graph.Fig.9 Naim Supernait, left-channel THD+N   vs frequency at 8V into: 8  , 4  , 2   ohms.Fig.10 Naim Supernait, 1kHz waveform at 18W into 8 ohms  , 0.02% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Even at high powers, the distortion remained predominantly second-harmonic in nature  . The second harmonic in this graph lies at –72dB   and the third at –84dB  . But note that the power-supply component at 180Hz is almost as high as the second harmonic, especially in the right channel  , and that a regular series of off-order power-supply harmonics extends across the spectrum. As I conjectured earlier, I suspect that this behavior is due to magnetic interference from the toroidal transformer that dominates the Supernaits interior. These spuriae can also be seen, albeit at a low level, in the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it reproduced an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 4 ohms at a level just below visible clipping on the screen of the oscilloscope with which I monitor my measurements  . Actual intermodulation is commendably low, however, with the 1kHz difference component lying at –83dB and the higher-order components at 18kHz and 21kHz at –79dB.Fig.11 Naim Supernait, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 110W into 4 ohms  .Fig.12 Naim Supernait, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .In many ways, the Naim Supernait offers excellent measured performance. Its D/A section is also good, and not just an afterthought. But the presence of the 60Hz AC-supply components in its output, even though they lie at a low level, did concern me, and the amplifiers ultimate noise performance is compromised to an extent by the higher-than-necessary gain.

       " 'Because of the VAC Statement 452 iQs bulk and weight, I drove my   system and its host PC  , test loads, digital and analog oscilloscopes, cables, and other gear to Michael Fremers place for the measurements. The only space available for me to set everything up was in the garage, along the corridor from Michaels basement listening room. I ran two extension cables from a 20A outlet in the corridor, one for the test system and the other for one of the amplifiers  . I later repeated some of the testing on the other amplifier, SN 1929702. The graphs in this report show the results with SN 1929702, which has slightly lower distortion in the treble. The two samples otherwise behaved identically.The Statement 452 iQ can be used as a two-channel amplifier, but as Michael had exclusively performed his listening with a pair of the amplifiers connected as monoblocks, that is how I tested it. I made sure I connected the test loads to the third, right-most pair of binding posts, which were labeled Mono, and that both switches on the rear panel were set to Mono. As the VAC amplifiers output in this mode floats with respect to ground, I left the analyzers input floating. I connected the Audio Precisions signal generator outputs, balanced or single-ended, to the right channels input jacks, which is how Michael had been using the amplifiers. I let the amplifier warm up before performing any testing, and the LEDs on the front panel indicated that all was well with the eight KT88 output tubes.The VACs voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 27dB from both inputs, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  . The balanced input impedance was a usefully high 96k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 92k ohms at the top of the audioband. The unbalanced input impedance was a high 83k ohms at 1kHz but, unusually, dropped to 3.2k ohms at 20Hz and 8.85k ohms at 20kHz.The Statement 452 iQs output impedance was 0.94 ohm at all audio frequencies, which is low for a tube amplifier. As a result, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was relatively small, at ±0.7dB  . The response into resistive loads   was flat in the audioband, with then a steep rolloff above 100kHz. A very small peak just before the ultrasonic rolloff is associated with the VACs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  , which features a small amount of overshoot and three damped cycles of ultrasonic ringing. A 1kHz squarewave was reproduced with superbly flat tops and bottoms  , confirming the extended low-frequency response, a tribute to the amplifiers output transformers.Fig.1 V.A.C. Statement 452 IQ, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 V.A.C. Statement 452 IQ, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.When I repeated the frequency response measurement with the single-ended input  , the ultrasonic rolloff started a little earlier, at 60kHz rather than 100kHz, and the low-frequency output gently sloped down below 400Hz, reaching –1dB at 30Hz. This behavior might have been associated with the reduced input impedance at low frequencies. It wouldnt have affected Michaels auditioning, as he exclusively used the balanced input. However, it does suggest that the VAC amplifiers balanced input is to be preferred to the single-ended input.Measured with the balanced input shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 68.7dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms, increasing slightly to 69.2dB when I restricted the measurement bandwidth to the audioband. When the reading was A-weighted, the S/N ratio improved further to a good 83.75dB. With no signal  , spuriae were present at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its harmonics. The odd-order harmonics, which will be due to magnetic interference from the power transformer, were lower in level than the even-order harmonics, which are due to a nonzero impedance to ground somewhere in the circuit. Peculiarly, when I drove the amplifier with a balanced 1kHz tone, with the output equal to 1W into 8 ohms, not only did the low-frequency noise floor rise by about 10dB  , but sidebands spaced at 120Hz now accompanied the 1kHz tone. I have no idea where these sidebands come from, but they remained unchanged when I experimented with different cables and grounding arrangements between both samples of the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer.Fig.3 V.A.C. Statement 452 IQ, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms   and with no signal  .VAC specifies the Statement 452 iQs maximum power when used as a monoblock as 450W into 4 ohms  . With our usual definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the VAC clipped at 235W into 8 ohms  . However, less power was available into 4 ohms at 1% THD+N: 183W  , though 370W was available at 3% THD+N   and 410W at 10% THD+N  . I doubt that this shortfall in maximum power into 4 ohms would have affected the auditioning. Given the high sensitivity of the Wilson speakers, Michael was never asking the amplifiers to deliver more than 40W or so.Fig.4 V.A.C. Statement 452 IQ, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 V.A.C. Statement 452 IQ, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 12.65V, which is when the distortion in  s.4 and 5 begins to rise above the noise floor. This voltage is equivalent to 10W into 16 ohms, 20W into 8 ohms, 40W into 4 ohms, and 80W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was commendably low in the treble into 16 and 8 ohms  , but rose at lower frequencies and into lower impedances. The distortion at 40W into 4 ohms   was still acceptably low, but at 80W into 2 ohms, it rose above 1% at the frequency extremes. This suggests that the single secondary winding of the Statement 452 iQs output transformer is optimized for loads of 8 ohms rather than the 4 ohms specified by the manufacturer.Fig.6 V.A.C. Statement 452 IQ, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the VAC amplifiers distortion in the midrange and above was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  . The level of the third harmonic was below that of the second at low frequencies into 8 ohms   but, peculiarly, spurious tones were present at frequencies mathematically related to the 50Hz signal and 60Hz and its even-order harmonics. This odd behavior was also present at the same voltage in 4 ohms, though the third harmonic of the 50Hz tone was now equal in level to the second  . Intermodulation distortion when the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 20W into 8 ohms   was commendably low, the second-order difference product at 1kHz lying at –82dB  . Higher-order products were also low in level.Fig.7 V.A.C. Statement 452 IQ, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.047% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 V.A.C. Statement 452 IQ, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Valve Amplification Company Statement 452 IQ, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms  .In some ways, the Valve Amplification Company Statement 452 iQ did well on the test bench. The wide small-signal bandwidth, the excellent squarewave reproduction, the low intermodulation distortion, and the very low distortion in the treble at low-to-moderate powers into high impedances are commendable. But the shortfall in maximum power into 4 ohms and the supply-related spuriae present in the noise floor did concern me. Footnote 1: With the amplifier idling, the AC line voltage was 119V. This dropped to 117.5V with the amplifier clipping into 8 ohms. The shortfall in power wasnt due, therefore, to an unusually low line voltage.          ',\n",
       " 'I measured Ayre Acoustics EX-8 Integrated Hub    .  ing, I updated the firmware over my network and ran the EX-8 at one-third power into 8 ohms. At the end of that period its top panel was warm, at 107.1°F  . However, the bottom panel, which acts as the heatsink for the output devices, was hot, at 124.8°F  . EX-8 owners should make sure the amplifier is well ventilated.Looking first at the line-level analog inputs: With the volume control at its maximum setting, the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 26dB from the speaker terminals for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs. This is on the low side for an integrated amplifier. The maximum gains from the headphone outputs were 9.4dB balanced and 3.4dB unbalanced. The line inputs preserved absolute polarity   from all outputs. The unbalanced input impedance was 18k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping very slightly to 17k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced value, as expected. These impedances are very much lower than the specified, respectively 1M ohm and 2M ohms  , but are still high enough not to load down source components.The single-ended headphone output impedance was a low 3.7 ohms at all audio frequencies. The balanced output impedance was twice this value, as expected, but still low in absolute terms. The output impedance at the speaker terminals   was 0.45 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz. This is relatively high for a solid-state design, presumably due to the lack of open-loop negative feedback around the output stage, and resulted in a modulation of the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker of ±0.3dB  . The response was flat to 20kHz into resistive loads  , rolling off above the audioband to reach –3dB above 200kHz. Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the response didnt change at lower volume settings. However, an imbalance developed in favor of the left channel at lower settings of the volume control, reaching a maximum difference of 0.9dB at –20dB, but less at higher and lower settings. The Ayres reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   was superbly square, with short risetimes, but with a very slight but critically damped overshoot visible.Fig.1 Ayre EX-8, analog input, volume control at max, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Ayre EX-8, analog input, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 2kHz, decreasing to 80dB at 20kHz, which I assume is due to capacitive coupling between the channels. With the analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured 75.25dB in the left channel and 73.8dB in the right, both results superb. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 85.7dB in both channels, and an A-weighting filter increased it further, to 88.5dB. Levels of residual spuriae at the AC power-line frequency and its harmonics were very low  .Fig.3 Ayre EX-8, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The EX-8 is specified to deliver a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive in both channels, the Ayre exceeded that spec by 0.2dB, delivering 105Wpc into 8 ohms  . With both channels driven into 4 ohms, the EX-8 clipped at 125W  . The distortion was extremely low below 1W into either impedance, but rose to 10W or so, then decreased slightly before actual waveform clipping occurred.Fig.4 Ayre EX-8, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.5 Ayre EX-8, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms, both channels driven.Measured against frequency at a moderate output level, 8.95V—equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms, 20W into 4 ohms, and 40W into 2 ohms—the distortion levels were respectably low into the two lower impedances  , but the EX-8 was less happy driving 2 ohms  . The shape of the distortion-spuriae waveform indicated the presence of higher-order harmonic products  . Spectral analysis indicated that the third harmonic was the highest in level, with higher odd-order harmonics present  . Second-order intermodulation distortion at a relatively high power into 8 ohms was very low, the product at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at –99dB  . High-order products were present at higher levels, and these further increased when I repeated the test into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Ayre EX-8, analog input, distortion   vs frequency at 8.95V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Ayre EX-8, analog input, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.025% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Ayre EX-8, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Ayre EX-8, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Turning to the digital inputs, the EX-8s AES/EBU and coaxial and optical S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz, and preserved absolute polarity. Apples USB Prober utility identified the EX-8 as \"Ayre USB Interface\" from \"Ayre Acoustics\" with the serial number \"Streamlength .\" USB Prober confirmed that the EX-8s USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the EX-8s USB port could handle 24-bit integer data at all sample rates up to 384kHz. A 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in an output level of 17.32V into 8 ohms with the volume control at its maximum setting, which suggests that the digital inputs have too much gain—ie, a digital signal at –7dBFS with the volume control up full will just drive the amplifier into clipping into 8 ohms. Using the menu to turn off the speaker outputs, I continued testing the digital inputs from the balanced preamplifier outputs.The Ayres impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that its reconstruction filter is a short minimum-phase type, with a small degree of ringing following the single sample at 0dBFS. This impulse response is identical to that of the Listen filter used in the other digital products from Ayre that weve reviewed since the QB-9 USB DAC, in 2009. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the EX-8s response rolled off slowly above the audioband, not reaching full stop-band suppression until almost an octave above the Nyquist frequency of 22.05kHz  . An aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz   is suppressed by only 11dB, therefore. The distortion harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone are visible above the ultrasonic noise floor, the highest in level being the third, at –78dB  , but these are obscured by other aliasing products.Fig.10 Ayre EX-8, digital input, impulse response  .Fig.11 Ayre EX-8, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .When  EX-8s digital frequency response with S/PDIF data at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz, the response followed the same basic shape at each sample rate, with a slow rolloff that reached –3dB at 20kHz with 44.1kHz data  . With data sampled at 384kHz  , the output rolled off in a manner similar to the 192kHz data, but reached –9dB at 102kHz rather than at 90kHz. The output with 384kHz data was down by 24dB at 192kHz, that sample rates Nyquist frequency.Fig.12 Ayre EX-8, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor dropped by about 15dB, meaning that the EX-8 offers between 18 and 19 bits worth of resolution. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS, the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical  . With 24-bit data, the result was a well-formed sinewave  Fig.13 Ayre EX-8, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.14 Ayre EX-8, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.15 Ayre EX-8, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Intermodulation distortion via the EX-8s digital inputs was low, though a large number of aliasing products were present  . When   digital inputs rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit J-Test data, the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were all at the correct levels  , though sidebands at the power-supply–related frequencies of ±120 and ±240Hz can be seen and were also present with 24-bit J-Test data  . These sidebands were accentuated with USB data  .Fig.16 Ayre EX-8, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms, 44.1kHz data  .Fig.17 Ayre EX-8, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit AES3 data  .

Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Ayres EX-8 Integrated Hub offers generally excellent measured performance in both the analog and digital domains, but I was somewhat concerned by its harmonic distortion signature. I do wonder if using the chassis as the heatsink means that the output stage cant be biased too strongly into class-A. Footnote : This very high specified input impedance was a typo in the manual.          ',\n",
       " '  Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800      . As the amplifier is specified as having a maximum power output of 330Wpc into 8 ohms,   it before the measurements by running it at one-third that power into 8 ohms for an hour. Following that period, the top panel was warm, at 99.5°F  , and the heatsinks hotter, at 121.9°F  .With the Nu-Vista 800s volume control set to \"114.5,\" its maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms was typical for an integrated amplifier, at 42.1dB unbalanced and 42.3dB balanced. The volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps, with the error a negligible +0.13dB at a setting of \"79.5\"; ie, –35dB was actually –34.87dB. The Nu-Vista 800 preserved absolute polarity for both balanced and unbalanced inputs, its XLRs being wired with pin 2 hot. The unbalanced input impedance was 42k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping to 17.5k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 18k ohms across the audioband.The output impedance, including 6 of speaker cable, was low in the bass and midrange, at 0.095 ohm, rising to 0.15 ohm at the top of the audioband. Consequently, the modulation of the Nu-Vista 800s frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was also very low  . The amplifiers response into resistive loads was flat in the audioband, with its output into 8 ohms down by 0.5dB at 20kHz and by 3dB at 70kHz  . This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum. Commendably, both the very close channel balance and the overall response were preserved at lower settings of this control. The Nu-Vista 800 performed well with a 10kHz squarewave  , with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was superb below 1kHz, at >100dB, and still 72B at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, taken with an unbalanced input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum, was a little disappointing at 57.2dB left and 52.6dB right, both  ures ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms. These  ures improved by almost 12dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and were also sensitive to the arrangement of the ground connection between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer. Fig.3 reveals that the random components of the noise floor are higher in level than is usually found in integrated amplifiers, and that some odd harmonics of the AC supply frequency are present, perhaps due to magnetic interference from the two large toroidal power transformers.Fig.3 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  , and with input shorted    .With this higher-than-usual level of noise, the actual distortion in the THD+noise traces   doesnt rise above the noise until just below the actual onset of clipping. With continuous drive, the Nu-Vista 800 just failed to meet its specified output power of 330W into 8 ohms   with both channels driven at our usual definition of clipping: when the THD+N reaches 1%. Fig.4 indicates that the amplifier clips at 310Wpc into 8 ohms, a slight shortfall of 0.3dB, though its fair to note that I dont hold the wall voltage constant in my testing. The supply voltage was 122V AC with the amplifier quiescent, but dropped to 119.1V AC when it was clipping into 8 ohms. Into 4 ohms with both channels driven, the Nu-Vista 800 clipped at 500Wpc  . I didnt test its clipping power into 2 ohms, as Musical Fidelitys Antony Michaelson had warned me that although they test power and stability, etc., into 2 ohms, I shouldnt expect to operate the amplifier for a prolonged period at full power into 2 ohms.Fig.4 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I tested how the percentage of THD+N changed with frequency at a level at which I hoped to be able to see the contribution of distortion instead of just noise: 20V  . Even so,  .6 suggests that the THD lies beneath the noise floor below 5kHz or so into higher impedances. Though the distortion into 4 and 8 ohms is very low overall, it does rise into 2 ohms, averaging 0.01% below 1kHz and reaching 0.1% above 10kHz. Just as I finished the 2-ohm measurement, the amplifier lived up to Michaelsons warning and muted its output. I had to wait until it had cooled down before I could continue the testing.Fig.6 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The THD+N waveform   was dominated by random noise. However, spectral analysis indicated that the distortion signature was primarily the subjectively innocuous second harmonic in the left channel  , but with an equal amount of third harmonic in the right channel  . But with each harmonic at –100dB   despite the high power level, these should not cause concern for listening to music, especially as intermodulation distortion is also extremely low  .Fig.7 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.016% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .I feared for my back when I lifted the 86-lb Musical Fidelity Nu-Vista 800 onto my test bench. But when it comes to the measured performance of this handsomely styled integrated amplifier, there is nothing at all to worry about. Footnote 1: When I began testing Michael Fremers review sample of the Nu-Vista 800  , I broke it by inadvertently short-circuiting the speaker outputs at high power: As fate would have it, the output-stage devices sacrificed themselves to save the power-supply rail fuses. The measurements were therefore performed on a different sample  .           ',\n",
       " '  T+A PA 3100 HV    . The review sample did not have the Tone Control/Room Correction module fitted and neither did it have the optional PS 3000 HV auxiliary power supply. I looked first at its behavior via its line inputs, mostly with the volume control set to its maximum of \"99,\" and then at lower settings.   The front-panel meters are correctly calibrated, a power of 1W into 8 ohms being shown as \"1W.\"   amplifier by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the heatsinks were very hot, at 131.6°F  , and the top panels temperature was 103.6°F  .The maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 40.6dB for the balanced inputs, 45.6dB for the single-ended inputs. At the headphone outputs, the maximum gain measured 20.7dB and 25.7dB, respectively. The maximum gain at the preamplifier output was 14.45dB for the balanced inputs to the balanced output and 13.4dB for the unbalanced inputs to the unbalanced output. The PA 3100 HV preserved absolute polarity   at all of its outputs.The PA 3100 HVs unbalanced line input impedance is specified at 20k ohms, which was confirmed by my measurements. The balanced input impedance was 41k ohms. The preamplifier output impedance was 44 ohms across the band for the unbalanced output, 89 ohms for the balanced output. The headphone output impedance was a moderately high 47 ohms across the audioband—50 ohms is specified—meaning that low-impedance headphones will not be driven optimally by the T+A amplifier.The amplifiers output impedance was 0.15 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.17 ohms at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was minimal  . The small-signal bandwidth into resistive loads with the volume control set to its maximum was flat to 20kHz, and there was no overshoot or ringing with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . Channel matching was excellent and maintained at lower settings of the volume control. The response at the headphone jack and the balanced preamplifier output was flat in the audioband and –2.5dB at 200kHz. At the single-ended preamplifier output, the response was down by 1.5dB at 100kHz.Fig.1 T+A PA3100 HV, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.02 T+A PA3100 HV, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation via the line inputs   was excellent, at 90dB in both directions below 2kHz and still >80dB at the top of the audioband. The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, taken with the unbalanced input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was a good 69dB  , ref. 2.83V output into 8 ohms. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 78dB, while switching an A-weighting filter into the circuit further improved the ratio to 81.1dB. The level of the PA 3100 HVs noise floor depended on the volume control setting. With the control set to its maximum  , low-level supply-related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd and even harmonics were visible in the amplifiers low-frequency output spectrum  ; these were lowered by 10–15dB when the control was set to –20dB    .Fig.3 T+A PA3100 HV, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to \"79\"   and \"99\"  .T+A specifies the PA 3100 HVs maximum continuous power as 300W into 8 ohms   and 500W into 4 ohms  . With both channels driven and using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%,  .4 indicates that the amplifier clipped at 318Wpc into 8 ohms  . The T+A amplifier also exceeded its specified power into 4 ohms, clipping at 525Wpc  , again with both channels driven  .  Fig.4 T+A PA3100 HV, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 T+A PA3100 HV, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I measured how the PA 3100 HVs distortion changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The THD+N percentage was very low into both 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  . It did rise above 0.1% into 2 ohms  , but there was no rise in THD+N in the top octaves, which implies a commendably wide open-loop bandwidth. The distortion was predominantly the second harmonic  , with the higher harmonics decreasing in a linear manner with frequency  . Despite the good high-frequency linearity seen in  .6, there was a greater amount of intermodulation distortion with an equal high-power mix of 19kHz and 20Hz tones than I was anticipating  . However, the highest-level intermodulation products still lay at or below –70dB  .Fig.6 T+A PA3100 HV, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .Fig.7 T+A PA3100 HV, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.044% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 T+A PA3100 HV, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 T+A PA3100 HV, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Overall, the T+A PA 3100 HV performed very well on the test bench. It exceeded its specified power, and while distortion is not especially low, it is commendably consistent with frequency and consists primarily of the subjectively innocuous second harmonic with higher-order harmonics declining with increasing frequency.

       " '  The VPA was warmed up for approximately 15 minutes prior to any measurements being taken; according to Nagra, the amplifier should enter stable operation after this period. All measurements were made in balanced mode. The 8 ohm   from the 8 ohm outputs, 4 and 2 ohm measurements from the 4 ohm outputs.  The Nagras input impedance is too high   to measure accurately on our Audio Precision test set. The two voltages required to produce the measurement differed by mere thousandths of a volt.   Suffice it to say that this amplifiers input impedance should cause no matching problems with any competent preamplifier. Pin 2 of the balanced input is wired as positive.  The VPAs voltage gain into 8 ohms, from the 8 ohm tap, is a high 35.7dB. The measured output impedance was quite high, varying between 2.23 and 2.26 ohms depending on frequency and load impedance  . This suggests some potential frequency-response irregularities with typical loudspeaker loads.  The Nagras DC offset was unmeasurable. Signal/Noise Ratio   measured 66.2dB with a bandwidth of 22Hz to 22kHz, 66.2dB from 10Hz to 500kHz, and 80dB A-weighted.    Fig.1 shows the VPAs frequency response. The variations into our simulated real load indicate the sort of frequency-response variations this amplifier will produce into an actual loudspeaker, though the exact variations will depend on the particular loudspeaker. The 10kHz squarewave response is shown in  .2—a very good result. The Nagra has a good rise time with little rounding of the waveforms leading edge. The 1kHz squarewave   is nearly perfect.    Fig.1 Nagra VPA, frequency response into  : 1W into 8 ohms, 8 ohm tap; 2W into 4 ohms, 4 ohm tap; and 2.828V into simulated loudspeaker load, 8 ohm tap  .    Fig.2 Nagra VPA, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms, 8 ohm tap.  The low-power THD+noise vs frequency results shown in  .3 are not exceptional. While the midband linearity is excellent, the amplifier becomes increasingly nonlinear at the frequency extremes, particularly below 100Hz—when you use no feedback, increased distortion is the consequence you must accept. The waveform of the distortion   is shown in  .4. At 1W the waveform was difficult to see in the noise, but at 5W a dominant second harmonic is apparent, as well as clear signs of higher-order distortion. Into 2 ohms  , the dominant harmonic changes from second to third.    Fig.3 Nagra VPA, THD+noise vs frequency at  : 4W into 2 ohms, 4 ohm tap; 2W into 4 ohms, 4 ohm tap; 1W into 8 ohms, 8 ohm tap; and 2.83V into simulated loudspeaker load, 8 ohm tap.

Fig.5 shows the Nagras output spectrum, reproducing a 50Hz sinewave at 41W into 4 ohms. The distortion, again, is fairly high—a maximum of -43dB   at 100Hz, with a regularly descending series of higher harmonics. Fig.6 shows the intermodulation distortion resulting from a combined 19+20kHz signal at 30.7W output into 4 ohms—a level just below visible signs of clipping with this test signal. The highest artifact here, at 18kHz, is -43.9dB, or about 0.7%. There is also approximately 0.5% distortion at 1kHz  . The results are not significantly different into 8 ohms  .

The THD+noise percentage vs output power curves for 1kHz are shown in  .7. The actual discrete-clipping-point measurements   are 59.9W   into an 8 ohm load, 61.2W   into 4 ohms, and 68.1W   into 2 ohms.

It wasnt possible to measure the VPAs toneburst power with the Miller Audio Research Amplifier Profiler; its floating output con uration was not happy with the test systems ground-referenced input.  The Nagra VPAs measured performance reflects its low-feedback design. In short, acceptable, but little more, I feel.—Thomas J. Norton          ',\n",
       " 'The Technics SU-G700M2 appears to be a less powerful, less–well-equipped sibling of the Technics SU-R1000 integrated amplifier that KM reviewed in December 2021, which offered superb measured performance.   SU-G700M2  , and as the amplifier has an output stage that resembles class-D, I inserted an Audio Precision AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter between the test load and the analyzer. This filter reduces RF noise that would otherwise drive the SYS2722s input circuitry into slew-rate limiting.   I used the filter for all the loudspeaker output tests, other than frequency response.I looked first at the Technicss performance via its single-ended line inputs. The SU-G700M2 preserved absolute polarity at all outputs with Phase set to Normal. The volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps, and the maximum gain at the loudspeaker outputs was 42dB.   At the preamplifier output, the gain was 21.3dB, and at the headphone output it was 26.7dB. The SU-G700M2s power amplifier stage can be accessed separately: It offered a fixed gain of 32.4dB. The input impedance at both the line inputs and the power amplifier inputs was 32k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, with an inconsequential drop to 28.3k ohms at 20kHz.The Technics amplifiers output impedance at the headphone output was a relatively high 66 ohms. At the preamplifier output, it ranged from 781 ohms at 20Hz to 707 ohms at 20kHz. It was difficult to measure the output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals due to an increase in ultrasonic noise with no load connected, even with the Audio Precision low-pass filter in circuit. But the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between the SU-G700M2s source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker was a low ±0.25dB in the bass and midrange  , which implies that the output impedance, including the series impedance of 6 of spaced-pair loudspeaker cable, must have been close to a low 0.1 ohm.Fig.1 Technics SU-G700M2, volume control set to –12dB, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms   4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   extended to 70kHz but rolled off rapidly above that frequency. With a 4 ohm resistive load  , the output started to roll off slowly in the top audio octave, reaching –3dB at 45kHz. Into 2 ohms  , the output was down by 3dB at 20kHz, presumably due to an increase in output impedance in the top audio octave. This graph was taken with the volume control set to –12dB. The excellent channel matching was preserved at other settings of the control.Like the SU-R1000, the SU-G700M2 has the LAPC function, which is intended to compensate for the dependence of a loudspeakers impedance with frequency. I bypassed LAPC for these measurements, but its effect can be seen in  .2 in the SU-R1000s measurements.Fig.2 Technics SU-G700M2, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.There is a small, critically damped overshoot in the Technicss reproduction of a 10kHz squarewaves leading edges into 8 ohms  . The absence of Nyquist-frequency ringing from an antialiasing filter suggests either that the SU-G700M2 doesnt digitize its analog inputs or that the output stages low-pass filter removes the ringing, meaning that the A/D converter operates at 192kHz. Its tone controls offer a maximum boost and cut of close to 8dB  .Fig.3 Technics SU-G700M2, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with treble and bass controls set to \"0\" and set to \"±10\" and with midrange set to \"±10\"  Channel separation was good, at 75dB in both directions. With the auxiliary low-pass filter and the amplifier loaded with 8 ohms, its inputs shorted to ground, and the volume control set to its maximum, there was still 330mV of ultrasonic noise present in its outputs. The SU-G700M2s unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was therefore just 18.5dB ref. 2.83V in both channels. Audio Precision, though, recommends using a brick-wall filter such as the AES17 filter included on the AP 2720 when testing noise in class-D amplifiers. When that filter was employed, the signal/noise ratio improved to 64.6dB; A-weighted, the S/N ratio was 67.7dB.Spuriae at the supply frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics were present in the amplifiers output; their levels depended on the setting of the volume control. The blue and red traces in  .4 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum. Reducing the volume by 20dB significantly lowered the levels of both the supply-related spuriae and random noise  .Fig.4 Technics SU-G700M2, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, volume control set to maximum   and to –20dB  .Technics specifies the SU-G700M2s maximum power as 70Wpc into 8 ohms and 140Wpc into 4 ohms, both powers at 0.5% THD and both equivalent to 18.45dBW. We specify clipping power as when the THD+noise reaches 1%. By that measure, and with both channels driven, the Technics amplifier clipped at 80Wpc into 8 ohms   and 148Wpc into 4 ohms  . I didnt test clipping power into 2 ohms, as the amplifier isnt specified into that load.Fig.5 Technics SU-G700M2, volume control set to –12dB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Technics SU-G700M2, volume control set to –12dB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The distortion is low at low powers, so I examined how the THD+N varied with frequency at 12.65V, equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms and 40W into 4 ohms  . To prevent the residual ultrasonic noise from contaminating the THD+N reading, I used an additional brickwall low-pass filter set to 40kHz. This filter affected the THD+N reading for signals above 5kHz, but the distortion is very similar into both 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , at close to 0.05%.Fig.7 Technics SU-G700M2, volume control set to –12dB, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.65V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion waveform at this output voltage   suggested the presence of high-order harmonics. This was confirmed by spectral analysis  : The fifth harmonic in both channels, the seventh harmonic in the left channel  , and the ninth harmonic in the right channel   were almost as high in level as the second and third harmonics. Although these harmonics are low in level, lying between –80dB   and –70dB  , they could be audible at high listening levels in the region where the ear is most sensitive. Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 20W peak into 8 ohms, the intermodulation distortion products all lay at or below –80dB  . At the same output voltage into 4 ohms  , the higher-order products were slightly lower in level, but the second-order difference product at 1kHz rose to –74dB  .Fig.8 Technics SU-G700M2, volume control set to –12dB, 1kHz waveform at 20W into 8 ohms, 0.043% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Technics SU-G700M2, volume control set to –12dB, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Technics SU-G700M2, volume control set to –12dB, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 20Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Technics SU-G700M2, volume control set to –12dB, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .I looked at the Technics SU-G700M2s digital-input performance using its S/PDIF inputs, then repeated some of the tests with the USB input. The SU-G700M2s optical input locked to S/PDIF data sampled up to 96kHz, the coaxial input to data sampled up to 192kHz. Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that the USB inputs accepted 24- and 32-bit integer data sampled at rates up to 705.6kHz.   Apples USB Prober utility confirmed that the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode.The Technicss digital inputs all preserved absolute polarity. With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at –40dBFS resulted in a level at the preamplifier output of 256.9mV, at the headphone output of 480.8mV, and at the loudspeaker outputs of 2.77V. The latter voltage implies that digital data at 0dBFS will drive the amplifier into clipping. For the digital input measurements, therefore, I used the Menu to activate the –20dB input-attenuator setting. Even so, digital data at 0dBFS caused the amplifier to turn off after briefly showing the message \"F76\" on its front-panel display. The manual explains that this message means that \"An abnormality has occurred. ... The protection circuit is activated, and the power may be turned off automatically.\" To avoid damaging the power amplifier stage with high-level digital data,  digital inputs behavior at the headphone output, which mutes the loudspeaker output.The impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the reconstruction filter is a conventional linear-phase type, with time-symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS. With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the linear-phase filters response rolled off sharply above 20kHz, reaching full stop-band suppression at 24kHz, just above half the sample rate  . The aliased image at 25kHz of a 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS   is suppressed by 90dB, and the highest-level distortion harmonic of the 19.1kHz tone, the third, lay just below –70dB  . The digital-input frequency response was flat in the audioband, then rolled off sharply above half of each sample rate  . The levels of the two channels matched perfectly.Fig.12 Technics SU-G700M2, digital inputs, impulse response  .Fig.13 Technics SU-G700M2, digital inputs, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.14 Technics SU-G700M2, digital inputs, volume control set to –12dB, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .  ultimate resolution of the SU-G700M2s digital inputs, I disabled the 20dB attenuation, set the volume control to its maximum, and examined the spectrum at the headphone output with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16- and 24-bit data  . There was no reduction in the noisefloor with 24-bit data, which implies that the SU-G700M2 offers 16 bits worth of resolution. The reason for this limited resolution can be seen in  .16, which shows the waveform of a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS with undithered 16-bit data. Although the headphone amplifier is analog, the three DC voltage levels described by the data are completely obscured by high-frequency noise, presumably radiated from the switching output stage. With undithered 24-bit data  , what should have been a relatively clean sinewave was again obscured by high-frequency noise. It should be noted, however, that the noise is above the audioband.Fig.15 Technics SU-G700M2, digital inputs, volume control set to –20dB, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.16 Technics SU-G700M2, digital inputs with 20dB attenuation active, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.17 Technics SU-G700M2, digital inputs with 20dB attenuation active, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Intermodulation distortion via the Technics amplifiers digital inputs   was low, the second-order difference product at 1kHz lying at –84dB   in the left channel and –93dB   in the right. While the higher-order products were higher in level, they were at or below –70dB  .  SU-G700M2 for its rejection of word-clock jitter via its TosLink and USB inputs, using 16- and 24-bit J-Test data sampled at 44.1kHz. All the odd-order harmonics of the 16-bit J-Test signals LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were close to the correct levels  , though some modulation of the noisefloor is evident. As expected from  .16, the 24-bit noisefloor   was no lower in level than that in  .18.Fig.18 Technics SU-G700M2, digital inputs with 20dB attenuation active and volume control set to another –6dB, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Fig.19 Technics SU-G700M2, digital inputs with 20dB attenuation active and volume control set to another –6dB, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Turning to the SU-G700M2s phono input, I followed the manuals advice to connect a separate ground wire from the terminal on the amplifiers chassis to the ground of the Audio Precision analyzer. I primarily examined the phono inputs behavior at the headphone output, again to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stages with high-level signals.The Technicss phono input preserved absolute polarity in both moving magnet and moving coil modes. Set to MM, the phono input had a maximum gain of 57.7dB at the preamp outputs, 63.1dB at the headphone outputs, and 78.4dB at the speaker outputs. Set to MC, the phono inputs maximum gains were 78.7dB, 84.1dB, and 99.4dB, respectively. These values mean that clipping is possible at the outputs with high-level phono signals, so it would be best to use the optional 20dB attenuation. The phono inputs input impedance, set to MC mode, was an appropriate 120 ohms across the audioband; set to MM, the input impedance was 39k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, falling to 32k ohms at 20kHz.The SU-G700M2s RIAA correction   was well-matched between the channels with a slight downward shelf in the treble. The switchable subsonic filter   rolled off the response by 6dB at 20Hz. The MM phono inputs unweighted, wideband S/N ratio, measured with the input shorted to ground and with the volume control set to –6dB, was 35.6dB   referred to an input signal of 1kHz at 5mV. This low ratio was due to the presence of ultrasonic noise, presumably radiated from the switching output stage; restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22Hz–22kHz increased the ratio to an excellent 84dB, while switching an A-weighting filter into circuit further increased the ratio to 88.3dB. The MC inputs ratios were 14–16dB lower due to this modes higher gain.Fig.20 Technics SU-G700M2, phono input, response with RIAA correction into 100k ohms   and with subsonic filter    .The Technics phono inputs overload margins, measured with the volume control set to –30dB to avoid clipping the headphone output, were usefully high from 20Hz to 20kHz, at 16.9dB ref. 1kHz at 5mV, MM, and 16.9dB ref. 1kHz at 500µV, MC. The phono stages distortion was very low, with all the harmonics at or below –80dB  . High-order intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones, at a peak input level equivalent to 1kHz at 5mV, lay at –70dB  , with the second-order difference product at 1kHz lying at –84dB  .Fig.21 Technics SU-G700M2, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, into 100k ohms for 5mV input  .While the SU-G700M2 meets its specified power and has a phono input that offers respectable measured performance, especially in its high overload margins, the contamination of the analog phono stage and headphone outputs with ultrasonic noise and the high-order harmonics in the outputs were disappointing.

       " 'On its face, the Ayre Acoustics EX-8 2.0 Integrated Hub appears identical to the original EX-8 that I reviewed in February 2019. However, changes have been made to better allow the amplifier to drive low impedances  .   EX-8 2.0     and repeated some of the tests with the magazines APx500 system.  ing, I followed the CEAs recommendation of operating the EX-8 2.0 at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that period, its top panel was a little warmer than the EX-8s had been, at 113.1°F  , and the bottom panel, which acts as the heatsink for the output devices, was too hot to touch, at 133.6°F  . Owners of the EX-8 2.0 need to ensure that the amplifier is well ventilated.I started the measurements with the line-level analog inputs. With the volume control at its maximum setting, the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 26dB from the speaker terminals for both balanced and unbalanced inputs. Though this is low for an integrated amplifier, there wont be any issues with regular line-level source components. The maximum gain from the single-ended headphone output was 4.76dB for the balanced input and 4.5dB for the unbalanced input. The maximum gain at the Preamp/Sub outputs was 8.7dB for the balanced input to balanced output, 2.4dB for unbalanced input to unbalanced output. The line inputs preserved absolute polarity   from all outputs. The unbalanced input impedance was 18.6k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping very slightly to 16.3k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was twice the unbalanced value, as expected. While these impedances are much lower than the specified values of 1M ohm, unbalanced, and 2M ohm, balanced, they are very similar to those of the original EX-8 and high enough not to load down source components.The single-ended headphone output impedance was an appropriately low 3 ohms at all audio frequencies. The Preamp/Sub output impedance was a still-low 129 ohms, unbalanced, and 258 ohms, balanced. The left channels output impedance at the speaker terminals   was 0.35 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz. This is slightly lower than that of the original EX-8, but the right channels output impedance was higher, at 0.525 ohms. The left channels output impedance resulted in a modulation of the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker of ±0.3dB  . The response was flat to 20kHz into 8 ohms  , rolling off above the audioband to reach –3dB above 200kHz. The right channels level   was slightly lower than the lefts  , presumably due to the higher output impedance.  Fig.1 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, volume control at max, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, volume control at max, frequency response at 1V from single-ended headphone output into 100k ohms    .Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the response didnt change at lower volume settings. However, an imbalance developed in favor of the right channel at lower settings of the volume control, reaching a maximum difference of 0.9dB at –20dB.   The EX-8 2.0s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   was superbly square, with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing.Fig.3 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 2kHz, decreasing to 80dB at 20kHz, due to capacitive coupling between the channels. With the single-ended analog inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured 75.35dB  , which is superb. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 86.2dB, and an A-weighting filter increased it further, to 88.45dB. As with the EX-8, the levels of residual spuriae at the AC power-line frequency and its harmonics were very low, particularly in the right channel  .Fig.4 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Like its predecessor, the EX-8 2.0 is specified to deliver a maximum continuous output power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , the Ayre delivered 107Wpc into 8 ohms with continuous drive in both channels  . With both channels driven into 4 ohms, the EX-8 2.0 clipped at the specified 170Wpc  , compared with the EX-8s 125Wpc  . The distortion was low below 1W into either impedance, but rose at a few tens of watts, then decreased slightly before actual waveform clipping occurred.Fig.5 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.6 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms, both channels driven.Levels of distortion measured against frequency at 8.95V—equivalent to 10W into 8 ohms, 20W into 4 ohms, and 40W into 2 ohms—were respectably low into the two higher impedances  . Notably, the EX-8 2.0 had significantly lower distortion than the EX-8 at this voltage into 2 ohms  . The THD+N percentages into 2 ohms were lower than the left channels into 4 ohms  ; this was due to the fact that I could only measure one channel at a time into 2 ohms. With both channels driven at 40W into 2 ohms, the amplifier turned itself off halfway through the measurement because it detected excessive temperature, according to the front-panel display. Putting the Ayre into sleep mode, by pressing the left-hand button on the front panel for more than 3 seconds, then turning it on again brought the amplifier back into operation.Fig.7 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, distortion   vs frequency at 8.95V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The shape of the left channels distortion-spuriae waveform indicated that the EX-8 2.0s harmonic distortion was predominantly third harmonic in nature  . Spectral analysis indicated that the third harmonic was the highest in level in the left channel  , the second the highest in the right channel  , with higher odd-order harmonics present at lower levels in both channels. Second-order intermodulation distortion at moderate power into 8 ohms was very low, the difference product at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at –96dB in the left channel and –86dB in the right  . Higher-order products were present at higher levels, and the level of the difference product at 1kHz increased to –73dB when I repeated the test at the same power level into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.024% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 40Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Ayre EX-8 2.0, analog input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 20Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the digital inputs, the EX-8 2.0s AES/EBU and coaxial and optical S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with all sample rates up to 192kHz and preserved absolute polarity. Apples USB Prober utility identified the EX-8 2.0 as \"Ayre USB Interface\" from \"Ayre Acoustics\" with the serial number \"Streamlength .\" USB Prober confirmed that the EX-8 2.0s USB port operates in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the EX-8 2.0s USB port could handle 24-bit integer data at all sample rates up to 384kHz. A 1kHz digital signal at –12dBFS resulted in an output level of 18.46V into 8 ohms from the speaker outputs, 2.46V from the balanced Preamp/Sub outputs, and 1.55V with the volume control at its maximum setting. All of these are approximately 4dB below the clipping voltage from the outputs, which suggests that the digital inputs have about 8dB too much gain. However, a menu item allows the maximum level for the digital inputs to be reduced in 6dB steps.     digital inputs from the single-ended headphone output and from the balanced Preamp/Sub output with the level reduced by 8dB with the volume control.I havent discussed the EX-8 2.0s performance via its digital inputs, as this was identical to that of the original EX-8, with a short, minimum-phase, slow-rolloff reconstruction filter, between 18 and 19 bits of usable resolution, and a large number of aliasing products visible with high-level, high-frequency tones  .Ayres EX-8 2.0 Integrated Hub does handle low impedances more gracefully than the EX-8 and delivers its specified power into 4 ohms. Like its predecessor, its measured performance is dominated by the decision not to use loop negative feedback in its design. I was also puzzled by the somewhat different output impedances and distortion signatures of the two channels  . I cant help but wonder if this is due to current supply-chain problems, which could make it difficult to obtain optimally matched output devices  , as nonoptimal matching would be exacerbated by the absence of overall negative feedback. Footnote 1: See this YouTube video.Footnote 2: See my measurements here.Footnote 3: Following publication of the review, Ayre suspected that a solder joint for one of the output devices in the right channel had failed when the amplifier suffered a shock when it was sent to my place for the measurements. I will report on the measured performance of a second sample in the December 2021 issue.Footnote 4: This problem was examined in Re-Tales #11 and this YouTube video.          ',\n",
       " '  Dan DAgostino Momentum amplifier, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  .  , my usual procedure is to run it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. With a conventional amplifier using a class-A/B output stage, this level results in the maximum heat dissipation in the output devices. Unfortunately, after running at this level for 50 minutes, serial no.0265 turned itself off, with its heatsinks way too hot to keep my hand on. Those drop-dead-gorgeous, lacquered-copper heatsinks may not, therefore, be as efficient at dissipating heat as more conventional, finned heatsinks. I let the amplifier cool down, but it wouldnt power up again, although neither the 7.5A fuse on the rear panel, nor the fuse under the bottom-panel access plate, had blown. I therefore subjected the second sample, serial no.0266, to a shorter preconditioning time, 30 minutes. Even so, at the end of that time, my infrared thermometer indicated that the heatsinks were 119.6°F  , and the chassis a warm 105.2°F  . All measurements refer to this second sample.The Momentums voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 26.2dB, and the balanced input preserved absolute polarity, indicating that the XLR jack is wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance was usefully high, at 200k ohms in the midrange, dropping to 160k ohms at the frequency extremes. The output impedance was moderately high for a solid-state design, at 0.21 ohm at 20Hz and 2kHz, rising very slightly to 0.23 ohm at 20kHz.   The variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was a moderate ±0.2dB  . Fig.1 indicates that the Momentum has a wide small-signal bandwidth, the ultrasonic rolloff into 8 ohms   not reaching –3dB until 110kHz—though this is not quite as wide a bandwidth as the specified –1dB at 200kHz. Nevertheless, the Momentum reproduced a 10kHz squarewave   with very short risetimes and no hint of overshoot or ringing. The 1kHz squarewave was essentially perfect  .Fig.1 Dan DAgostino Momentum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Dan DAgostino Momentum, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Dan DAgostino Momentum, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms and taken with the input shorted, was a good 77.2dB, this improving to 78.1dB when the measurement was restricted to the audioband. Switching an A-weighting filter into circuit improved the S/N ratio to 81.65dB. With the amplifier driving a 1kHz tone into 8 ohms at 100W, the Momentums noise floor was disturbed by spuriae at the AC line frequency and its odd-order harmonics  , these spuriae most likely due to magnetic interference from the power transformer. Nevertheless, the spuriae all lie close to or below –100dB   and thus can be considered negligible.Fig.4 Dan DAgostino Momentum, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Specified as having a maximum power of 300W  , the Momentum comfortably exceeded that rating, clipping at 405W into 8 ohms  , with clipping defined as the point when the percentage of THD+noise in its output reaches 1%  . Fig.6 reveals that the amplifier clips at 640W into 4 ohms  , while into 2 ohms  , the amplifier puts out 1115W  . As with Dan DAgostinos earlier amplifier designs for Krell, the Momentum is a powerhouse!Fig.5 Dan DAgostino Momentum, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Dan DAgostino Momentum, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Dan DAgostino Momentum, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Figs.5, 6, and 7 also indicate that the Momentum offers very low distortion at lower powers, but that the THD plateaus at 0.06–0.08% at moderate powers. I therefore measured how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a level, 20V, where I could be sure I was looking at distortion rather than noise. The result is shown in  .8: THD+N remains constant with frequency below the top octave, though it does increase as the load impedance drops. However, there is very little rise in THD above 10kHz, suggesting that the Momentum has a commendably wide open-loop bandwidth.Fig.8 Dan DAgostino Momentum, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.9 indicates that the distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic, though there is a suspicious-looking spike in the residual waveform almost coincident with each zero-crossing point. This spike is the result of a picket fence of higher-order harmonics  , though its fair to note that these are all relatively low in level. I was a little puzzled, given the excellent high-frequency linearity seen in  .8, that the 1kHz difference tone resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 100W into 4 ohms   was moderately high in level, at –69dB  , with the spuriae at 18 and 21kHz at –74dB  . However, all other intermodulation products lay at or below –90dB  .Fig.9 Dan DAgostino Momentum, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 4 ohms, 0.084% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Dan DAgostino Momentum, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 100W into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Dan DAgostino Momentum, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .There are no surprises in the Dan DAgostino Momentums measured performance. This is an amplifier that is as well-engineered as it is beautiful to look at.           ',\n",
       " 'Though no larger than a paperback book, the PS Audio Sprout is a complex product, with USB, S/PDIF, and Bluetooth digital, analog line-level, and analog phono inputs, and speaker outputs, a headphone output, and a line-level output. Testing the Sprout was therefore more complicated than with a typical integrated amplifier.   Sprout using my recalibrated   system  . As the Sprout is a class-D amplifier—it uses an output module sourced from the Scandinavian Elan/Abletec company—it produces ultrasonic noise that would overload the Audio Precisions input circuitry. I therefore performed most of the tests using, ahead of the analyzer, an Audio Precision AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz.  Looking first at the PS Audio Sprout as a conventional integrated amplifier, and driving its line input, it offered a maximum voltage gain of 25.8dB into 8 ohms and preserved absolute polarity  . The input impedance was on the low side, at 8.25k ohms at high and middle frequencies, rising slightly to 9.4k ohms at the bottom of the audioband. The output impedance was extremely low, at 0.03–0.05 ohm, including 6 of speaker cable.As a result, the variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was negligible, nor was there any change in response as the load dropped from 8 to 2 ohms. However, note the 7.5dB peak centered on 67Hz in this graph. It appears that the Sprouts speaker outputs offer some compensation for the rolled-off low frequencies typical of small, inexpensive speakers, then quickly roll off the low bass to avoid overload. This equalization would work well with Herb Reicherts KEF and Totem speakers, but should have made his full-range Tekton Enzos sound too ripe. However, it is fair to note that he didnt comment on any such ripeness. Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum. Repeating the measurement with it set to 12 oclock gave a slightly lower bass peak but preserved the extended high-treble response. The curtailed low bass correlates with the sloped tops and bottoms of the waveform with a 1kHz squarewave  , and a slight overshoot is visible on the leading edges. However, looking at a 10kHz squarewave   reveals that this overshoot is not associated with any ringing.Fig.1 PS Audio Sprout, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 PS Audio Sprout, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 PS Audio Sprout, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was good rather than great, at 65dB in both directions at 1kHz, this decreasing to 40dB at 20kHz. With the Audio Precision low-pass filter in circuit, the Sprouts wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio was modest, at 57.3dB left and 55.2dB right, though restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband respectively improved these ratios to 64.9 and 61.4dB; A-weighting the measurement gave further improvement, to 80 and 82dB. Spectral analysis of the amplifiers low-frequency noise floor while it reproduced a 1kHz signal at 1W into 8 ohms   revealed that there was a regular series of power-supply–related spuriae in the Sprouts output, with the 60Hz component higher in the right channel than the left. But these spuriae are still sufficiently low not to be heard as hum.Fig.4 PS Audio Sprout, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Sprout is specified as having maximum power outputs of 33W into 8 ohms   and 50W into 4 ohms  . With clipping defined as the power when the THD+noise in the amplifiers output reaches 1%, the Sprout with both channels driven clipped at 32Wpc into 8 ohms   and 57Wpc into 4 ohms  . The downward slope of the traces in each of these graphs indicates that the Sprouts distortion actually lies beneath the noise up to 20W or so, and is very low.Fig.5 PS Audio Sprout, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 PS Audio Sprout, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Usually, I would have plotted how the percentage of THD+N varied with frequency at the voltage where the distortion started to rise above the noise floor. However, because the bass boost will reduce the Sprouts maximum output at low frequencies, I examined this at 3V output. Fig.7 reveals that the THD doesnt change with frequency other than in the very low bass, where the rise is actually associated with the response rolloff. At 1kHz, the distortion appears to be predominantly second harmonic  , though I had to average 64 captures to bring the distortion waveform out of the noise that would otherwise obscure it. I performed spectral analysis of the amplifiers output with a 50Hz tone into 4 ohms   at a lower power than usual, because the Sprouts protection circuit operated at higher continuous levels into this impedance. But again the second harmonic is the highest in level, though actually lower in level than the 120Hz supply-related tone.Fig.7 PS Audio Sprout, THD+N   vs frequency at 3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.8 PS Audio Sprout, 1kHz waveform at 7W into 8 ohms, 0.02% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 PS Audio Sprout, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Tested for intermodulation distortion with a 1kHz-spaced pair of high-frequency tones  , the Sprout produced a 1kHz difference tone at an acceptably low –63dB  , though the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were 12dB higher in level.Fig.10 PS Audio Sprout, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 4 ohms  .The headphone output  , again tested with a line-level input signal, offered a maximum gain of 12.4dB and, again, was non-inverting, as was the output at the line output.   The headphone output offered a very low source impedance of less than 1 ohm, while the line output jack offered 235 ohms.   These outputs, taken ahead of the main amplifiers class-D stage, behaved differently from the speaker outputs in the high treble and bass. Fig.11 shows the frequency response at the headphone output with the volume control set to its maximum   and to 12 oclock  . The response rolls off above the audioband, and has no boost in the midbass at the lower control setting, and only a hint of boost at the maximum setting. However, the low bass is still rolled off below 70Hz, which is perhaps why HR found the Sprout to sound dry and lean with headphones compared with his reference. Harmonic distortion from the headphone output was very low  , as was intermodulation distortion  .Fig.11 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, frequency response at 1V into 100k ohms with volume control set to maximum   and at 12 oclock    .Fig.12 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 2V into 300 ohms  .  Sprouts phono-stage performance at the headphone output, so it came as no surprise to find that the response with RIAA correction and the volume control set to its maximum was very similar to the line input response  . The ultrasonic rolloff occurs earlier, however, and is –1.5dB at 20kHz. But note the accuracy of the RIAA equalization and the very close matching between the two channels. The phono stage was again non-inverting, and the maximum gain for phono sources was 53.3dB at the headphone output and 66.7dB at the speaker outputs, these appropriate for moving-magnet cartridges. The input impedance was also compatible with MM cartridges, at 42k ohms at 2Hz, 45k ohms at 1kHz, and 37.5k ohms at 20kHz.Fig.13 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, phono input response with RIAA correction    .The low-frequency phono-overload margin was excellent, at 20dB at 20Hz  , though this will be associated with the rolled-off bass. The margin dropped to an adequate 11.4dB at 1kHz and 12.6dB at 20kHz. Distortion with a 1kHz tone at 5mV was low, with the second harmonic the highest in level at just –86dB  .Fig.14 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, phono input spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 5mV input  .Finally,  performance of the Sprouts D/A converter with both USB and S/PDIF data.   With the volume control set to its maximum, a –12dBFS signal at 1kHz gave rise to 10.03V at the speaker outputs, 2.14V at the headphone outputs. A full-scale digital signal would therefore clip both outputs with the volume control at its maximum; fortunately, the control will not be used at its maximum. Apples USB Prober utility identified the Sprout as \"XMOS USB 2.0 Audio Out,\" indicating that the USB receiver uses the popular XMOS device and that it operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode.The D/A section preserved absolute polarity, and its impulse response with 44.1kHz data   indicates that the digital reconstruction filter is a conventional FIR type. Wideband spectral analysis at the headphone output with 44.1kHz-sampled white noise   reveals that the filter has a fairly slow initial rolloff, which means that the ultrasonic image of a full-scale 19.1kHz tone at 25kHz is suppressed by 60dB rather than being buried in the stop-band noise floor. Both the USB and S/PDIF inputs locked to data of all sample rates from 44.1 to 192kHz. A more conventional look at the baseband frequency responses, with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz  , shows that the ultrasonic rolloff is identical with all three rates, other than a sharp drop just below each Nyquist frequency   for 44.1 and 96kHz data.Fig.15 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.16 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.17 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .The drop in the noise floor that occurred when feeding the digital inputs first with 16-and then 24-bit data, both representing a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , suggested that the Sprout offers about 17 bits of digital resolution for both USB and S/PDIF data. With an undithered tone at exactly –90.31dBFS, the Sprout successfully resolved the three DC voltage levels described by the digital data  . Feeding the Sprouts digital inputs with the Miller-Dunn J-Test signal gave the same result  : too high a noise floor, which completely obscures the odd-order harmonics of the low-frequency, LSB-level squarewave; and a regular series of sidebands of unknown origin, spaced at ±800, ±1600, ±2400Hz, etc.Fig.18 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.19 PS Audio Sprout, headphone output, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data from MacBook Pro via USB  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Though the Sprout didnt excel in any area of measured performance, it compensates for that with its affordable price and considerable flexibility. It really is a \"one-stop shop\" for putting together an inexpensive system.           ',\n",
       " '  Mark Levinson No.5805 integrated amplifier   than the one auditioned by Jim Austin  . There were some setup issues with this early sample—the firmware was version 1.36—but these were generally solved by rebooting.   Mark Levinson No.5805    , and before performing any testing, I ran the amplifier for an hour at one-third power into 8 ohms.   At the end of this time, the No.5805s top panel was quite warm, at 120.5°F  , and the internal heatsinks measured 133.7°F  . Commendably, this amplifier has enough heatsink capacity for sustained operation at high powers.Looking first at the line-level analog inputs: With the volume control at its maximum setting of \"80,\" the voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms measured 32.5dB from the speaker terminals for both balanced and unbalanced input signals and 8dB from both the preamplifier and headphone outputs, which is slightly but inconsequentially lower than the specified 8.5dB. The line inputs preserved absolute polarity   from all the outputs. The unbalanced input impedance was 16k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly to 13.5k ohms at 20kHz, while the balanced input impedance was 20k ohms across the audioband. The preamplifier output had a low output impedance of 52 ohms, this close to the specified 55 ohms, and the headphone output was a very low 2.8 ohms. Both values were consistent from 20Hz to 20kHz.The output impedance at the speaker terminals   was a little higher than specified, at 0.15 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.17 ohm at 20kHz. The modulation of the Mark Levinsons frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was just ±0.1dB  . The amplifiers output is down by 0.2dB at 20kHz and rolls off above the audioband, reaching –3dB at 60kHz. A 10kHz squarewave was therefore reproduced with short risetimes   and no overshoot or ringing. The excellent channel matching in  .1, taken with a balanced input and the volume control set to its maximum, was preserved at lower settings of the control. The ultrasonic response extended a little higher, reaching –3dB at 110kHz with the volume control set to \"60,\" which was equivalent to 19dB before full volume.Fig.1 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, volume control at max, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The No.5805s channel separation was excellent, at >90dB in both directions below 2kHz to 20kHz and still 74dB at 20kHz. With the line inputs shorted to ground, the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured 60.5dB  . Restricting the measurement bandwidth to 22kHz increased the ratio to 64.7dB, and an A-weighting filter increased the ratio to 67.9dB. These ratios were measured with the volume control set to its maximum, which is very much a worst case. Reducing the volume control to \"60\" increased the ratio by 14dB, which suggests the noise is being picked up by the circuitry before the volume control. Fig.3 shows the low-frequency spectrum of the No.5805s output while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms with the volume control set to \"80.\" The highest-level spuriae are at the AC power-line frequency of 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, presumably due to magnetic coupling from the power transformer.Fig.3 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Mark Levinson specifies the No.5805 as delivering a maximum power of 125Wpc into 8 ohms  . At our usual definition of clipping  , with continuous drive in both channels, the No.5805 exceeded that spec, delivering 133.5Wpc into 8 ohms  . With both channels driven into 4 ohms, the amplifier clipped at 210Wpc  , and into 2 ohms with one channel driven, it clipped at 370W  .Fig.4 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.5 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms, both channels driven.Fig.6 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms, one channel driven.The downward slope of the traces at levels below 50W or so in  s.4 and 5 implies that actual distortion lies beneath the noise floor, so I looked at how the No.5805s THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a level of 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The distortion levels were low in the bass and midrange in both channels into 8, 4, and 2 ohms  , and the usual rise at higher frequencies due to the circuits decreasing open-loop bandwidth was smaller than usual in the left channel   and nonexistent in the right  . The shape of the distortion-spuriae waveform in the right channel   suggests that the third harmonic was dominant at low powers, but the second harmonic was actually the highest in level around 4dB below the clipping power  . High-order intermodulation products resulting from an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms were low in level  , and the second-order difference product lay at just –77dB  .Fig.7 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, distortion   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.045% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Mark Levinson No.5805, line input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Turning to the No.5805s digital inputs, the optical S/PDIF inputs locked to datastreams with sample rates up to 96kHz, the coaxial input up to 192kHz. All digital inputs preserved absolute polarity. Apples USB Prober utility identified the No.5805 as \"No580x\" from \"HARMAN\" and confirmed that its USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. The AudioMIDI utility revealed that the USB port could handle 16- and 24-bit integer data at all sample rates up to 384kHz. With the volume control set to its maximum, a 1kHz digital signal at 0dBFS resulted in output levels of 5.6V at the preamp and headphone outputs. A signal at –12dBFS gave rise to 29.4V into 8 ohms at the speaker outputs, which is equivalent to 108W into 8 ohms. As is often the case with integrated amplifiers offering digital inputs, these have around 10dB too much gain compared with the line-level analog inputs. I continued testing the Mark Levinsons digital inputs from the preamplifier outputs with the power amplifier stage turned off using the menu.The No.5805 offers a choice between seven different reconstruction filters that can be set individually for each digital input: Apodizing Fast, Brickwall, Fast Linear, Fast Minimum, Hybrid Fast, Slow Linear, and Slow Minimum. Looking at each filters impulse response with 44.1kHz data indicates there are three—Apodizing Fast, Brickwall, and Fast Linear—that all have similar linear-phase time-domain behavior  . The Slow Linear filter was still linear-phase in nature but with a much lower amount of symmetrical ringing on either side of the single sample at 0dBFS  . The Fast Minimum filter was, as its name suggests, a minimum-phase type, with all the ringing following the single high sample  , while the Slow Minimum filter had less ringing  . The Hybrid Fast filter had a small amount of ringing before the high sample and more after  . In this respect, it appears identical to the Hybrid filter used in Pro-Jects Pre Box S2 Digital processor  , which I preferred when I auditioned that DAC.Fig.11 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Apodizing Fast filter, impulse response  .Fig.12 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Slow Linear filter, impulse response  .Fig.13 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Fast Minimum filter, impulse response  .Fig.14 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Slow Minimum filter, impulse response  .Fig.15 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Hybrid Fast filter, impulse response  .With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise, the Apodizing Fast, Brickwall, and Hybrid Fast filters all rolled off rapidly above the audioband, reaching full stop-band suppression at half the sample rate  . With the Fast Linear and Fast Minimum filters, full stop-band attenuation was reached at 24kHz, with the aliased image at 25kHz of a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz suppressed by almost 110dB  . The Slow Linear and Slow Minimum filters behaved similarly in the frequency domain, with a slow rolloff above 20kHz with 44.1kHz-sampled white noise   and the aliased 25kHz image   suppressed by 23dB. The harmonics of this tone, however, were all extremely low in level.Fig.16 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Hybrid Fast filter, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.17 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Hybrid Fast filter, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.18 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Slow Linear filter, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .The Mark Levinsons digital frequency response with the two Slow filters and with data sampled at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz follows the same basic shape at each sample rate, with a sharp rolloff above 17kHz with 44.1kHz data  . The response with 44.1kHz data with the Fast filters extended to 20kHz  . Channel separation for the digital inputs measured at the preamplifier outputs was superb, at 120dB at and below 1kHz. When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS  , the noise floor dropped by about 12dB in the top two audio octaves, meaning that the No.5805 offers around 18 bits worth of resolution in this region, though a little less in the bass and midrange. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS  , the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was symmetrical, though some HF noise was present. With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a slightly noisy sinewave  .Fig.19 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Slow Linear filter, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fig.20 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data  .Fig.21 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit TosLink data  .Fig.22 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit TosLink data  .Intermodulation distortion via the No.5805s digital inputs was extraordinarily low, the difference product at 1kHz with a full-scale mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones lying at –110dB  . This graph was taken with the Fast Linear filter. The 1kHz product was even lower in level with the Slow filters, but, as expected, the aliased images of the primary tones were only suppressed by 20dB or so  . When   digital inputs rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit J-Test data, the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were all at the correct levels  . However, three spurious tones can be seen, these having frequencies of 9.38kHz, 9.61kHz, and 9.89kHz. I have no idea where these tones arise from, and they were present with all digital inputs and with 24-bit data  . However, as they lie around –110dB, I doubt they will have audible consequences.Fig.23 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Fast Linear filter, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS peak  .Fig.24 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, Slow Linear filter, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS peak  .Fig.25 Mark Levinson No.5805, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit USB data  .

MM and MC phono inputs performance behavior, I floated the signal generators outputs and ran a separate ground connection from the binding post next to the amplifiers phono input RCAs, which gave the lowest level of noise. For the MC input, I set the appropriate DIP switch for each channel to its Ground position. With the volume control at its maximum setting, the MM inputs voltage gain at 1kHz measured 48.1dB from the preamplifier and headphone outputs and 74.5dB from the speaker outputs. The MCs gain, measured at the preamplifier outputs, was a very high 77.8dB. All three outputs preserved absolute polarity with both MM and MC phono input signals. The MM input impedance was 54k ohms at 20Hz, 49k ohms, and 41k ohms at 20kHz, these impedances appropriate for MM cartridges. With the MC inputs impedance set to 1000 ohms, I measured an impedance of 770 ohms. With it set to 37 ohms, which I understood to be Jim Austins preference, it measured exactly 37 ohms.The phono-stage RIAA error was very low in the treble and midrange, and precisely matched between channels, but featured a 0.6dB plateau in the bass  . With the phono inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to \"80,\" the MM inputs wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   measured a good 64dB in both channels. An A-weighting filter increased the ratios to an excellent 82.5dB. The MC inputs unweighted, wideband S/N ratios were even better, at 70dB in the left channel, 67.5dB in the right, both ref. 1kHz at 5007#181;V. These ratios increased to 82.8dB and 80.8dB, respectively. The No.5805s phono preamplifier inputs are very quiet.Fig.27 Mark Levinson No.5805, MM phono input, response with RIAA correction    .The MM inputs overload margins were good across the audioband at just over 17dB. However, and perhaps due to the MC inputs higher-than-usual gain, the overload margins for this input measured a low 7.6dB from 20Hz to 20kHz, which suggests that this input is optimized for low-output moving-coil cartridges. Both harmonic distortion   and intermodulation distortion  , measured with the MM input at +12dB ref. 1kHz at 5mV, were very low in level.Fig.28 Mark Levinson No.5805, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave at 20mV input, DC–10kHz  .Fig.29 Mark Levinson No.5805, MM phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 200mV peak  . Overall, Mark Levinsons No.5805 offers excellent measured performance. Footnote 1: See  .6 here.          ',\n",
       " '  Parasound Halo Integrated    . As usual,   amplifier before measuring it by running both channels at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that period, the top panel was hot, reaching 137.4°F   by the vents over the internal heatsinks.I began by looking at the Halos phono-stage performance, taking the amplifiers output from the fixed-level Rec Out jacks with the volume control at its minimum setting, so that the high-level tests wouldnt overload the power-amplifier stage. With the phono input set to moving magnet, the voltage gain was 34.2dB; set to moving coil, it was 53.8dB. Each value is appropriate for that type of phono cartridge. Measured at the speaker outputs with the volume control at its maximum setting, these phono-stage gains were 64 and 94dB, respectively. Both settings inverted absolute polarity. Set to 47k ohms, the input impedance was 47k ohms at 20Hz, 44.5k ohms at 1kHz, and 38k ohms at 20kHz; with this setting at 100 ohms, the input impedance measured 100 ohms at all audio frequencies.The RIAA response error was respectably low  , especially in the left channel  , but both channels can be seen to apply the so-called \"Neumann fourth pole,\" resulting in an output that is up 9dB at 100kHz. While some justify this modification to the RIAA curve on theoretical grounds, I dont like to see it because it boosts the ultrasonic content of unequalized signals such as record ticks and clicks. Channel separation was high, at >70dB above 1kHz, and the signal/noise ratio, measured with the inputs shorted and a 22Hz–22kHz bandwidth, was good, at 69.8dB   and 54dB  . A-weighting respectively increased these ratios to 69.9 and 61dB.Fig.1 Parasound Halo Integrated, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .The Halos phono stage was extremely linear. Even with a 1kHz signal at 20mV, the MM setting produced just a tiny amount of second-harmonic distortion  ; and with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at the same equivalent level, there was a negligible amount of intermodulation distortion  . Correlating with this excellent linearity, the phono-stage overload margin was also excellent, at around 25dB across the audioband at both MM and MC settings.Fig.2 Parasound Halo Integrated, phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1V into 100k ohms  .Fig.3 Parasound Halo Integrated, phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1V peak into 100k ohms  .Turning to the digital inputs, again I assessed their performance at the fixed output jacks. Using my MacBook Pro on battery power to look at the USB input, this operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode, and the Halo was identified as \"PARASOUND—Digital Audio\" with the manufacturer string \"VIA Technologies Inc.\" The USB input accepted sample rates up to 384kHz, plus, unusually, 705.6kHz, and integer bit depths up to 32. The TosLink input accepted data with a 192kHz sample rate, which is commendable. All digital inputs preserved absolute polarity  .A full-scale tone at 1kHz resulted in an analog output of 1.92V at the fixed output. Because a tone at –20dBFS with the volume control at its maximum setting produced 18.7V at the speaker outputs, measured into 8 ohms, the digital inputs shouldnt be used with the volume control above 3:00 or so. The reconstruction filters impulse response is shown in  .3; the filter is a conventional, finite-impulse-response type with a response that rolls off rapidly above 21kHz with 44.1kHz-sampled data  . With a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz  , the third harmonic lies at –86dB  , suggesting that the digital circuitry offers low levels of harmonic distortion. This was confirmed by other tests  . Fig.7 shows the Halos digital-input frequency response with sample rates of 44.1, 96, and 192kHz via the TosLink input, and 384kHz via the USB input. The ultrasonic output conforms to the same gentle rolloff, but rolls off sharply just below each Nyquist frequency   at the three lower rates. At the 384kHz rate the smooth rolloff continues, reaching –18.5dB at 190kHz.Fig.4 Parasound Halo Integrated, digital input, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.5 Parasound Halo Integrated, digital input, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.6 Parasound Halo Integrated, digital input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 0dBFS into 100k ohms  .Fig.7 Parasound Halo Integrated, digital input, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz  , 384kHz    .Channel separation via the digital inputs was good, at >95dB in both directions below 7kHz. Feeding the Halo data representing a 1kHz tone with first 16-bit data  , then 24-bit data  , showed that the increase in bit depth dropped the noise floor by almost 20dB, which suggests that the Halo has better than 19-bit resolution. Repeating these measurements with USB data gave the same result, indicating that the Halos USB input correctly handles 24-bit data. While many very low-level, power-supply–related spuriae can be seen in  .8, these didnt affect the Halos accurate reproduction of undithered 16-bit and 24-bit tones at exactly –90.31dBFS  .Fig.8 Parasound Halo Integrated, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.9 Parasound Halo Integrated, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.10 Parasound Halo Integrated, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Intermodulation distortion via the digital input was negligible  , as were any jitter-related artifacts with both 16- and 24-bit J-Test data  .Fig.11 Parasound Halo Integrated, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Parasound Halo Integrated, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 24-bit data from SYS2722 via TosLink  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.Turning to the Halos behavior via its line inputs and measured at the speaker outputs, the maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was 39.6dB into 8 ohms via the balanced jacks, and 39.7dB via the unbalanced jacks. The balanced input impedance was 40k ohms across the audioband, and the unbalanced impedance was 24k ohms, again across the audioband. While the balanced input preserved absolute polarity, the unbalanced inputs were inverting.The output impedance was very low, at 0.09 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz  , rising slightly to 0.11 ohm at 20kHz. The modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction between this output impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore very small  . This graph indicates that the Halo has a wide bandwidth, the response into 8 ohms reaching –3dB at 100kHz. As a result, the Parasounds reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was excellent  , with short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing. The traces in  .13 were taken with the volume control at its maximum setting. Repeating the measurements at lower settings preserved both the close channel matching and the wide bandwidth.Fig.13 Parasound Halo Integrated, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.14 Parasound Halo Integrated, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.There was an audible 0.36dB insertion loss at 1kHz when the tone controls, set to their central, detented positions, were switched into circuit. Fig.15 shows the effect of the treble and bass controls set to their maximum and minimum settings; these are very similar in behavior to the controls of Parasounds Halo P 5 preamplifier, which Art Dudley reviewed in April 2014. The behavior of the Halo Integrateds subwoofer and crossover controls also look very similar to the P 5s.Fig.15 Parasound Halo Integrated, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with tone controls set to: flat  , and maximum and minimum positions  .Channel separation at 1kHz was good rather than great, at 70dB, decreasing to 50dB at the top of the audioband. The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, measured with the inputs shorted but the volume control at its maximum setting, was good, at 73dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms. This improved to 78dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 82.5dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis revealed that AC supply components were at a low level  .Fig.16 Parasound Halo Integrated, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1V into 100k ohms  .Figs. 17 and 18 plot the percentage of THD+noise in the Halos output as it drove 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. These graphs show that the Parasound met its specified power of 160Wpc into 8 ohms   and 270Wpc into 4 ohms   at 1% THD+N. Fig.19 plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at a fairly high level: 20V, equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. Fig.19 also shows that the amplifier offers low levels of distortion into the two higher impedances, but begins to stress out into 2 ohms.   The distortion signature is strongly third-harmonic in nature  , and intermodulation is also very low, even at high powers  .Fig.17 Parasound Halo Integrated, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.18 Parasound Halo Integrated, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.19 Parasound Halo Integrated, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.20 Parasound Halo Integrated, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.012% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.21 Parasound Halo Integrated, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.22 Parasound Halo Integrated, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  .The headphone output preserved absolute polarity, and was sourced from a 10 ohm impedance.Like other Halo-series components from Parasound we have reviewed, the Integrated is a well-engineered, well-performing product.

       " '  Karan POWERa Mono amplifiers that JVS auditioned, serial number 005. Because the amplifier was too wide to fit through the door from my listening room to the corridor that leads to the test lab, I performed the measurements in my listening room. To ensure that this very powerful amplifier wasnt starved of wall current, I ran two long, heavy-duty extension cords to the Karan from the 20A circuit in the test lab.   amplifier  , plugged into one of the extension cords. Following distributor Wynn Wongs recommendation, I performed the measurements with the DC filter on the amplifiers rear panel switched on; however, I didnt measure any differences with this filter on or off.   Other than voltage gain, polarity, and input impedance, all the measurements were performed using the balanced input. When testing the single-ended input, I followed the manuals recommendation of shorting pins 1 and 3 of the XLR jack.Out of its crate, the amplifier was ice-cold from its air trip from Washington State, so I ran the Karan at a few watts into 8 ohms for two hours before examining its measured performance. I then followed the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power of 2.1kW   into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the ventilation holes on the top panel over the internal heatsinks were very hot, at 124.4°F  . The side panels were even hotter, at 144.6°F  . However, when I repeated some of the tests the next day without the preconditioning, I noted that amplifier ran very cool to the touch even after driving 1W into 8 ohms for an hour.The POWERa Monos voltage gain was 34.7dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs, which is higher than usual. The Karan preserved absolute polarity   with both input types.   The specified input impedance is 30k ohms for both input types. I measured 29.6k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz for the balanced input, half that value for the unbalanced input.Fig.1 Karan POWERa Mono, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Karan POWERa Mono, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Karans output impedance was 0.5 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz increasing to 0.67 ohm at 20kHz.   These impedances are higher than I expected from a solid state design, presumably because the output comprises two amplifier stages in series, a topology used to obtain the POWERas very high specified power. The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was ±0.25dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB at 81kHz, a lower frequency than the specified –3dB at 300kHz. The increased output impedance at 20kHz means that the –3dB frequency was somewhat lower into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms  . However, the POWERa Monos reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   was superb, with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.3 Karan POWERa Mono, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Measured with either the unbalanced input or the balanced input shorted to ground, the Karan amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was a very good 71.8dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 79dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 81.3dB when A-weighted. While even-order harmonics of the 60Hz power-supply frequency were present in the Karans noisefloor  , these were very low in level, at –94dB and below ref. 1W into 8 ohms.Fig.4 Karan POWERa Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Karan POWERa Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.When   POWERa Monos maximum power into 8 ohms, the THD+noise reached 1%   at 1.85kW into 8 ohms  . While this is lower than the specified 2.1kW into this load  , the AC wall voltage had dropped from 120.6V with the amplifier idling to 114.5V with the amplifier clipping. The Karans maximum power into 4 ohms is specified as 3.6kW  . I measured 2.5kW into 4 ohms at 1% THD+N  . Again, the wall voltage had dropped by several volts at the clipping power  . I didnt test the maximum power into 2 ohms because this would have tripped the wall supplys circuit breaker.)Fig.6 Karan POWERa Mono, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.67V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Figs.4 & 5 indicate that actual distortion lies beneath the noisefloor below 1W, rising to a maximum around 20W then dropping again, reaching a minimum value just before actual waveform clipping. I therefore examined how the percentage of THD+N changed with frequency at 12.67V, which is equivalent to 20W into 8 ohms, 40W into 4 ohms, and 80W into 2 ohms  . The distortion remained below 0.1% into all three impedances and was lowest in level at low frequencies into 2 ohms  . Commendably, the distortion doesnt rise at high frequencies.Fig.7 Karan POWERa Mono, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.051% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Karan POWERa Mono, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 200W into 4 ohms  .I was having some issues with my digital oscilloscope at very high sample rates, so  .7 shows my analog oscilloscopes screen with the POWERa Mono driving 1kHz at 100W into 8 ohms. This photo reveals that the distortion at high powers occurs at the waveforms zero-crossing points. This will be due to the output stage lacking sufficient bias at this power, perhaps as a result of the sliding bias mechanism. While the third harmonic is the highest in level, at –66dB  , the crossover distortion is, as always, accompanied by higher odd-order harmonics.Fig.9 Karan POWERa Mono, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .When the POWERa Mono drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 100W into 8 ohms  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at a very low –106dB  , though higher-order intermodulation products are higher in level. These products dropped by around 3dB at the same peak voltage level into 4 ohms.The Karan POWERa Mono amplifiers measured behavior reveals that it copes well with low impedance and offers extremely high power, though the level of distortion at moderately high powers was not as low as I was expecting. Footnote 1: Observant folks will notice that even though its below the amplifiers specified maximum power, 2.5kW is more power than a single 120V, 20A service should be able to supply. But the Audio Precisions procedure raises the input voltage quickly before terminating the input signal the moment the distortion reaches a pre-established target, in this case 3%. It takes a while for a circuit breaker to trip, so presumably, the current from the wall exceeded 20A momentarily—too briefly to trip the breaker.—Jim Austin          ',\n",
       " '  Siltech SAGA    . When I received from Michael Fremer the Siltech SAGA V1 voltage amplifier and P1 current amplifier, I hoisted the two chassis up onto my test bench—easier to write than to do, given that each weighs 53 lbs—and linked them with a pair of XLR interconnects. Although the SAGAs XLR jacks are wired for single-ended operation, with pins 1 and 3 shorted, Siltech recommends using cables fitted with XLRs, presumably due to the fact that these, when plugged in, make the ground connection before the signal connection, thus avoiding potentially damaging pulses. I plugged the V1s charger into the wall, made sure the V1s batteries were charged, then turned both units on—only to run into a problem.I was getting signal from only the left pair of speaker terminals. This was the case whether I ran the V1 voltage amplifier in pentode or triode modes. I replaced the cables, with no change. I then swapped cables from left to right for both the input from the signal generator and for the links joining the chassis, fed signal directly to the P1 current amplifier, then looked at the V1s outputs. It became apparent that the fault was with the V1s right channel; presumably, something untoward had happened when Michael Fremer shipped the SAGA components to me for measurement. As the left channel of this sample, serial number 02, appeared to be working correctly, according to the published specifications, I continued, measuring only that channel.  on an amplifier, I usually run it for an hour at one-third its specified maximum power into 8 ohms, which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. Although Siltech claims for the SAGA a maximum output of 380Wpc into 8 ohms, both Paul Millers measurements in the June 2013 issue of British magazine Hi-Fi News and my own measurement of this sample suggest that 300Wpc is more typical. I therefore set the single channel driving 100W into 8 ohms, and sat back to wait for the hours preconditioning to conclude.  But after only 10 minutes, the P1 turned itself off. I turned it back on, but the P1s mute wouldnt lift. The P1s heatsinks are internal; the top panel was warm to the touch, at 105.4°F  , but according to the manual, the muting meant that the amplifier had overheated, and that it would not operate again until it had cooled down. After it had done so, I continued measuring.The SAGA combinations voltage gain, measured into 8 ohms, depended on the V1s tube mode. It was a high 33.4dB in pentode mode, but almost 6dB lower, at 27.7dB, in triode mode—both close to the specified  ures. The P1 alone attenuated input signals by 0.4dB. The SAGA amplifier as a whole inverted signal polarity in both modes, though the P1 alone preserved absolute polarity  , as you would expect from a voltage-follower circuit.The V1s input impedance was extremely high in both triode and pentode modes at low and middle frequencies, at 500k ohms or so.   It dropped at 20kHz to 140k ohms in triode and 76k ohms in pentode, but these  ures are still sufficiently high that the V1 wont load the preamplifier in use to any significant extent. The P1s input impedance was also very high, at almost 200k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, but dropped again to 76k ohms at 20kHz.The P1s output impedance was higher than is usual for a solid-state design, at 0.23 ohm, which resulted in a mild, ±0.13dB modulation of the systems frequency response in both pentode   and triode   modes. However, this variation is superimposed on a raised treble plateau that reaches +0.13dB in triode and +0.4dB in pentode. Although this high-frequency lift is small, it covers a sufficiently wide frequency range that it should be audible, at least in pentode mode. Note also that the complete SAGA has a wider ultrasonic response in triode mode than in pentode, especially into 8 ohms  —an even wider bandwidth than the P1 alone  . The P1s response is flat within the audioband, meaning that the treble plateau in the system response comes from the V1. This leads to a small amount of leading-edge overshoot in the shape of a 10kHz squarewave  .Fig.1 Siltech SAGA, original sample, V1 in pentode mode, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Siltech SAGA, original sample, V1 in triode mode, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.3 Siltech SAGA, original sample, P1 alone, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms    .Fig.4 Siltech SAGA, original sample, V1 in triode mode, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Siltechs rationale for splitting the power amplifier into separate voltage- and current-amplifier chassis is that this minimizes noise. They specify very high signal/noise ratios: 128dB for the V1 in triode, 138dB for the P1, both measurements IHF-A. I couldnt measure ratios this high for the SAGA as a whole, though that may have been because my S/N reference is 2.83V, which is the voltage-output equivalent of 1W into 8 ohms. With the V1s input shorted, the SAGAs wideband, unweighted S/N was 70.8dB in pentode, 78.8dB in triode. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband respectively increased these ratios to 79.2 and 97.1dB, while A-weighting further increased them to 81.8 and 101.6dB. If Siltechs ratio is referred to maximum power rather than 1W, the latter ratios get very close to the specified 128dB.Fig.5 compares the low-frequency spectrum of the SAGAs noise floor when the V1s input is shorted   with the spectrum when the entire SAGA, in triode mode, drives a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms  . Spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics appear with the amplifier passing signal, with 60Hz the highest in level, at –80dB  . Repeating the spectral analysis with the P1 alone revealed that the P1 is much quieter than the V1, with power-line harmonics 30dB lower than with the P1 driven by the V1.Fig.5 Siltech SAGA, original sample, V1 in triode mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  , and with V1 input shorted    .Siltechs specifications for the SAGA reveal a higher-than-usual amount of harmonic distortion, but my measurements were much worse than those specs. Concerned that this sample of the P1, serial no.12, may have been faulty, I discussed my measurements with Siltechs Edwin Rynveld. It turned out that our sample of the P1 was from the first production run, and that a part used in the P1s optical Apollo circuit had suffered a 100% failure rate in the field. It worked correctly when first operated, so that the amplifier would pass testing in manufacturing, but over time it would slowly fail, starving the P1s output stage of bias current. Ultimately, without any bias, the P1 would be operating in class-B, hence the very high levels of distortion that I measured, with the residual distortion waveform featuring high levels of crossover distortion  .Fig.6 Siltech SAGA, original sample, V1 in pentode mode, 1kHz waveform at 8W into 4 ohms, 0.271% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Given the failure of both the V1 and P1 samples on the test bench, I arranged to have them shipped back to Siltech and requested new samples. When these arrived, I set them up on the test bench. The distortion of the new sample of the P1   was very much lower than the original sample  , suggesting that the revised biasing scheme was working correctly. To ensure that everything was working correctly, I left the amplifier operating at a level of 2W into 8 ohms. However, after 20 minutes the amplifier turned itself off, apparently due to overheating. There had been no indication of instability, but the temperature of the bottom of the chassis was 104.7°F  , and the internal heatsinks were presumably much hotter.I let the P1 cool down before turning it on again. However, after 10 minutes at 1W into 8 ohms, an internal relay starting clicking, the output waveform was clipped even at this low signal level, and the P1s chassis was again very hot. Obviously, something had gone wrong with this sample, too.I returned the V1 and P1 to Siltech and awaited new samples. When these arrived—the V1 was serial no.16; the P1 was the original sample, serial no.12, repaired and updated with the new optical part—I performed a full set of tests before driving them over to Michael Fremers, so he could redo his auditioning.The voltage gains, input and output impedances, frequency responses, channel separations, and S/N ratios of these samples were all very similar to the earlier ones, indicating manufacturing consistency. However, when I attempted to precondition the SAGA by running the combination with a 1kHz signal at a lower level than before, 20Wpc into 8 ohms, the P1 turned itself off after 25 minutes. Its top panel was hot, at 120.2°F  . This time, however, after cooling down, the P1 continued to operate with no further problems, and I could continue testing.The SAGA in pentode mode now offered respectably low distortion. Figs. 7 and 8 respectively plot the percentage of THD+noise against output power into 8 and 4 ohms in pentode mode. The combination reaches 1% THD+N at 350Wpc into 8 ohms   and 580Wpc into 4 ohms  , with the specified 8-ohm power of 380W   reached at just under 2% THD+N. The distortion remains below 0.1% at powers of less than 15W into 8 ohms and of 25W into 4 ohms. In triode mode, the maximum power was lower, as expected, with the 1% THD+N percentage reached at 88Wpc into 8 ohms   and 170Wpc into 4 ohms  . Though respectably low below 1W into either load, the distortion rose linearly with power, due to the somewhat bent transfer function of the V1s triode circuit.Fig.7 Siltech SAGA, final sample, V1 in pentode mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.8 Siltech SAGA, final sample, V1 in pentode mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.9 Siltech SAGA, final sample, V1 in triode mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.10 Siltech SAGA, final sample, V1 in triode mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.11 plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at 11V in pentode mode, which is equivalent to 15W into 8 ohms. The distortion behavior is somewhat different in the two channels, with the left channel   looking more linear than the right  , even into 2 ohms  . This imbalance appeared to occur in the P1, as the spectrum of the V1s output in pentode mode when outputting 50Hz at 2.83V into 100k ohms   revealed identical behavior in the V1s two channels, the only significant distortion harmonic being the second, at –67dB  . Repeating the analysis at the same output level but with the V1 in triode mode   again showed the two channels as identical, but with the second harmonic now at –60dB  . Looking at the P1s behavior on this test at 15Wpc into 8 ohms  , the third harmonic is now the dominant distortion component, at –71dB  , but the even-order harmonics can be seen to be different in the two channels, confirming that it is the P1 in which this linearity imbalance occurs.Fig.11 Siltech SAGA, final sample, V1 in pentode mode, THD+N  vs frequency at 11V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.12 Siltech SAGA, final sample, V1 alone in pentode mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2.83V into 100k ohms  .Fig.13 Siltech SAGA, final sample, V1 alone in triode mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2.83V into 100k ohms  .Fig.14 Siltech SAGA, final sample, P1 alone, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 15W into 8 ohms  .Finally, while the original SAGAs behavior on the high-frequency intermodulation test was very disappointing in both triode and pentode modes, the new sample was very much better. Fig.14 shows the spectrum of the P1s output while it reproduced an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 10W into 8 ohms. All the intermodulation products lie at or below –81dB  , though the difference tone at 1kHz is higher in the left channel   than the right  .Fig.15 Siltech SAGA, final sample, P1 alone, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms  .Assuming that these latest samples are representative of current production, the Siltech SAGAs measured performance is still somewhat idiosyncratic. The V1 offers the user the choice between two different distortion signatures, while the P1 offers very high dynamic range, provided the high power is not sustained for very long. All I can say is that this unusual and expensive amplifier must be auditioned with the prospective owners own speakers to determine if its sonic signature will be optimal.           ',\n",
       " '  Rogue Audio Sphinx using my top-of-the-line   system  .   the Sphinx for an hour at one-third its specified maximum power of 100Wpc into 8 ohms. Thermally, this is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage, but its irrelevant with an efficient class-D amplifier like the Rogue, which uses the well-regarded Hypex modules. By the end of that period the Sphinxs chassis was only mildly warm, but at least I could be confident that the circuits were all nicely toasted for testing.Looking first at the line inputs, the maximum gain into 8 ohms was 31.16dB, with excellent matching of the two channels. The Sphinx preserved absolute polarity  , and its input impedance was usefully high, at well above 100k ohms at almost all audio frequencies, and still 103k ohms at 20kHz. The output impedance was very low for a class-D design, at around 0.02 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz  , rising slightly to 0.11 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the variation in frequency response with the Sphinx driving our standard simulated loudspeaker   was negligible. Unusually for a class-D design, the Rogues ultrasonic rolloff was identical into loads ranging from 2 to 8 ohms. There is usually a passive low-pass filter between the class-D output stage and the speaker terminals to reduce the level of ultrasonic switching noise, and this filter will misbehave into loads other than the one it was optimized for. The Sphinx offered no such misbehavior.Fig.1 Rogue Sphinx, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Present in the Rogues output, however, was around 225mV of ultrasonic noise with a center frequency of 415.5kHz in the left channel and 418.5kHz in the right. This can be graphically seen in the waveform of a 10kHz squarewave  . For all the measurements other than this one, I used a precision passive low-pass filter from Audio Precision to eliminate noise above 200kHz that would otherwise contaminate the analyzers reading. Repeating the squarewave measurement with this filter gave the waveform shown in  .3—the risetimes are slowed by the amount you would expect from the response in  .1, and though there is a small degree of overshoot on the waveforms leading edges, this is critically damped, with no ringing.Fig.2 Rogue Sphinx, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Rogue Sphinx, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms with Audio Precision low-pass filter.Channel separation   was good rather than great, at 60dB in both directions below 1kHz, and around 40dB at the top of the audioband. The unweighted signal/noise ratio in the audioband, taken with the input shorted but the volume control at its maximum, was moderately good, at 67.2dB left and 63.3dB right. This was primarily due to full-wave–rectified, supply-related spuriae, which were a little higher in the right channel  . I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the analyzer; this was the spectrum I took with the optimal arrangement.Fig.4 Rogue Sphinx, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with Audio Precision low-pass filter  .The Sphinx precisely met its specification of maximum power into 8 ohms: 100Wpc, or 20dBW at 1% THD+noise  , with very low distortion between 1 and 20W. Into 4 ohms, the amplifier clipped at 155Wpc or 18.9dBW  , but with a little higher distortion at lower powers. Plotting the THD+N percentage at 8.7V into 8 and 4 ohms  , a voltage where I could be sure I was looking at actual distortion rather than noise, indicated that the left channel   was a little more linear than the right  . Neither channel changed its behavior with frequency, other than above 10kHz, where I assume the limited ultrasonic bandwidth is affecting the result.Fig.5 Rogue Sphinx, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms with Audio Precision low-pass filter.Fig.6 Rogue Sphinx, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms with Audio Precision low-pass filter.Fig.7 Rogue Sphinx, THD+N   vs frequency with Audio Precision low-pass filter at 8.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion result is heavily second-harmonic in nature, though there must be higher-order products present into lower impedances, giving rise to low-level peaks that are slightly displaced in time from the waveforms zero crossings  . This can also be seen in  .9, which shows the spectrum of the Sphinxs output with a 50Hz tone driven at 40% power into 4 ohms. However, intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at the same power into 4 ohms is respectably low  . The second-order product at 1kHz lies at –64dB  .Fig.8 Rogue Sphinx, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms with Audio Precision low-pass filter, 0.058% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Rogue Sphinx, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave with Audio Precision low-pass filter, DC–1kHz, at 60W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Rogue Sphinx, HF intermodulation spectrum with Audio Precision low-pass filter, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 60W peak into 4 ohms  .  phono input at the fixed-output jacks with the volume control set to its minimum so that I could keep the output stage quiescent. These outputs operate at unity gain for line-level inputs; for the phono input I measured a voltage gain of 37.7dB, which is appropriate for moving-magnet cartridges and high-output moving-coils. The input preserved absolute polarity, and the input impedance was 41k ohms at 20Hz and 20kHz, rising slightly to 46k ohms at 1kHz. Again, these  ures are appropriate for MMs and high-output MCs.The RIAA correction was superbly accurate for what must be a relatively inexpensive circuit, with very little error and the two channels matching to within 0.1dB  . The bass rolls off early, conforming to the IEC modification of the RIAA specification and reaching –3dB at 11Hz. Channel separation via the phono input was excellent, at 80dB in both directions at 1kHz. The phono inputs noise performance was also excellent, with unweighted audioband signal/noise ratios   of 77.3dB left and 79.8dB right. The ratios improved by 6dB when A-weighted.Fig.11 Rogue Sphinx, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .With its relatively low gain, the Sphinxs phono input offered superb overload margins, ranging from 30.6dB at 20Hz to 28.7dB at 1kHz, and still 21.7dB at 20kHz. Distortion at typical recorded levels was very low, at <0.005% at all frequencies, and all that can be seen in the spectrum of a 1kHz signal at 5mV input are some low-level, supply-related spuriae  . Intermodulation distortion via the phono input   was also superbly low, the 1kHz difference component lying at –86dB  .Fig.12 Rogue Sphinx, phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 384mV   into 100k ohms  .Fig.13 Rogue Sphinx, phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 2V peak into 100k ohms  .Even without taking into account its affordable price, Rogue Audios Sphinx offers excellent measured performance with little sign of the usual compromises made in class-D designs. It also has an excellent, moving-magnet–compatible phono stage.           ',\n",
       " '  McIntosh MC275, I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. The MC275 has four output terminals for each channel, one labeled \"Common,\" the others \"4,\" \"8,\" and \"16.\" I performed a complete set of measurements from each output transformer tap using the balanced inputs, and repeated some of the tests using the unbalanced input jacks.With balanced drive, the voltage gain into 8 ohms was on the low side, at 17.2dB from the 4 ohm tap, 20.5dB from the 8 ohm tap, and 22.7dB from the 16 ohm tap. The unbalanced gains, unusually, were all exactly 6dB higher than the balanced, presumably because of the extra tube stage in this mode. Both balanced and unbalanced inputs preserved absolute polarity   from all three output taps.   The input impedance at the RCA jacks was a high 86k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 62k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedances were all twice these  ures, as specified.The McIntoshs output impedances were on the low side for a transformer-coupled tube design, at 0.33 ohm from the 4 ohm tap, 0.57 ohm from the 8 ohm tap, and 0.87 ohm from the 16 ohm tap. These  ures applied at low and midrange frequencies; the impedance at 20kHz was a little higher, at 0.38 ohm  , 0.7 ohm  , and 1.1 ohms  . Even so, the modification of the McIntoshs frequency response due to the interaction between this source impedance and the impedance modulus of the loudspeaker was relatively mild. The gray trace in  .1, for example, shows the response with the MC275s 8 ohm tap driving our standard simulated loudspeaker. The variations remain within ±0.5dB limits. The limits were ±0.25dB from the 4 ohm tap   and ±0.7dB from the 16 ohm tap  . Note the slight, 0.12dB channel imbalance in this graph, which persisted from all taps into all loads. The McIntosh has wide bandwidth, its high-frequency response into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm tap not reaching –3dB until 91kHz. Its reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave, therefore, was superbly square  , the flat tops of the waveform confirming the excellent low-frequency extension. The 10kHz squarewave was also superb well shaped  , with no ringing or overshoot visible. Those big output transformers are obviously of high quality.Fig.1 McIntosh MC275, 8 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 McIntosh MC275, 8 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.3 McIntosh MC275, 8 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.4 McIntosh MC275, 4 ohm tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.5 McIntosh MC275, 4 ohm output tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was better than 90dB below 1kHz, R–L, and better than 112dB in the other direction, which is excellent. The MC275 was also very quiet, with unweighted wideband signal/noise ratios   of 89dB left and 88dB right, which are superb, if partly the result of the lowish gain in balanced mode. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these respective ratios to 96.5 and 93.5dB, while A-weighting the measurements gave 100.2 and 101dB. Its hard to believe that this amplifier was designed in 1961!Figs.6, 7, and 8 plot the THD+noise percentage against output power from the 4, 8, and 16 ohm output-transformer taps, respectively. With each taps nominal value matched to the load, the McIntosh amplifier more than meets its specified output power of 75Wpc  , with 90Wpc available from the 4 ohm tap at clipping into 4 ohms  , 85Wpc available from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms  , and 92Wpc from the 16 ohm tap into 16 ohms  .   These graphs show that the distortion remains well below 0.1% as long as the nominal tap value is equal to or less than the load impedance.   But when the load impedance is significantly below the tap value, the distortion quickly rises above 0.1%, even at low powers. So even though the 16 ohm tap offers the highest gain, there will be very few loudspeakers that this tap will drive in a completely linear manner.Fig.6 McIntosh MC275, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 16, 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.7 McIntosh MC275, 8 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 16, 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.8 McIntosh MC275, 16 ohm output tap, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 16, 8, 4 ohms.The traces in these last three graphs were taken at 1kHz. However, the MC275 is actually at its most linear in the lower midrange, as revealed by  s.9 and 10, the plots of the THD+N percentage against frequency at 2.83V from the 4 and 8 ohm taps, respectively. With the 4 ohm tap driving 16 ohms, for example, the THD+N is a superbly low 0.004% at 280Hz. The distortion does rise a little at lower frequencies, presumably due to the output transformers core starting to saturate; and at high frequencies, due to the circuits decreasing gain-bandwidth product—but this is still a very linear design, as long as the load is equal to or greater than the nominal tap value.Fig.9 McIntosh MC275, 4 ohm output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.10 McIntosh MC275, 8 ohm output tap, THD+N  vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .In the midrange, the predominant distortion present in the amplifiers output is the second harmonic  , which is subjectively benign even at much higher levels than offered by the MC275. At low frequencies and higher powers, the third harmonic is equal to the second in strength in the right channel  , and a regular series of higher harmonics can be seen. Finally, the MC275s reduced top-octave linearity seen in  s.9 and 10 results in a regular series of intermodulation products appearing when the amplifier is asked to drive an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a moderately high power level  . Even so, the second-order or difference product at 1kHz, the highest-level spurious tone, lay at –64dB  , which is still fairly low in absolute terms.Fig.11 McIntosh MC275, 8 ohm output tap, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  , 0.05% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 McIntosh MC275, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 14W into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 McIntosh MC275, 4 ohm output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 24W peak into 4 ohms  .As I said, it is difficult to believe from its measured performance that the McIntosh MC275 was designed almost half a century ago  . Good audio engineering is timeless.

       " '  Devialet Expert 140 Pro    . The amplifier as received was set to \"High Pass 10Hz, Max. Level 2.0V.\" I usually precondition amplifiers by running them at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour, which is thermally the worst case for a class-AB output stage. As the Devialet has a   digital output stage, the preconditioning wasnt necessary. Nevertheless, the amplifier ran warm, with the top panel measuring 119.9°F   an hour or so into the testing. The menus internal temperature function indicated the message \"Temp. A Amp 61°C; Temp. D Amp 57°C; Temp. Supply 65°C.\" The Expert 140 Pro should be positioned where it is well-ventilated.As I always do with class-D amplifiers, I inserted an Audio Precision auxiliary AUX-0025 passive low-pass filter, which eliminates noise above 200kHz, between the test load. This eliminates the risk of driving the analyzers input stage into slew-rate limiting, which would interfere with the distortion measurements. Without the Audio Precision filter, there was 120mV of ultrasonic noise present at the amplifiers outputs.Looking first at the unbalanced line-level analog inputs, the Devialets voltage gain into 8 ohms with the volume control set to its maximum of \"30\" was 48.5dB, which is a little higher than is usual for an integrated amplifier. The gain with the control set to \"0.0\" was exactly 30dB lower. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with Phase set to \"+.\" My measurements indicated an input impedance of a suitably high 16.5k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, this dropping inconsequentially to 15.7k ohms at 20kHz.The output impedance is specified as an extraordinarily low 0.001 ohms. I measured a still-low 0.05 ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz, this  ure including the series impedance of 6 of loudspeaker cable. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by less than ±0.05dB   and the response into 2 ohms   was almost identical to that into 8 and 4 ohms  . As expected from the settings, the low-frequency response was –3dB at 10Hz. The output into 2 ohms   was down by just 0.125dB at 20kHz.Fig.1 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, frequency response at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , and simulated loudspeaker    .This graph was taken with the volume control set to \"0.0\" and neither the response nor the close channel-matching changed at different settings of the control. However, the Devialet amplifiers output rolls rapidly above 40kHz, and its reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave   featured the symmetrical ringing indicative of a linear-phase digital filter. The 140 Pro digitizes its analog input with a sample rate of 96kHz—although the sample rate is said to be switchable between 96kHz and 192kHz, I wasnt able to change it from 96kHz—meaning that a 10kHz squarewave was reproduced with just the third harmonic at 30kHz present  .Fig.2 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was good, at 90dB in both directions across most of the audioband, but when I looked at the crosstalk waveform on an oscilloscope, it was apparent that the measurement was dominated by noise. This higher-than-usual level of noise can be seen in  .4, which shows a spectral analysis of the Devialets low-frequency noise floor. While the individual FFT bins in this graph lie at or below –80dB, it suggests that the 140 Pros analog inputs are limited to 14-bit resolution. With the filter, the wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the volume control at \"0.0\" and the input shorted to ground, was 59.5dB, which improved to 68dB when A-weighted  . The level of random noise increased as the volume control setting was raised above \"0.0.\" The A-weighted ratio with the control set to \"30,\" for example, measured 38.5dB, ie, 30.5dB worse.Fig.4 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to \"0.0\"    .The Devialets maximum power is specified as 140W into 6 ohms  . I dont have a 6 ohm test load, but with \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%, I found that the 140 Pro clipped at 103W into 8 ohms   and 205W into 4 ohms  .Fig.5 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The Devialets THD+N at full power is specified as just 0.0005%. The downward slope of the traces in  s.5 and 6 suggests that the measurement is actually just showing noise up to the point when the waveform starts to clip.   I havent included a graph showing how THD+N percentage varies with frequency, therefore, as this graph would be dominated by noise. The waveform of the residual distortion and noise is just random noise  . But  s.5 and 6 indicate that the minimum THD+N percentage is just 0.02% into both 8 and 4 ohms.Fig.7 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.02% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .The spectrum of the Devialets output while I drove a low-frequency tone at a moderately high power into 8 ohms is shown in  .8; any distortion harmonics are below the level of random noise. I ran into problems when I tried to test for intermodulation distortion with my usual mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones. The amplifier went into protection with sustained high-power, high-frequency tones, reducing the output level. The spectrum in  .9 was taken at 8Wpc into 4 ohms, the highest power the amplifier would deliver continuously without its protection operating. Though the second-order difference product is absent, some low-level, high-order intermodulation products can be seen. However, the noise floor has an unusual scalloped appearance.Fig.8 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 33W into 8 ohms    .Fig.9 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 8W peak into 4 ohms    .Turning to the digital inputs, Apples USB Prober utility identified the Devialet amplifier as \"Expert Pro USB Audio 2.0\" from \"DEVIALET\" and indicated that the USB port operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. Apples AudioMIDI utility revealed that, via USB, the 140 Pro accepted 16- and 24-bit integer data sampled at all rates from 44.1 to 192kHz. All the digital inputs preserved absolute polarity  .With the Devialets volume control set to \"0.0,\" a 1kHz digital signal at 0dBFS resulted in a level of 25.18V into 8 ohms from the speaker outputs. Increasing the volume control to \"2.5\" clipped the amplifiers output with this signal, so I performed most of the testing via the digital inputs with the volume control set to \"0.0.\"The 140 Pros impulse response with 44.1kHz data was a typical linear-phase type, with symmetrical ringing before and after the single high sample  . With 44.1kHz-sampled white noise  , the Devialets response reached full stop-band attenuation at 24kHz, though the noise floor with this signal was higher than it was with a full-scale tone at 19.1kHz  . The harmonics of the 19.1kHz tone can be seen in this graph, with the third the highest in level, at –63dB  . The 140 Pros frequency responses with data at 44.1, 96, and 192kHz followed the same basic shape, but with a very sharp rolloff above half of each sample rate  .Fig.10 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, digital inputs, impulse response  .Fig.11 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, digital inputs, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS   with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.12 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, digital inputs, frequency response at –20dBFS with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .When I increased the bit depth from 16 to 24 with a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS, the random noise floor dropped by >20dB in the left channel  , meaning that the Devialets digital inputs offer almost 20 bits worth of resolution in this channel. However, the noise floor in the right channel   is higher than it is in the left and has an odd scalloped appearance. With undithered data representing a tone at exactly –90.31dBFS, the three DC voltage levels described by the data were well resolved and the waveform was perfectly symmetrical  . With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a superbly clean sinewave  .Fig.13 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, digital inputs, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.14 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, digital inputs, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.15 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, digital inputs, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Finally, tested for its rejection of word-clock jitter with 16-bit USB data, all the odd-order harmonics of the LSB-level, low-frequency squarewave were below the level of noise  . However, a pair of sidebands at ±120Hz to the sides of the peak that represents the high-level tone at one-quarter the sample rate can be seen, these power supply-related. Note that I had to reduce the volume to \"–24\" to make this measurement, to avoid the amplifier going into protection.Fig.16 Devialet Expert 140 Pro, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit USB data  . Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.In most respects, the Expert 140 Pro measures very similarly to the much- more-expensive Devialet D-Premier, which I reviewed favorably in January 2013. However, I was bothered by the higher-than-expected level of background noise—much higher than with the D-Premier—especially with the analog inputs.           ',\n",
       " 'Because of the darTZeel NHB-468s bulk and weight, and also because the amplifiers needed to be picked up for photography as soon as Michael Fremer had finished his auditioning, I drove my   system—see the January 2008 \"As We See It\"—its host computer, my digital and analog oscilloscopes, cables, and all the rest of my test gear to his New Jersey home to perform the measurements.Prior to trekking to Mikeys, I had received several emails from designer Hervé Delétraz about the new circuit topology he had incorporated in ?the NHB-468, which he calls CP2C  . Hervé explained to me that CP2C, which is patent pending, \"is mimicking a current source with the output impedance of a voltage source,\" which if you think about it involves mutually contradictory concepts. A current-source amplifier has a very high output impedance, meaning that the frequency response with a typical loudspeaker will feature huge fluctuations. By contrast, a voltage-source amplifier will have an output impedance close to 0 ohms.Putting on my thinking cap, I came up with two possibilities for how a current-source amplifier with the low output impedance of a voltage-source amplifier could be achieved. First, if the amplifiers voltage gain were varied by a microcontroller according to the current demanded by a loudspeaker at a particular frequency, the result would be a flat frequency response. However, I understand that modulating an amplifiers transfer function with the input signal would have severe side effects, so this idea is likely a nonstarter.Second, what if the darTZeel amplifier were a mirror image of the Quad/ Devialet feed-forward topology? The Quad and Devialet amplifiers use a high-quality, high–output-voltage amplifier that runs in class-A but cannot deliver much current, with an auxiliary amplifier that dumps the necessary current into the load. What I was thinking of was a combination of a high-quality current-source amplifier with an auxiliary voltage-source amplifier. However, in one of his emails, Hervé wrote that CP2C is \"achieved by a very simple way of doing . . . This technology is fully analog and entirely full real time by design, it is part of the audio circuit itself.\" This idea is also unlikely, however, so I will see what the measurements uncover.Although MF exclusively used the 50 ohm Zeel input for his auditioning, I performed the measurements using the balanced   and single-ended   inputs. I didnt have time to precondition the darTZeel amplifier for a full hour at one-third power, but after driving one of the NHB-468s XLR input for 15 minutes or so, the heatsink on the amplifiers rear panel was warm, at 95°F  . The darTZeels voltage gain into 8 ohms is specified as 26dB or 32dB depending on whether the gain is set to \"26\" or \"32\" with the front-panel menu buttons and display. Using the XLR input, I measured 20.67dB and 26.1dB into 8 ohms; unusually, the gains with the single-ended input were 6dB higher and conformed to the Menu settings. The power indicated by the NHB-468s front-panel meter was close to what I measured and correctly doubled when the load impedance was halved.The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   for both XLR and RCA inputs. The balanced input impedance is specified as 20k ohms, which was confirmed by my measurements. I measured 10k ohms for the unbalanced input impedance rather than the specified 30k ohms, but the difference is inconsequential. The output impedance is specified as 0.28 ohms. I measured 0.3 ohms at low and middle frequencies, rising very slightly to 0.31 ohms at the top of the audioband. This is relatively high for a voltage-source amplifier but very low for a current-source amplifier.And then I ran into trouble. After measuring the RCA inputs gain and impedance, I switched back to the XLR input. However, the amplifiers front-panel meter showed a high level of noise, the gain was at least 6dB higher than before, and the amplifier clipped just below 2W into 8 ohms. Something had gone wrong. I switched off this sample—serial number TZ-UE1468.010R—and performed a full set of measurements on the other sample, S/N 010L, using just the XLR input.This samples voltage gains, input impedances, and output impedances were all identical to those of the first sample. The audioband response into impedances of 4 ohms and above   is flat up to 20kHz, and the output into 2 ohms   was down by just 0.25dB at 20kHz. The ultrasonic rolloff varied with the load impedance. At 200kHz, the limit of the horizontal scale in  .1, the NHB-468s output was down by 0.5dB into 16 ohms, by 1dB into 8 ohms, by 2dB into 4 ohms, and by 4dB into 2 ohms. This amplifier has a wide small-signal bandwidth, and its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 Dartzeel NHB-468, frequency response at 2.83V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Dartzeel NHB-468, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the balanced gain set to \"32\" and the XLR input shorted to ground, was 72.3dB, which improved to 84.7dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 87.2dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the darTZeels noise floor   revealed that while the random noise was somewhat higher than I usually find, the spuriae related to the power-line frequency were all very low in level. Note, by the way, that this spectrum was taken with a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms. Referred to the NHB-468s maximum output into 8 ohms  , the levels of random noise components will be reduced by 26dB.Fig.3 Dartzeel NHB-468, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The manual specifies the darTZeels maximum power as 475W into 8 ohms  , 625W into 4 ohms  , and 222W into 2 ohms  , with the latter noted as \"design limited.\" However, Hervé noted in another email that he needed \"to finalize and adjust some things in the user manual and in the technical specs, especially the power output which is a bit lower than we currently indicate on our website . . . due to the final tune-in we did before launching the production, after having already measured the beasts. I didnt want to readjust output power after our final fine tune-in   since the sound would have been altered.\"With that caution in mind and with \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%, I found that the NHB-468 clipped at 216W into 16 ohms  , 398W into 8 ohms  , 205W into 4 ohms  , and 101W into 2 ohms  . In each case, the amplifiers protection circuitry operated soon after the THD+N reached 1%. This amplifier offers high powers into higher impedances, but regarding the reduction in ultimate power into lower impedances, Hervé had explained in one of his emails that the 468s circuit is optimized for loads of 6 ohms, with the distribution of power \"as if we would always work into the SOA  , not only for the output devices, but for the entire amplifier circuit design.\"Fig.4 Dartzeel NHB-468, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 16 ohms.Fig.5 Dartzeel NHB-468, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Dartzeel NHB-468, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Dartzeel NHB-468, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.\"This is also one of the reasons John will measure output powers not at all doubling when load will be halved,\" he wrote, \"and even output power decreasing under 3 ohms.\"Hervé had also predicted that, as the NHB-468 has no global negative feedback, there would be \"plenty of THD for John.\" This can be seen at high powers into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms  , as well as in  .8, which shows how the darTZeel amplifiers THD+N percentage varied at 8.975V with frequency into 16, 8, 4, and 2 ohms.   More significantly, even without global negative feedback, the traces in  .8 reveal that the NHB-468s distortion doesnt increase with frequency, which you often see with solid-state amplifiers that dont have a lot of feedback.Fig.8 Dartzeel NHB-468, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.975V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The waveform of the residual distortion and noise with a 1kHz signal   suggests that the subjectively benign second harmonic is dominant, which was confirmed by spectral analysis  , though higher-order harmonics are present at lower levels. High-order intermodulation products with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 50W into 8 ohms were relatively low in level  , though the second-order difference product lay at –70dB  .Fig.9 Dartzeel NHB-468, 1kHz waveform at 52W into 8 ohms, 0.073% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Dartzeel NHB-468, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Dartzeel NHB-468, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 50W peak into 8 ohms  .The darTZeel NHB-468s measured performance reveals it to be an intriguing design, though I couldnt find anything that would be due to the CP2C circuit. And while I was measuring the second sample, Michael Fremer found that selecting the first samples meter options with the Menu seemed to force the amplifier to reset itself, after which gain, noise, and distortion returned to normal. Therefore, it looks as if when I selected the RCA input with the Menu then went back to the XLR input, the gain was not reset correctly, leading to the problems I found. As I found this occurred with both samples, I suspect that this must therefore be a firmware problem and could be addressed with a firmware update.           ',\n",
       " '  Dan DAgostino M400 MxV amplifiers, serial number 5879, with my  ,  following the CEAs recommendation: I ran it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the side-mounted heatsinks were hot, at 106.1°F  , and the top panel was hotter, at 110.5°F  . After testing the amplifier at high powers, the temperature of the top panel had risen to 120.4°F/49.1°C. The M400 MxV needs to be well-ventilated.The DAgostinos voltage gain was 26.9dB into 8 ohms, and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  . The specified input impedance is 1M ohm. I measured 183k ohms at 20Hz, 152k ohms at 1kHz, and 129k ohms at 20kHz. Though lower than the specified value, these impedances are still usefully high.Fig.1 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The DAgostinos output impedance was 0.5 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.55 ohm at 20kHz.   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was small, at ±0.25dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB just above 100kHz, though the increasing output impedance at very high frequencies means that the ultrasonic rolloff into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms   was slightly greater. The M400 MxVs reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   was superb, with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.3 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms   and ay 100W into 8 ohms    .Measured with the balanced input shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was a very good 79.3dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 81dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 84dB when A-weighted. While spuriae at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its harmonics were present in the M400 MxVs noisefloor  , these are negligible at –90dB and below ref. 1W into 8 ohms  . As expected, the levels of these spuriae ref. 100W into 8 ohms   were as much as 20dB lower.Fig.4 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The Dan DAgostino M400 MxV is specified as offering maximum output powers of 400W into 8 ohms, 800W into 4 ohms, and 1600W into 2 ohms  . With our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, the M400 MxV clipped with a 1kHz signal at 442W into 8 ohms   and at 778W into 4 ohms  . The AC wall voltage had dropped from 119.7V with the amplifier idling to 118.7V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms, which is why the M400 MxV didnt quite meet its specified power into this load. Similarly, although I measured a clipping power of 1050W into 2 ohms, the wall voltage had dropped to 116V at this power.Fig.6 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .I examined how the percentage of THD+N changed with frequency at 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms, 100W into 4 ohms, and 200W into 2 ohms. The distortion was low into 8 ohms, with a slight rise in the top of the audioband  , but rose into 4 ohms   and 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.029% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50W into 4 ohms  .The M400 MxVs distortion driving 1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms was predominantly the second harmonic  , though higher-order harmonics are present at lower levels  . The third harmonic rose almost to the same level as the second, close to –70dB  , at the same power into 4 ohms   and at 100W into 8 ohms  .>Fig.10 Dan DAgostino M400 MxV, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .When the M400 MxV drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones with a peak level of 50W into 8 ohms  , both the second-order difference product at 1kHz and the higher-order intermodulation products at 18kHz and 21kHz lay at –77dB  . At the same voltage into 4 ohms, these intermodulation products rose by 7dB, but this is still a respectably low level.The Dan DAgostino M400 MxV did well on the test bench, offering very high power with sufficiently low levels of distortion and noise.           ',\n",
       " '  Peachtree iDecco, I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system   .Before I did any testing of the iDecco, I ran it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour, which imposes the maximum heat stress on an amplifier with a class-AB output stage. At the end of that time, the iDecco was hot but not bothered.Looking first at the iDeccos performance as a digital decoder, a full-scale 1kHz tone clipped the amplifiers output stage with the volume control set to 2:30. The level from the variable preamp outputs with the tube in-circuit was 848mV in this condition. The maximum level from the line-level output jacks was 2.06V, sourced from a low impedance of 10 ohms, and while both the loudspeaker outputs and the fixed-level line outs preserved absolute polarity for digital sources, the variable preamp outputs inverted polarity with the tube. Other than when noted, I continued the digital testing from the fixed line-level outputs with the volume control set to its minimum, to avoid stressing the iDeccos amplifier output stage.The iDecco locked to S/PDIF datastreams with sample rates ranging from 32 to 96kHz, but not to data with sample rates greater than 96kHz. The top two pairs of traces in  .1 show the iDeccos D/A frequency response with 44.1kHz data   and 96kHz data   with the rear-panel Filter pushbutton set to Fast. The response is flat and extended at both frequency extremes, at least until the inevitable steep rolloff just below half the sample rate. By contrast, the green and gray traces in  .1 show the response with 44.1kHz taken from the variable preamp outputs with the tube operating, the volume control set to 2:00 and the Filter set to Slow, offset by 1dB for clarity. There is now a slight   imbalance between the channels and the low-frequency response is down 3dB at 11Hz. At the other end of the spectrum, the effect of the Slow filter is to roll off the top-octave output a little early, the response being down 3dB at 19.5kHz.Fig.1 Peachtree iDecco, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms from fixed outputs with data sampled at 44.1kHz   and 96kHz  , and from variable outputs with volume control set to 2:00  .  Testing the DACs resolution with a swept bandpass filter while it decoded a dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS gave the traces shown in  .2. The top pair of traces were taken at the variable preamp jacks, again set to 2:00, with 16-bit data, and the bottom pair with 24-bit data; you can see that the increase in bit depth drops the noise floor by 10dB or so in the treble. There is a slight bump at the 60Hz AC line frequency, but this is sufficiently far down in level not to be an issue. Repeating the analysis, this time from the fixed-level jacks with an FFT technique, gave the traces shown in  .3. The increase in bit depth now drops the noise floor by 18dB, which implies that the iDeccos ESS 9600 Sabre chip has at least 19-bit resolution. However, some harmonics of the AC frequency can be seen with the 24-bit data  , and a regular series of distortion harmonics is also unmasked by the lowering of the noise floor. DAC linearity error with 16-bit data   was vanishingly low to below –100dBFS, and the iDeccos noise floor was low enough to allow the three DC voltage levels that describe an undithered 16-bit tone at –90.31dBFS to be readily resolved  . With undithered 24-bit data, the result was a noisy but otherwise well-defined sinewave  .Fig.2 Peachtree iDecco, 1/3-octave spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with 16-bit data   and 24-bit data  .  Fig.3 Peachtree iDecco, FFT-derived spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data  .Fig.4 Peachtree iDecco, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .Fig.5 Peachtree iDecco, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .When it came to distortion, the two line-level outputs varied dramatically. The blue and red traces in  .6 show the spectrum of a full-scale 50Hz tone at the fixed-output jacks. The second harmonic lies at –90dB  , the third at –80dB  , and the fourth at –110dB  . By contrast, while the third harmonic remains at the same level from the tubed variable-output jacks, the fourth harmonic has risen to –90dB and, more significant, the second has risen to –50dB  . In both cases, a picket fence of very-low-level spuriae is also visible. The primary difference between the two outputs is that, with the variable jacks, the signal passes through a 6922 tube. It is the \"bent\" transfer function of this tube that generates the even-order distortion.Fig.6 Peachtree iDecco, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 0dBFS into 100k ohms from fixed outputs  , and from variable outputs with volume control set to 2:00  .  As can be seen in  .1, the slow in \"Slow Filter\" refers to the rate of the reconstruction filters ultrasonic rolloff. It is generally felt that a slower rate of rolloff sounds better, but the downside is that there is less rejection of the ultrasonic images that result from the digitizing of the signal. This can be seen in  .7, which shows the spectrum of the iDeccos fixed outputs while it decoded 24-bit data representing an equal mix of high-level 19 and 20kHz tones. The primary ultrasonic image of the two tones is suppressed by just 12dB, and other aliasing spuriae are folded down into the audioband. Switching this filter to Fast gives the spectrum shown in  .8: the ultrasonic images have dropped significantly in level, as have the audioband aliasing spuriae. The primary intermodulation product, at 1kHz, has risen slightly, to –96dB  , but this is still negligible in absolute terms.Fig.7 Peachtree iDecco, HF intermodulation spectrum, Slow Filter, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms  .Fig.8 Peachtree iDecco, HF intermodulation spectrum, Fast Filter, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 0dBFS into 100k ohms  .The iDecco offers three choices of digital input: S/PDIF  , USB, and from an iPod plugged into the top-panel dock; a second rear-panel pushbutton selects between Wide and Narrow receiver PLL bandwidths. The Wide setting is to allow the iDecco to successfully lock to digital sources with poor-tolerance clocks; however, the downside is that this gives rise to increased levels of jitter. Fig.9, for example, shows the spectrum with the 16-bit J-Test signal fed to the iDecco via TosLink. Though data-related jitter other than the sidebands at ±229Hz is at the residual level, there are strong sidebands at ±1.8kHz, and a significant widening of the central spectral peak due to random low-frequency clock variations. The jitter level was 519 picoseconds peak–peak, according to the Miller Analyzer. This is still low in absolute terms, but switching to the Narrow setting lowered the jitter level to below 200ps, narrowed the central peak in the spectrum, eliminated the high-frequency sidebands, and reduced all data-related sidebands to the residual level of the test signal  , which is superb performance.Fig.9 Peachtree iDecco, Wide receiver, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz, 16-bit data from SYS2722 via 15 TosLink. Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz  .Fig.10 Peachtree iDecco, Narrow receiver, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz, 16-bit data from SYS2722 via 15 TosLink. Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz  .The iDecco takes data from an iPod in digital format; repeating the jitter test with the 16-bit J-Test signal playing on an iPod Classic 160GB gave a low 310ps of jitter. While there were no data-related sidebands present in the spectrum  , there were sidebands of unknown origin present at ±91 and ±816Hz. Feeding USB data from my MacBook gave just 260ps of jitter, from sidebands at ±1423Hz  . The iDecco offers excellent rejection of jitter, though with both iPod and USB sources there was significant widening of the central spectral peak, again due to the presence of random low-frequency jitter. Examining the iDecco with the Macs USB Prober utility identified the USB receiver as a \"USB Audio DAC\" from \"Burr Brown from TI\" operating in adaptive isochronous mode, and indicated that it accepted 16-bit data with sample rates of 32, 44.1, and 48kHz only.Fig.11 Peachtree iDecco, Narrow receiver, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz, 16-bit data from iPod Classic. Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz  .Moving on to the iDeccos amplification section, the output from the speaker jacks preserved polarity   for digital inputs, but inverted absolute polarity for analog signals fed to the Aux input via the tube. The maximum gain for analog input signals was fairly low for an integrated amplifier, at 28.7dB into 8 ohms. The Aux input impedance was usefully high, at 48k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly but inconsequentially to 42k ohms at the top of the audioband.I had to scratch my head a bit when  iDeccos output impedance. I perform this measurement by comparing the output voltage with the amplifier driving 8 or 4 ohms with how much that voltage rises when I remove the load. A simple Ohms Law calculation then gives me the amplifiers output impedance  . However, when I disconnected the load with the iDecco, the output voltage dropped, suggesting that the Peachtree actually has a negative output impedance of about –0.2 ohm. This can be seen in the plot of the amplifiers frequency response  , where the output with the 2 ohm load   is higher than it is with 4 or 8 ohms. This is unusual, and suggests that the amplifier circuit uses a degree of positive feedback. However, the variation in response with our simulated speaker   is very low.Fig.12 Peachtree iDecco, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Note the low-frequency rolloff in  .12, which, at –3dB at 55Hz, is even more extreme than that seen in the response from the preamp outputs  . I was puzzled by this, but after some thought I repeated the response measurements at various settings of the volume control. The traces in  .12, taken with the volume control at its maximum, are repeated as the bottom pair of traces in  .13. The other traces in this graph were taken at progressively lower settings of the volume control, and you can see that the iDeccos low frequencies are well extended at volume-control settings of 12:00 and below. It looks as if the iDecco reduces its low-frequency bandwidth as you increase the volume beyond 12:00, and that this is performed in the tubed preamp section.Fig.13 Peachtree iDecco, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with volume control set to  : maximum, 3:00, 2:00, 12:00, 9:00  .Fig.12 indicates that the iDeccos ultrasonic response extends well beyond the 200kHz limit of this graph. This correlates with very short risetimes on its response to a 10kHz squarewave, but there is a small degree of overshoot with very-high-frequency ringing into lower impedances  . Channel separation was good rather than great, at 87dB R–L and 59dB L–R at 1kHz, as was the wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio   at 67.5dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This was primarily due to low-level spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics that I couldnt eliminate by experimenting with the grounding between the iDecco and the Audio Precision test system. A-weighting the S/N ratio, which discounts the effects of LF and HF noise, thus improved the result to 83dB.Fig.14 Peachtree iDecco, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 4 ohms.Peachtree specifies the iDeccos maximum output power as 40Wpc into 6 ohms   rather than the usual 8 ohms. However,  .15 shows that the amplifier didnt clip   until 40Wpc into 8 ohms   and 53Wpc into 4 ohms  . The low-power distortion is around 0.03%, but increases in a linear fashion with increasing power, this due to the mainly second-harmonic distortion introduced by the preamplifier stage  . Intermodulation distortion with an equal mix of high-frequency tones at a level just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen   was primarily the low-order difference product, at –50dB  , again this stemming from the tubed preamp stage; but the power-supply–related spuriae can also be seen in this graph, admittedly at a low level.Fig.15 Peachtree iDecco, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4 ohms.Fig.16 Peachtree iDecco, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  , 0.155% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.17 Peachtree iDecco, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.18 Peachtree iDecco, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms  .Peachtrees iDecco may be budget-priced, but it packs a lot of functionality into a small package. Its D/A section is particularly impressive technically, especially regarding its resolution and rejection of jitter, but you need to take the output from the fixed line-level jacks to get the maximum performance from it. As an integrated amplifier, the iDeccos performance is dominated by its tubed preamp section, which introduces even-order harmonic distortion much like that of a classic tubed amplifier.

       " '  Audio Research Reference 150 using Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  .  , I installed a new set of tubes, both the 6H30 small-signal tubes and the four matched pairs of KT120 output tubes. The instructions in the manual for setting the bias current for each pair were clear: With zero input signal, each main tube was set to a voltage drop of 65mV DC, measured at its test points, with the slave tube running between 57 and 73mV at its test points. The only tricky part of this operation was that the test points were close to the tubes hot glass envelopes, which resulted in occasional mild curses as I brushed a tube with my fingers.The Reference 150 has three output-transformer taps, marked 16, 8, and 4 ohms, and a common ground terminal. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity from all three taps  , with the input XLRs wired with pin 2 hot. The voltage gain into 8 ohms was 26.5dB from the 16 ohm tap, 23.9dB from the 8 ohm tap, and 21.3dB from the 4 ohm tap. The input impedance was very high at all frequencies, at approximately the specified 300k ohms.  As expected, the Ref150s output impedance varied according to the transformer tap selected. The 16 ohm tap measured 1.4 ohms at low and middle frequencies, rising to 1.9 ohms at the top of the audioband. The  ures for the 8 ohm tap were 1 and 1.4 ohms; for the 4 ohm tap, they were 0.55 and 0.87 ohm. All three taps offer quite a low source impedance for a transformer-coupled design; as a result, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms Law action between that impedance and that of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was relatively mild. From the 8 ohm tap  , it was ±0.8dB; the 4 ohm tap offered ±0.4dB, the 16 ohm tap ±1dB. Fig.1 indicates that the Ref150 has a wide bandwidth, particularly into loads higher than the nominal tap value, which correlates with a well-defined 10kHz squarewave  . While this graph reveals a small but critically damped overshoot on the leading edges of the waveform, presumably due to an ultrasonic transformer resonance, no ringing is visible. Channel separation   was superb, at >100dB at 1kHz.Fig.1 Audio Research Reference 150, 8 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Audio Research Reference 150, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Ref150 was fairly quiet, though the left channel was noisier than the right. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratios, ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms and taken from the 8 ohm output with the input shorted, were 70.1dB left and 82.1dB right. When A-weighted, these  ures improved to 88.5 and 99.2dB, respectively. Fig.3 shows a spectral analysis of the amplifiers low-frequency noise floor, taken while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms from the 4 ohm tap. The left channel has a higher level than the right of AC-supply–related spuriae, primarily at 60, 120, 180, and 300Hz, which is presumably why its S/N ratios were not as good. What really puzzled me in this graph was the appearance in both channels of a spectral component at 100Hz, which is related neither to the signal frequency nor to the AC line frequency.   I checked and double-checked this measurement, with no change in the result.Fig.3 Audio Research Reference 150, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .All taps behaved similarly when it came to the maximum output power. Into a load twice the nominal tap value, the Ref150 clipped   at 90W  . Into the nominal tap value, it clipped at the specified 150W  , but with a higher level of distortion. Into half the tap value, the amplifier clipped at 80W  , but with even higher distortion at lower powers. It is important, therefore, to use the transformer tap that best matches your preferred loudspeaker.Fig.4 Audio Research Reference 150, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Audio Research Reference 150, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Audio Research Reference 150, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Fig.7 plots the THD+noise percentage from the 4 ohm tap into loads ranging from 2 to 16 ohms at a level, 4V, where the actual distortion rises above the noise floor. The THD increases at low frequencies due to the onset of saturation in the output transformer, and in the top octave due to the decreasing open-loop gain margin in this region reducing the effectiveness of the negative feedback. But over most of the audioband, and when the load impedance is very much higher than the transformer-tap value, the Ref150 offers low distortion. The picture from the 8 and 16 ohm taps was similar  , but with higher levels of distortion overall.Fig.7 Audio Research Reference 150, 4 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 4V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .At low power, the content of the distortion is predominantly second-harmonic in nature  , the second harmonic being subjectively innocuous both because of its proximity to the fundamental tone and because adding a tone an octave higher than the fundamental is musically natural. At higher powers and at low frequencies, a regular series of harmonics appears  , this connected with the Ref150s relatively small amount of overall negative feedback. This, and the circuits decreasing linearity at high frequencies, means that the Audio Research amplifier does only moderately well on the demanding high-frequency intermodulation test  , with the difference product at 1kHz lying at –54dB  .Fig.8 Audio Research Reference 150, 8 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  , 0.1% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Audio Research Reference 150, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 37W into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Audio Research Reference 150, 4 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 30W peak into 4 ohms  .A successful tube-amplifier design must walk a narrow path between competing aspects of performance. Audio Researchs Reference 150 successfully treads that path, with the caveat that it performs at its best with loudspeakers that have impedances equal to or higher than the nominal output-tap impedance.

       " 'All measurements presented here are for balanced operation. Following its 1/3-power, one-hour preconditioning test, the Electrocompaniet Nemos chassis was quite warm to the touch, but not uncomfortably so. The amps input impedance measured 301k ohms  . The output voltage was rendered slightly unstable by infrasonic noise—not enough to be of concern during normal operation, but enough to render such high input-impedance measurements less than fully reliable. I can say, however, that the Nemo has a far higher input impedance than do most solid-state power amplifiers.The output impedance measured higher than specified, at between 0.17 and 0.23 ohms, depending on frequency and the load impedance used to derive the measurement. These are moderately high values for a solid-state amplifier—enough to cause, into real loudspeaker loads, a small frequency-response deviation that might be marginally audible.The Nemo is noninverting when driven balanced with pin 2 positive, or via the unbalanced adaptor. DC offset measured 0.4mV. The Electrocompaniets voltage gain into 8 ohms measured a high 34.3dB. The signal/noise ratio   measured 89.6dB over a 22Hz–22kHz bandwidth, 80.2dB from 10Hz to 50kHz, and 93.3dB A-weighted.Fig.1 shows the Nemos frequency response, with a 0.25dB error visible into our simulated speaker load. The 10kHz squarewave response   exhibits a good risetime, with a slight rounding of the leading edge—very common among even the best amplifiers—and no overshoot or ringing.   The THD+noise percentage vs frequency curves are plotted in  .3. The results show increasing levels of distortion at lower load impedances and higher frequencies, but the distortion overall remains quite low. The distortion increases slightly when the amplifier is driven unbalanced  , but remains insignificant at these low power levels.Fig.1 Electrocompaniet Nemo, frequency response at  : 2W into 4 ohms, 1W into 8 ohms, and 2.828V into simulated loudspeaker load,  .Fig.2 Lexicon MC-1, ADC frequency response at 1V input  .Fig.3 Electrocompaniet Nemo, THD+noise   vs frequency at  : 4W into 2 ohms, 2W into 4 ohms, 2.83V into simulated loudspeaker load, and 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.4 shows the waveform of the Nemos distortion at 2W into 4 ohms: third-harmonic distortion clearly predominates. The distortion waveforms are very similar at 1W into 8 and 2 ohms  . Because of the Nemos very high power output and the limitations of our test load, I looked at the 50Hz spectrum of 400W into 8 ohms instead of the usual 4 ohms  . All artifacts are below –80dB   with, again, the third-harmonic highest in level.Fig.4 Electrocompaniet Nemo, 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  , distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.5 Electrocompaniet Nemo, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 400W into 4 ohms  .Fig.6 shows the Nemos response, at 376W into 8 ohms, to a combined 19+20kHz signal—the intermodulation products resulting from an input signal consisting of an equal combination of these two frequencies.   Again, the resulting IM distortion is below –80dB   everywhere, except at 18kHz  , where it is a still-low –74dB  .Fig.6 Electrocompaniet Nemo, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–22kHz, 19+20kHz at 376W into 4 ohms  .It was during the HF intermodulation measurement that a brief overload from a too-high input shut down the Nemo. I lowered the input level and the amp returned to normal operation. However, there was the distinct smell of a burnt part, possibly a resistor. The smell dissipated, and the amplifier continued to operate normally, with consistently good measurements. When I then retested the Nemo, its frequency response was unchanged, but its THD+noise readings seemed a bit unstable, giving different results at different times but always remaining well below 0.1%.  The Nemos 1kHz, THD+noise percentage vs output power curves are shown in  .7. The amplifiers high power output is obvious. Again, because of the Nemos high power and the limited capability of our test load, I took no readings into 2 ohms. The only oddity in these curves is the rise in distortion at lower power.   The discrete clipping measurements   indicated a power output of 757W   into 8 ohms, and 1145W   into 4 ohms  .Fig.7 Electrocompaniet Nemo, distortion   vs continuous output power into   8 ohms and 4 ohms.This is an excellent set of measurements for a very high-powered amplifier.—Thomas J. Norton          ',\n",
       " 'Following its 1/3-power, one-hour preconditioning test, the Manley 175 was no warmer than normal for a tube amplifier. Its input impedance at 1kHz measured 146k ohms; its output impedance was 1.6–1.7 ohms at low and middle frequencies, decreasing slightly to just under 1.5 ohms at 20kHz into 4 ohms. These are middle-of-the-road values for a tube amplifier, in my experience. The Manleys performance—particularly its overall in-system frequency response—will be somewhat dependent on the partnering loudspeaker.The 175s voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 28.1dB; DC offset was a low 0.7mV; signal/noise   measured 95.7dB. The amplifier was non-inverting in its unbalanced mode.Fig.1 shows the frequency response of the 175. The differences between its 8 ohm and 4 ohm responses, within the audible range, is insignificant. The 175s 10kHz squarewave   indicates one cycle of damped, ultrasonic ringing  , also visible as a very narrow overshoot spike in the 1kHz squarewave  , which is otherwise a textbook squarewave.Fig.1 Manley 175, frequency response  : into 8 ohms and 4 ohms  .Fig.2 Manley 175, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Manley 175, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The THD+noise vs frequency curves are shown in  .4, suitably low other than into the punishing 2 ohm load. The 1kHz distortion waveform in  .5, for 2W output into 4 ohms, indicates a mainly second-order component. The result for 1W into 4 ohms   was similar, but for 4W into 2 ohms  , the distortion becomes third-order, with a higher-order component also present.Fig.4 Manley 175, THD+noise   vs frequency at  : 1W into 8 ohms; 2W into 4 ohms; 4W into 2 ohms.Fig.5 Manley 175, 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 Manley 175, 1kHz waveform at 4W into 2 ohms  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .The spectrum of the 175s output reproducing 50Hz into 4 ohms at a level of 113W is shown in  .7; the largest artifact is the third harmonic at 150Hz at –37dB, or about 1.5%, with the second and fifth harmonics not far behind. Fig.8 shows the output spectrum with the 175 amplifying a combined 19+20kHz signal  . The level was 52W into 8 ohms, with clipping visible just above this power level. The highest artifacts here are at 1kHz   and 21kHz  . The artifacts of this input signal at 53W into 4 ohms   were 5–8dB higher: about 1% at 1kHz, and 1.2% at 21kHz. Both the 50Hz and the 19+20kHz spectral responses are acceptable performance for a high-power tube amplifier, though not at all exceptional compared with the best weve measured from amplifiers in general.Fig.7 Manley 175, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 113W into 4 ohms  . Note that the third harmonic at 150Hz is the highest in level at –37dB  .Fig.8 Manley 175, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–22kHz, 19+20kHz at 52W into 8 ohms  .The 1kHz THD+N vs output power curves are shown in  .9. The distortion characteristic here is quite different from that of most solid-state amplifiers. The distortion increases unmistakably up to the break-point, or knee. The overall levels of distortion are moderately high—though acceptable—and the amplifier doesnt quite make its power specs. The clipping levels are shown in Table 1 for three levels of THD+N.  Fig.9 Manley 175, distortion   vs output power into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, and 2 ohms.Table 1: Maximum Output PowerLoad  1% THD+N1.5% THD+N3% THD+NohmsW  W  W  8126  127.5  132.6  448  87.5  *160    317   26.8  78.4  All line voltages 115V except * = 114VOverall, the measurement results for the 175 are good for a high-powered tube amplifier. The 175s distortion at lower impedances restrains its power output for a given level of distortion, but it will put out significant power into 4 ohms if you allow for a 3% THD+N level  .As delivered from Dick Olsher, the bias levels of the 175s output tubes had been set about 20% below the recommended values. I rebiased the tubes according to the manufacturers directions; the above results reflect this. However, before doing this, I made several measurements at the lower bias setting; the differences, while favoring the recommended bias, were not particularly significant. I measured about 10W more output into 8 ohms, and only marginally lower distortion with the correct bias. Apparently, this adjustment isnt overly critical in the 175.—Thomas J. Norton          ',\n",
       " '  darTZeel CTH-8550s measured behavior using mainly Stereophiles loaner sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. s on an amplifier, I run it for 60 minutes at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms, which is thermally the worst case for an amplifier with a class-B or -AB output stage. Cold out of the box, the darTZeel offered 0.083% distortion at one-third power into 8 ohms. After 45 minutes of running with both channels driven at this level, the THD+noise had increased slightly, to 0.093%. More importantly, I cut short the preconditioning at that point, as the top panel was too hot to touch and the side-panels covering the heatsinks were so hot that I was concerned about the amplifier going into thermal runaway. Even with no signal, the CTH-8550s chassis gets very warm after a while—contrary to the manufacturers claim, this is definitely not a cool-running amplifier.The MM phono input of our review sample—\"Built for T.H.E. Show,\" according to the front-panel display—wasnt activated, but it did have an MC phono stage. As supplied, this offered 54.7dB of voltage gain at 1kHz, measured at the Rec Out jacks, and the input impedance was to specification, at 1000 ohms across the audioband. The RIAA error was commendably low in the audioband, with superb channel matching, but increased with increasing frequency above 10kHz, due to the manufacturer including the so-called \"Neumann 4th Pole\"  . The darTZeels MC input was quiet, with the wideband, unweighted S/N ratio measuring 51.6dB ref. an input of 500µV at 1kHz. It improved to 69dB when A-weighted. The phono stages distortion was very low, at typically 0.025%, and the overload margin at low and middle frequencies was superb, at 30dB. The margin dropped to just 5.2dB at 20kHz, however, which is disappointing. Fig.1 darTZeel CTH-8550, MC input RIAA error at 1mV input at 1kHz  Turning to the line stage, I didnt examine the behavior of the proprietary Zeel and darT inputs and outputs. The conventional unbalanced jacks had an input impedance of 42k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still-high 30k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced XLR jacks had an input impedance of 19k ohms across the audioband. All the inputs preserved absolute polarity, ie, were non-inverting, the XLRs being wired with pin 2 hot.Measured at the speaker terminals, the maximum line-input voltage gain into 8 ohms, with the volume control set to \"+12,\" was 38.4dB for unbalanced inputs and, unusually, 6dB lower at 32.4dB for the balanced input. The volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps; at \"0,\" the gain at the Preamp Out jacks was 0.27dB and at \"+12,\" it was 12.27dB. These jacks offered a usefully low output impedance of 80 ohms and again preserved absolute polarity.The CTH-8550s output impedance was quite high for a solid-state design, at 0.4 ohms in the bass, rising to 0.5 ohms at 20kHz. As a result, the modification of its frequency response by the usual Ohms Law interaction between this impedance and the load impedance of our simulated loudspeaker reached ±0.25dB  , which will be audible. The small-signal response into 8 ohms   was flat within the audioband and didnt reach –3dB until 125kHz. This wide bandwidth correlated with a well-shaped 10kHz squarewave  , and didnt vary significantly with the volume control setting. Into increasingly low load impedances, however, the upper –3dB frequency progressively dropped and the beginning of an infrasonic rise in response became evident  .Fig.2 darTZeel CTH-8550, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.3 darTZeel CTH-8550, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The CTH-8550s channel separation was good rather than great, at 78dB in both directions below 1kHz, reducing to 65dB at 20kHz. This is rather less than the specified 90dB, however. The background noise level, measured with an unbalanced input short-circuited and the volume control at its maximum setting was –63.6dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms  . The A-weighted S/N ratio was 87.2dBA, ref. the same level, which is a little lower than the manufacturers specification of >115dBA ref. full power.The darTZeel comfortably exceeded its maximum power specification. This can be seen in  .4, which plots the THD+noise percentage against output power into 8 and 4 ohms with both channels driven, and into 2 ohms with one channel driven. Defining clipping as 1% THD+N, the CTH-8550 clipped at 230W into 8 ohms  , 375W into 4 ohms  , and 450W into 2 ohms  . The distortion starts to rise above the noisefloor at levels of a few hundred milliwatts, but was not particularly low. The traces in  .5 were taken at a constant 10V into 8, 4, and 2 ohms, and only really show acceptably low distortion into the higher impedances. Ameliorating this behavior, to some extent at least, will be the fact that the THD+N percentage doesnt increase with frequency.Fig.4 darTZeel CTH-8550, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.5 darTZeel CTH-8550, THD+N  vs frequency at 10V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The bottom trace in  .6 shows the waveform of the spuriae; the peaks in that waveform occur suspiciously close to the zero crossing points of the sinewave signal  , which suggest the presence of crossover distortion. Given how hot the amplifier runs, which suggests a high output bias current for the output stage, this surprised me. FFT-derived spectral analysis of the amplifiers output at low levels indicates that the dominant harmonics present are the second and third harmonics  , which are relatively innocuous, subjectively speaking. At higher powers, however, a regular series of higher-order harmonics makes an appearance   and the amplifiers performance on the demanding high-frequency intermodulation test is disappointing  .Fig.6 darTZeel CTH-8550, 1kHz waveform at 20.4W into 4 ohms  , 0.206% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.7 darTZeel CTH-8550, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.8 darTZeel CTH-8550, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 96W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 darTZeel CTH-8550, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 135W peak into 4 ohms  .\"Disappointing\" is the word I would use overall to describe the darTZeels measurements. When   first product from this Swiss company, the NHB-108 amplifier that Wes Phillips reviewed in April 2005, which had a very similar measured performance, I wrote that \"The NHB-108s measured performance indicates that, with the exception of its slightly bent transfer function, designer Hervé Delétraz has avoided the problem most commonly associated with the absence of the usual overall negative-feedback loop.\" But like the earlier design, the CTH-8550 hasnt managed to reduce the measured aberrations to the point where I could confidently describe them as inaudible under all circumstances. Which is a shame, given the amplifiers beautiful appearance and versatile user interface. Footnote 1: See Keith Howards article on the RIAA equalization in general, and this subject in particular, in the March 2009 issue.          ',\n",
       " 'I used my   system to examine the Octave Jubilee Mono SEs measured performance.   I followed the instructions in the manual to check the bias of the eight output tubes after running the amplifier for 30 minutes to allow the operating conditions to stabilize. The pots that allow the bias for each tube to be optimized have a somewhat coarse action. The best I could arrange was for the bias for the tubes to lie between \"1005\" and \"1025\" as indicated by the digital meter on the amplifiers top panel.The Octave Jubilee Mono SE preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, with both the balanced and single-ended inputs. The voltage gain at 1kHz was 29dB into 8 ohms for both inputs, this inconsequentially lower than the specified 30dB. The balanced input impedance was a high 51k ohms at all audio frequencies. The single-ended input impedance was even higher, at 74k ohms at 20Hz, 71k ohms at 1kHz, and 52k ohms at 20kHz.Octave doesnt specify the output impedance of the Jubilee Mono SEs single output transformer tap. I measured 2 ohms   at low and middle frequencies, rising to 4.5 ohms at the top of the audioband. The variation in the small-signal frequency response of the Jubilee Mono into our standard simulated loudspeaker   was ±1.2dB, which will be audible. The amplifiers response into 16 ohms   gently rose above 10kHz, before rolling off above 39kHz. The increase in output impedance in the top octave meant that the response increasingly rolled off as the load impedance was reduced. Into 2 ohms, for example, the output was down by 4dB at 20kHz  . A slight peak at 70kHz can be seen in the response traces; this correlated with a small amount of well-damped ringing in the Jubilee Monos reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  .Fig.1 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   was very good, measuring 73.2dB. This ratio improved to an excellent 90.5dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz and to 96.7dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor with the Octave amplifier driving a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms   revealed that AC-related spuriae were very low in level.Fig.3 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The Octave Jubilee Mono SEs maximum power is specified as 400W into 4 ohms  . With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—I measured a clipping power of 175W into 16 ohms  , 295W into 8 ohms  , and 68W into 4 ohms  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N, the Jubilee Mono clipped at 380W into 4 ohms  , just shy of its full rated power. In the Jubilee Monos manual, Octave says that the minimum recommended load impedance is 2 ohms.  maximum power into that load; the amplifier reached 3% THD+N at 88W  . I also examined how the power delivery changed if I switched the amplifier into the low-bias mode, which is indicated by the bias LED on the top panel turning from blue to green. However, the THD+N was very much higher than the very low distortion at low powers that can be seen in  s.5 and 6.Fig.4 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 16 ohms.Fig.5 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.Fig.8 shows how the percentage of THD+N varies with frequency into 16, 8, 4, and 2 ohms at 5V  . Other than the usual rise in the top audio octave, which will be due to the limited open-loop bandwidth, the THD+N was impressively low into 16 ohms  . However, it rose with each halving of the load impedance and was close to 1% into 2 ohms  .Fig.8 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, THD+N   vs frequency at 5V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .The Octaves distortion signature into 8 ohms predominantly comprised the second and third harmonics  . I recently received an email from veteran English engineer Ben Duncan   in which he told me that he had found a correlation between the smoothness of an amplifiers THD+N waveform and its sound quality. The spikier the waveform, the less its sound quality was preferred by listeners. By that criterion, even though the second and third harmonics in the Jubilee Mono SEs output each lie close to –60dB  , the relative absence of higher-order harmonics should result in good sound quality.  Fig.9 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.122% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Duncans finding depends on an amplifiers harmonic distortion not being accompanied by excessive levels of intermodulation distortion. The Jubilee Mono SE did okay when I looked at the spectrum of its output while it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10Wpc into 4 ohms  . The 1kHz difference product lay 70dB below the peak signal level  , while the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz lay at –60dB  .Fig.11 Octave Jubilee Mono SE, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 4 ohms  .The Octave Jubilee Mono SE offers massive power, albeit at relatively high levels of distortion, most likely due to a design decision only to use a modest amount of loop negative feedback. I commend the amplifier for its low levels of distortion at moderate powers into higher impedances, coupled with its benign distortion signature and its low levels of noise. I wouldnt recommend the Jubilee Monos use with loudspeakers whose impedance drops below 4 ohms, however. Footnote 1: Ben Duncan has contributed several technical articles to Stereophile.

       " 'My review sample of the PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP   was fitted with EL34 output tubes—I made sure that the bias was correctly set for these tubes before performing any testing. After allowing the DiaLogue Premium HP to warm up for an hour or so, I used my   system   to examine its measured performance. With 4 and 8 ohm output-transformer taps and the choice of triode   or ultralinear   operation, the DiaLogue Premium HP is four amplifiers in one; I looked at all four output conditions.The lowest maximum gain was in triode mode from the 4 ohm tap, at 33.55dB, with the 8 ohm tap 3.4dB higher. The maximum ultralinear gains were 35.7 and 37.1dB from the 4 and 8 ohm taps, respectively. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   in all four output conditions. The input impedance was 32k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz. This is usefully high, but still much lower than the specified 100k ohms.The output impedance depended on frequency, the transformer tap, and the mode of operation. The lowest impedance was from the 4 ohm tap in triode mode, at 1.1 ohms from 20Hz to 1kHz, rising to 1.33 ohms at 20kHz. Ultralinear mode slightly increased both of these impedances, by 0.1 ohm, while the 8 ohm tap almost doubled them. Even so, these impedances are significantly lower than with other PrimaLuna amplifiers I have measured, and the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response by the interaction of its output impedance with that of the loudspeaker was relatively mild. It ranged from ±0.8dB from the 4 ohm tap in triode mode   to ±1.3dB from the 8 ohm tap in ultralinear mode. Note the peak between 30 and 50kHz in  .1. This peak was at its highest from both taps into 8 ohms and higher impedances, but disappeared when the load impedance was well below the nominal transformer-tap value. But with the tap matched to the load, this peak was associated with a significant amount of overshoot on a 1kHz squarewave  , though a 10kHz squarewave revealed that the consequent ringing was critically damped  , the amplifier maintaining its stability. The flat tops and bottoms of these squarewaves correlate with the amplifiers extended low-frequency response; PrimaLunas output transformers are of excellent quality.Fig.1 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 4 ohm tap, triode mode, frequency response with volume control at its maximum at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 8 ohm tap, ultralinear mode, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 8 ohm tap, ultralinear mode, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum, and the channel balance is excellent. I repeated the response measurement with the volume control set to 12:00, equivalent to a gain reduction from the maximum of 17dB  , and the channel balance remained within 0.25dB and the frequency response didnt change. The DiaLogue Premium obviously uses a high-quality part for its volume control.Channel separation was adequate in both directions at and below 1kHz, at 70dB, but decreased to 44dB   and 49dB   at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio in ultralinear mode, measured at the 8 ohm tap with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum, was okay: 68.6dB left and 69.6dB right. Triode mode improved these ratios by 3dB, and A-weighting improved them to 75.6dB left and 77.7dB right. Spectral analysis of the noise floor   indicated a small level of 60Hz hum in both channels, due to magnetic interference from the AC transformer, but a slightly higher level of 120Hz in the left channel, at around –78dB  . This is actually good noise performance for a transformer-coupled tube design.Fig.4 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 8 ohm tap, triode mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 5–8 show how the THD+noise percentage in the PrimaLunas output varied with power with both channels driven from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms and from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms with triode and ultralinear modes, respectively. PrimaLuna specifies the maximum output power with EL34 output tubes as 40W into 8 ohms   in triode mode, and 70Wpc into 8 ohms   in ultralinear mode. We define clipping as when the THD+N in an amplifiers output reaches 1%, and these graphs show that the DiaLogue Premium didnt reach its specified power at 1% THD+N. However, if the clipping definition is relaxed to 3% THD+N, the amplifier meets its specified power when the load is matched to the nominal output-transformer tap.Fig.5 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 4 ohm tap, triode mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 8 ohm tap, triode mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 4 ohm tap, ultralinear mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 8 ohm tap, ultralinear mode, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.These graphs also indicate that the PrimaLuna amplifier doesnt offer the lowest distortion, though it remains between 0.1 and 0.2% at modest power levels. Figs. 9 and 10, taken at a level of 4V, which is when the THD rises above the noise floor, reveal that the lowest mid-frequency distortion was obtained when the 4 ohm tap was used to drive 8 ohms, and was lower in the right channel than the left. However, the distortion rises at the frequency extremes, particularly in the top audio octave, and as the load impedance drops. These graphs suggest that the 4 ohm tap is best used with loudspeakers whose impedance ranges from 4 to 16 ohms, as long as this tap can provide sufficient gain.Fig.9 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 4 ohm tap, triode mode, THD+N   vs frequency at 4V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.10 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 4 ohm tap, ultralinear mode, THD+N   vs frequency at 4V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the distortion is heavily second-harmonic in nature in both modes  , even at low frequencies  . Peculiarly, in this graph the low-frequency noise floor is higher in the right channel than in the left. Despite its reduced linearity at high frequencies, the DiaLogue Premium HP performed relatively well on the demanding high-frequency intermodulation test, with the 1kHz difference component at an output power of 10W into 8 ohms typically lying at around –60dB  .Fig.11 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 4 ohm tap, triode mode, 1kHz waveform at 2W into 4 ohms  , 0.24% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 8 ohm tap, triode mode, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP, 8 ohm tap, ultralinear mode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms  .Overall, the PrimaLuna DiaLogue Premium HP measures well for a design using push-pull pairs of EL34 tubes.

       " '  Unison Research Unico Primo    . As always before performing any measurements on an amplifier,  running it with both channels driven at one-third power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes. Thermally, this is the worst-case situation for an amplifier with a class-B or class-A/B output stage, as one-third power is when the maximum heat dissipation occurs in the output transistors. As the Unico Primos maximum power is specified in the manual as 80Wpc into 8 ohms, I set it driving 27Wpc into 8 ohms. However, the amplifier turned itself off after just 15 minutes at this power level. The two green LEDs on its front panel were slowly flashing, which, according to the manual, meant that the amplifiers protection circuitry had detected thermal overload. The internal heatsinks temperature was 113.2°F  , which didnt seem that hot. But I turned the Primo off and let it cool down for 30 minutes, after which I could turn it on again.This preconditioning test puts a significant strain on inexpensive amplifiers, which tend to have undersized heatsinks; it appears that the Unico Primo is not the best candidate for use at parties.I looked first at the phono input, which Ken Micallef had used with the default moving-magnet setting. Measured at the Tape Out jacks, this preserved absolute polarity   and offered a gain of 40.5dB. The input impedance measured 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping slightly to 39.6k ohms at the top of the audioband, and both the gain and impedance are appropriate for MM cartridges. Fig.1 shows the RIAA error: The two channels match closely, and while there is a slight rise in the top two octaves and a slight rolloff below 30Hz, both are low in absolute terms. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, measured with the input shorted to ground and ref. 1kHz at 5mV input voltage, was excellent, at 69dB, increasing when A-weighted to 79.3dB left and 80.5dB right. The phono inputs channel separation was also excellent, at >80dB above 2kHz.Fig.1 Unison Unico Primo, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .The MM stages overload margin was superb, at 26dB at all audio frequencies, this equivalent to an output voltage of 9.5V at the Tape Out jacks. Harmonic distortion was correspondingly low at typical MM signal levels, with the third harmonic of a 1kHz tone the highest in level at a very low –97dB  . Intermodulation distortion was similarly low in level  .Fig.2 Unison Unico Primo, phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 2V peak into 100k ohms  .Turning to the line inputs, the Unico Primos maximum gain into 8 ohms measured 40dB, which is typical for an integrated amplifier; these inputs also preserved absolute polarity. The input impedance was a usefully high 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 42k ohms at 20kHz. At 0.3 ohm, the Primos output impedance was on the high side for a solid-state design, presumably due to the low level of loop negative feedback. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker reached ±0.25dB  . This graph reveals that the Unison amplifier had a wide small-signal bandwidth even into 2 ohms  , but the 10kHz squarewave   shows no overshoot or ringing. Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; turning down this control also reduced the amplifiers bandwidth, but the response was still flat to 20kHz at the lower settings, and the excellent channel balance seen in  .1 was preserved.Fig.3 Unison Unico Primo, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.4 Unison Unico Primo, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation for a 1kHz line-level signal was a little disappointing, at 65dB R–L and 70dB L–R, and decreased with increasing frequency, reaching a poor 40dB at 20kHz. I also noted significant inter-input crosstalk, at –30dB at 1kHz for adjacent, unloaded inputs. The unweighted, wideband S/N ratio, measured with the line inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, was also disappointing, at 68.4dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms, though when A-weighted this did improve to 82.8dB left and 79.3dB right. Fig.5 reveals that the noise floor is dominated by spuriae at the AC mains frequency of 60Hz and its harmonics.Fig.5 Unison Unico Primo, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.6 reveals that the Unico Primo exceeded its specified maximum output power of 80Wpc into 8 ohms  , clipping   at 105Wpc  . However, into 4 ohms  , the output voltage dropped, the amplifier clipping at 135Wpc  , which suggests that its power transformer is undersized. While performing this test, I noted that at levels above 20W or so the transformer audibly buzzed, which suggests the same thing. These two graphs indicate that the THD+N level remains relatively constant over a wide range of powers, from 100mW to 10W, but that the amplifier becomes more linear as the output current increases.Fig.6 Unison Unico Primo, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Unison Unico Primo, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I plotted how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a level, 8.95V  , where I could be sure that I was examining actual distortion rather than noise. The results are plotted in  .8: The rise in THD in the top two octaves is lower than usual, suggesting that the circuit has a wide open-loop bandwidth. The distortion also remains relatively constant over the range of impedances.Fig.8 Unison Unico Primo, THD+N   vs frequency at 8.95V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The distortion signature at 1kHz and low powers appears primarily to be third-harmonic in nature  , but at higher powers, the second harmonic and higher-order odd harmonics make appearances  . The graph of intermodulation distortion   looks a little alarming, but other than the products at 18 and 21kHz, the spuriae are all at or below 70dB  .Fig.9 Unison Unico Primo, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.1% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Unison Unico Primo, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 20W into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 Unison Unico Primo, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 40W peak into 4 ohms  .Some of its measured behavior suggests that some corners have been cut to keep the Unison Research Unico Primos price relatively affordable. But despite its disappointing levels of noise and distortion, the Unico Primo appears to maintain a relatively constant level of performance over a wide range of frequencies and power levels, which is always found subjectively to be a good thing.

       " '  darTZeel NHB-108 model two  —see the January 2008 As We See It. I performed the measurements using the balanced   and single-ended   inputs and left the internal jumpers as they had been set. To avoid triggering the amplifiers protection circuitry, I turned it off before changing the inputs during the measurements.   Before starting the testing, I followed the CEAs recommendation by preconditioning the amplifier for 30 minutes at one-eighth the maximum power into 8 ohms. At the end of that time, the side-mounted heatsinks were hot, at 113.3°F  . After an additional 10 minutes at one-third power into 8 ohms, the heatsink temperature had risen to 121.6°F  . The NHB-108 model two needs to be well-ventilated.The darTZeels voltage gain into 8 ohms was a low 20.15dB from the balanced inputs, but as with the NHB-468 monoblock that Michael Fremer reviewed in November 2019, the unbalanced gain was 6dB higher. The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   for both XLR and RCA inputs. The balanced and unbalanced input impedances are specified as >30k ohms; I measured 20k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz for the balanced inputs, which is still usefully high, and 24k ohms for the unbalanced inputs at 20Hz and 1kHz, 16k ohms at 20kHz.Although the NHB-108 model twos output impedance is specified as <0.33 ohms, my estimate, including the series impedance of 6 of spaced-pair cable, was slightly higher, at 0.435 ohms at 20Hz, 0.455 ohms at 1kHz, and 0.465 ohms at 20kHz. Consequently, the frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±0.26dB  . The audioband response into impedances of 2 ohms and above was flat up to 20kHz, and the output into 8 ohms   was down by just 0.5dB at 200kHz. As with the other darTZeel amplifiers that have been reviewed in Stereophile, the NHB-108 model two has a wide small-signal bandwidth; its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   featured very short risetimes and no overshoot or ringing.Fig.1 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The darTZeels wideband, unweighted S/N ratio, ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms and measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground, was an excellent 86.7dB in the left channel and 81.4dB in the right. These ratios improved to a superb 99.4dB and 95.5dB, respectively, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 101.8dB and 99.1dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the darTZeels noisefloor   revealed that the spuriae related to the power-line frequency were all very low in level. The levels of these spuriae didnt change when I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and analyzer.Fig.3 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .The NHB-108 model twos maximum power is specified as 150W into 8 ohms   and 225W into 4 ohms  . With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%, the darTZeel with both channels driven slightly exceeded its specified powers into both impedances. It clipped at 155Wpc into 8 ohms   and at 230Wpc into 4 ohms  . The NHB-108 model twos maximum power is not specified into 2 ohms; I didnt test the amplifiers maximum power into that load, as I broke the original version when I attempted to do so.Fig.4 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I measured how the darTZeel amplifiers THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a fairly high level, 20V, which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms and 100W into 4 ohms. Though the distortion is relatively high in level into both impedances,  .6 reveals that the NHB-108s distortion doesnt increase with frequency, which is commendable considering that the NHB-108 model two has no global negative feedback.Fig.6 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, THD+N   vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The waveform of the residual distortion and noise with a 1kHz signal at 50W into 8 ohms   is smooth, which English audio engineer Ben Duncan has suggested correlates with good sound quality. This graph suggests that the subjectively benign second harmonic is dominant, which was confirmed by spectral analysis with a 50Hz tone  , though higher-order harmonics are present at lower levels. Other than a proportional increase in the levels of the harmonics when I repeated this analysis at the same voltage into 4 ohms, the spectrum was identical  .Fig.7 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms, 0.118% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 50Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100Wpc into 4 ohms  .I then looked at the amplifiers output spectrum as I reduced the level in stages down to 1Wpc into 8 ohms. As you can see from  .10, though the higher-order harmonics progressively disappear as the power is reduced, the level of the second harmonic remains constant at around –60dB  . Repeating this series of spectral analyses at different signal frequencies gave the same result. The NHB-108 model twos distortion signature is independent of input frequency and output voltage; while the level of the distortion products increases as the output current increase, this distortion signature doesnt change.Fig.10 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .It was only when I performed my usual high-frequency intermodulation test with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones that the NHB-108 model two stumbled a little. With a peak signal level of 50W into 8 ohms, the second-order difference product lay at –60dB  . Although many higher-order products can be seen, almost all of these lie at or below –80dB  .Fig.11 darTZeel NHB-108 model two, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .The darTZeel NHB-108 model twos measured performance is very similar to that of the original version of the amplifier, which John Marks and Wes Phillips favorably reviewed in September 2003 and April 2005, respectively. Yes, the distortion is relatively high in level, which will be due to the designers decision not to use any global negative feedback. But I keep coming back to the independence of the amplifiers transfer function from the input signal. I have long felt that this behavior is related to good sound quality. I will be interested to read what JVS thought of the darTZeels sound.           ',\n",
       " '  Audio Research VSi60s measured performance with Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain. I checked the bias of each output tube after letting the amplifier warm up for an hour and before I did any testing. All the tubes had exactly 60mV of bias, as specified, and didnt need adjustment with the top-panel potentiometers, which suggests good stability.I had one mishap during the testing: I was measuring the amplifiers clipping power from the 4 ohm output transformer tap into 16 ohms and, just as the waveform squared, there was a loud bang. I immediately pulled out the AC lead and took the cover off. The 100 ohm wire-wound plate resistor for one of the left channels 6550 output tubes had exploded. No fuses had blown! The other channel was okay, as was the same tubes 1 ohm cathode resistor. Audio Research sent me a replacement tube and resistor, which I installed  , though not to the same standard of neat soldering typical of the Minnesota companys products. The repaired left channel measured the same as the undamaged right channel, and offered the same signal/noise ratio as it had before the accident. I continued with the remaining tests, the harmonic and intermodulation spectra.The VSi60 offered a maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms of 32.65dB from the 8 ohm tap, and 29.9dB from the 4 ohm tap. Though these gains are lower than usual for an integrated amplifier, in my opinion theyre optimal for CD sources. The unity-gain setting of the volume control was between the third and fourth green LEDs on the front-panel thermometer display. The VSi60 preserved absolute polarity   through all the inputs and from both output taps. Its input impedance was usefully high, at 51k ohms, in the midrange and below, decreasing slightly, to 37k ohms, at 20kHz. The subwoofer output appeared to be full-range, meaning that it should be used with a subwoofer that has its own low-pass input filter.As expected for an amplifier using a single pair of 6550 tubes per channel, the output impedance was moderately high in the bass and midrange, at 2.5 ohms from the 8 ohm tap and 1.6 ohms from the 4 ohm tap. The impedance rose at 20kHz, to 3 and 2.16 ohms, from the 8 and 4 ohm taps, respectively. This highish source impedance gave rise to ±1.4dB response variations from the 8 ohm tap into the magazines standard simulated loudspeaker  , while the increase in source impedance at high frequencies resulted in a premature top-octave rolloff of –2dB at 20kHz into 2 ohms  . The responses from the 4 ohm tap were similar, but with less variation in response due to different load impedances, as expected  .Fig.1 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , volume control maximum.  Fig.2 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  , volume control maximum.  If you look closely at the traces in  .1, you can see a slight knee at 50kHz. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; at lower settings of the volume control, the knee became a little more pronounced  , which implies the existence of some sort of parasitic resonance, which in turn results in a couple of cycles of well-damped ringing on the tops and bottoms of a 10kHz squarewave  . The 4 ohm tap was better behaved in this respect. The amplifiers reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave was superbly square  .Fig.3 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms with volume control at 12:00   and at its maximum  .  Fig.4 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 2kHz and still 78dB at 20kHz. The amplifiers noise floor, assessed with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum, was also fairly low in level. The unweighted, wideband S/N ratio   was a good 73.3 and 74.8dB for both channels from the 8 and 4 ohm taps, respectively. The audioband ratios were 5 and 3dB better, while A-weighting the measurement gave 89dB from the 8 ohm tap and 90dB from the 4 ohm tap.Plotting the THD+noise percentage in the VSi60s output against power revealed that the distortion began to rise above the noise floor at levels above 1–2W from the 8 ohm tap  , and at levels above 500mW–1W from the 4 ohm tap  . The linear increase above those levels before actual waveform clipping suggests that the circuit uses a low amount of loop negative feedback  . ARC specifies the VSi60s maximum power at 1.5% THD. The amplifier exceeds that specification from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms, with 53Wpc available   at 1% THD, though only 44W   were available from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms at 1% THD. The amplifier did meet its 50W specification   from the 4 ohm tap at 6% THD; however, the 0.6dB shortfall in power will be inconsequential.Fig.6 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 16, 8, 4 ohms.Fig.7 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 16, 8, 4, 2 ohms.Provided the speaker load is equal to or greater than the nominal value of the VSi60s output transformer tap, the distortion at a level equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms remains below 0.1% in the midrange and below  , though with a rise in THD in the upper audio octaves. The distortion is predominantly the subjectively innocuous low-order harmonics, even at moderate power levels  . However,  .11 indicates that the amplifiers power supply is working hard, with the fundamental and third-order harmonics of the 60Hz AC power frequency almost as high in level as the distortion harmonics, particularly in the right channel  . The 120Hz component lies at –96dB in this graph  , suggesting that the circuit benefits from optimal grounding.Fig.8 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 6.3V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.9 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 3.9V into: 16 ohms  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.10 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 13.7W into 4 ohms  , 0.175% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Audio Research VSi60, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .These odd-order power-supply harmonics led to sidebands to either side of the two signal components in the spectrum of the VSi60s output while it reproduced an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a level close to visual clipping on the oscilloscope screen  . As anticipated from the circuits decreasing linearity in the top audio octave, the 1kHz difference tone in this graph is moderately high in level, at –60dB  , and reaches –50dB   at 19W peak from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . The higher-order intermodulation products are all lower in level, however.Fig.12 Audio Research VSi60, 8 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 25W peak into 8 ohms  .To a large extent, the Audio Research VSi60s measurements are much as I would have expected from a tube amplifier using a single pair of 6550 output tubes per channel, with low loop negative feedback, and offering the sizes of power supply and output transformers that are possible at its price. But its nicely engineered for all that. Just make sure you use the appropriate output transformer tap for your loudspeakers.           ',\n",
       " '  Octave Audio V 80 SE using my top-of-the-line   system  . Measurements were taken with the Octaves rear-panel switch set to High Power, as recommended for the KT150 output-stage tubes.   After warming up the amplifier for an hour, I checked the bias for each of the four output tubes, using the central LED array and the right-hand rotary switch on the front panel. All tubes were correctly biased for KT150s, with the red and green LEDs illuminated for each tube.The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the speaker terminals into 8 ohms measured 38.75dB for both the unbalanced and balanced inputs. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLRs being wired with pin 2 hot. When I switched the amplifier to Extern mode, which separates the V 80 SEs preamplifier and power-amplifier sections, the gain at the preamplifier output jacks was 0dB rather than the specified 12dB; ie, all the voltage gain was being supplied by the power-amplifier stage, which also includes the volume control. At the rear-panel headphone jack, the maximum gain was 24.6dB. The balanced input impedance was a high 26k ohms across the audioband; the unbalanced input impedance was 39k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 33k ohms at 20kHz.The preamplifier sections output impedance was a low 5 ohms across the audioband; that from the headphone jack was 19 ohms, which will be too high for low-impedance phones. Measured at the speaker terminals, the output impedance was fairly high, measuring 1.84 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising to 3.1 ohms at 20kHz. As a result, the variation in the V 80 SEs frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker was ±1.1dB  . The other traces in this graph show the response into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. Note the excellent matching between channels but also the slight peak just above 40kHz. With a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  , this peak correlates with a small degree of overshoot on the waveforms leading edges, followed by a single cycle of damped ringing. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; there was no difference in response at lower settings, and the excellent channel balance was preserved. From the headphone output, the frequency response was flat to 30kHz, and down by 3dB at 140kHz  .Fig.1 Octave Audio V 80 SE, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Octave Audio V 80 SE, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was good rather than great, at 69dB R–L and 74dB L–R at 2kHz, decreasing to 48 and 57dB, respectively, at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, ref. 1W into 8 ohms with the input shorted but the volume control set to its maximum—the worst-case situation—was very good, at 79.1dB left and 78.25dB right. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband improved these ratios to 82.6 and 81.7dB, respectively, while switching in an A-weighting filter gave respective ratios of 87.3 and 87.9dB. Fig.3 shows the low-frequency spectrum of the V 80 SEs output as it drove a 1kHz sinewave at 1W into 8 ohms. AC-supply–related components can be seen in both channels, though all the spuriae lie at a low level in absolute terms, and the 120Hz-related components are lower in the left channel than in the right.Fig.3 Octave Audio V 80 SE, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 4 and 5 show how the THD+noise percentage in the V 80 SEs output varied with power into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. Octave specifies the maximum power into 4 ohms with KT150 tubes as 120Wpc  , and  .5 reveals that, with both channels operating, the amplifier just reached this power at 3% distortion. At our usual definition of clipping  , the amplifier gave 43.3Wpc into 4 ohms   and 79Wpc into 8 ohms  . Though the THD+N is very low below 1W into either load, the steady rise in THD with power in both graphs suggests that only a modest degree of loop negative feedback is used. The headphone output clipped at 9V into 300 ohms, which will be more than sufficient drive capability with typical high-impedance cans.Fig.4 Octave Audio V 80 SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms  .Fig.5 Octave Audio V 80 SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms  .I didnt test the Octave amplifiers clipping power into 2 ohms, as the V 80 SE was not comfortable driving a load that low. This can be seen in  .6, which shows how the THD+N percentage varies with frequency: at 6.33V, which is equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms  , 10W into 4 ohms  , and 20W into 2 ohms  . However, into higher impedances, the rise in THD at low frequencies is modest, implying that the V 80 SEs output transformer has a hefty core. The rise in THD at the other end of the audioband is also relatively modest for a push-pull amplifier with a single pair of output tubes and limited loop negative feedback.Fig.6 Octave Audio V 80 SE, THD+N   vs frequency at 6.33V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, the nature of the distortion is heavily third-harmonic  , which will be relatively innocuous. At low frequencies at moderate powers, the second harmonic is almost as high as the third  : the second lies at –60dB  , the third at –54dB  . At moderate powers, the V 80 SE produced a low level of intermodulation products when driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones  , the 1kHz difference product lying at –69dB  ; still, the higher-order products are higher in level, particularly in the left channel  .Fig.7 Octave Audio V 80 SE, 1kHz waveform at 8W into 8 ohms  , 0.206% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Octave Audio V 80 SE, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 8W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Octave Audio V 80 SE, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 8W peak into 8 ohms  .Although the rear-panel phono input jacks were marked \"MC Phono,\" our review sample of the V 80 SE was fitted with a moving-magnet stage. The gain at 1kHz, measured at the preamplifier output jacks  , was appropriate for MM cartridges at 40.4dB, as was the input impedance, which ranged from 45k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz to 21.5k ohms at 20kHz. The phono stage preserved absolute polarity. The RIAA error is shown in  .10; the two channels match closely, but there is a small peak 0.75dB high between 30 and 40Hz before the output rapidly rolls off, reaching –3dB at 18Hz. At the other end of the spectrum, the response is down by 3dB at 63kHz.Fig.10 Octave Audio V 80 SE, phono-stage response with RIAA correction    .Channel separation via the phono input   was very good, at 80dB R–L and 90dB L–R at 2kHz, decreasing to 65 and 60dB, respectively, at 20kHz. The phono signal/noise ratios were also very good, at 70dB  , 75dB  , and 82.4dB  , all ref.1kHz at 5mV and taken with the inputs shorted to ground.The Octaves phono stage also featured very low distortion.  spectrum with a 1kHz tone at 20mV input, 12dB higher than the standard MM level of 5mV and equivalent to an output at the preamplifier jacks of 2V. Even so, as can be seen in  .11, the only distortion harmonic that can be seen above the low noise floor is the second, at –110dB  ! Intermodulation distortion   was higher in level; nevertheless, the difference product at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lay at –66dB  . The phono overload margins, ref. 1kHz at 5mV, were superb, at 28dB at 20Hz, 26dB at 1kHz, and still 14dB at 20kHz.Fig.11 Octave Audio V 80 SE, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 2V into 100k ohms  .As I was with the other Octave Audio amplifiers we have reviewed  , I was impressed by the V 80 SEs measured performance.

       " '  First Watt J2,    .  ,   J2 by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour.   At the end of the hour, the heatsinks were hot, at 125.6°F  , though the top panel was a little cooler, at 113.3°F  .The First Watts voltage gain into 8 ohms measured a lower-than-average 19.5dB from both its balanced and unbalanced inputs, and both inputs preserved absolute polarity  . The unbalanced input impedance measured the specified 100k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still high 65k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was a consistent 208k ohms across the audioband.The output impedance was relatively high for a solid-state design, at 0.5 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±0.35dB  . This graph, taken with a balanced input  , shows that the audioband response is flat into 8 ohms  , with the ultrasonic rolloff reaching –1.5dB at 100kHz. The response rolled off a little earlier with lower impedances, but even into 2 ohms, the response was down by just 0.25dB at 20kHz  . The J2 reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with short risetimes, and no overshoot or ringing  .Fig.1 First Watt J2, balanced frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 First Watt J2, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was excellent, at >100dB in both directions below 3kHz, and still 80dB at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the input shorted to ground, was a respectable 84.1dB  , which improved to 88.3dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 99.75dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the J2s noise floor   revealed spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics, which will be due to a non-zero impedance to ground; and at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, which will be due to magnetic interference from the AC power transformer. All of these spuriae are very low in level, however, and will not be audible.Fig.3 First Watt J2, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%,  .4 reveals that the J2 clipped at 25Wpc into 8 ohms  , with a gentle rise in THD+N below that power. Unusually, but as specified, the J2 delivers less power into 4 ohms  , clipping at 12.5Wpc  . In general, while the First Watt offers low levels of distortion into 8 ohms, it is less comfortable into lower impedance. This is shown graphically in  .6, which plots the percentage of THD+N into 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms  .Fig.4 First Watt J2, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 First Watt J2, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 First Watt J2, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fortunately, and as specified by the J2s designer, Nelson Pass, its distortion into higher impedances is primarily the sonically benign second harmonic  , though the third harmonic becomes stronger into 4 ohms, and is accompanied in the left channel by some higher odd-order harmonics  . Intermodulation distortion into higher impedances was also low  , with the second-order difference component at 1kHz lying at –74dB  . Into 4 ohms, this component rose by 10dB to 0.06%  —but again, the left channel   appears less linear than the right   into this lower impedance, with higher levels of higher-order intermodulation products.Fig.7 First Watt J2, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.035% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 First Watt J2, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 First Watt J2, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2W into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 First Watt J2, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 First Watt J2, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 2W peak into 4 ohms  .Other than the slightly worse linearity of the left channel into lower impedances, the First Watt J2 measured well. But its measured performance does suggest that owners not use it with speakers that drop below 4 ohms. But as HR found, with higher-impedance speakers, the J2 will sing!           ',\n",
       " 'I initially measured one of the Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression Mono monoblocks      .   of a power amplifier, I precondition it by running it at one-third its specified power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes. This power level results in the highest thermal stress on the output devices of an amplifier having a class-B or class-AB output stage. After an hour driving 167W into 8 ohms, the temperature of the Progressions top panel and heatsinks was fairly high, at 109.8°F  . With the amplifier cold, the THD+noise at this power level was 0.04%; after the hour, it had dropped to 0.025%.The voltage gain into 8 ohms for the balanced input was 29.7dB, and the input preserved absolute polarity, the XLR jack being wired with pin 2 hot. The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was as specified, at 100k ohms, though it dropped inconsequentially at 20kHz, to 70k ohms. The output impedance was high for a solid-state design, at 0.44 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.49 ohm at 20kHz. Consequently, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±0.3dB  . The amplifier offered a wide small-signal bandwidth, the output into 8 ohms   not reaching –3dB until 180kHz. Consequently, the Progressions reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured very short risetimes with, commendably, no overshoot or ringing apparent.Fig.1 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W   and at 100W   into 8 ohms  .Measured with the input shorted to ground, the Progression offered a wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio of 57.5dB, ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This was primarily due to the presence of noise with a center frequency of 923kHz. Concerned that the amplifier was picking up some RF interference that was being demodulated, I turned off all the CFC and LED lights in my test lab, but the noise persisted. The ratio improved to 80.1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 87dB when the reading was A-weighted. The blue trace in  .3, taken at 1W into 8 ohms, reveals that the primary source of noise is magnetic interference at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, presumably stemming from that massive toroidal transformer. However, at higher powers  , the spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics increase in level.When I measured how the percentage of THD+N varies with output power into 8 ohms and 4 ohms, I got lower power than specified. With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+N reaches 1%, the Progression clipped at 460W into 8 ohms  , which is 0.4dB lower than the specified 500W, and 690W into 4 ohms  , this 1.6dB lower than the specified 1kW into this load. When I tried to test the clipping power into 2 ohms, the amplifier turned itself off at 750W and just before then, I could hear the amplifier acoustically buzzing, and a burst of static through the FM radio I keep tuned to NPR in the test lab.When Dan DAgostino received the initial preprint of this review, he was concerned that this behavior indicated that the amplifier had suffered some sort of damage on its way to me from Jason Serinus.   I was therefore sent a new sample of the Progression Mono  , which had been fully checked out on the test bench, to test.The voltage gain, input impedance, and frequency response of this sample were identical to those of the first, though the output impedance was slightly lower, at 0.32 ohms, and there was no RF noise present at the amplifiers output. And when I examined how the percentage of THD+N varies with output power, this sample clipped at 595W into 8 ohms  , which is 0.8dB higher than the 500W specification. Into 4 ohms, the clipping power was 934W  ; though this is 0.3dB lower than the specification, I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests, feeling that this is more representative of an amplifiers behavior in a typical system. The wall voltage was 120.1V with the amplifier idling, but had dropped to 115.4V at 934W into 4 ohms.Fig.4 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.I examined how the THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a fairly high level, 28.3V, which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms and 200W into 4 ohms.   The results are shown in  .6: the distortion and noise remain low over most of the audioband, with only relatively small rises in the top octave and into lower impedances. However, when  waveform of the THD+N after notching out the fundamental  , I was surprised. Although the THD+N is low in this graph, at 0.027%, you can see a double spike in the residual waveform   that coincides with every zero-crossing point in the signals waveform  . This behavior suggests that the Progressions output stage lacks sufficient bias current, something that I find surprising given Dan DAgostinos history of designing amplifiers with high, even class-A bias.Fig.6 Dan DAgostino Progression, THD+N   vs frequency at 28.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.027% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 100W into 8 ohms; a regular series of high-order harmonics can be seen, correlating with the waveform of the spuriae shown in  .7. The second and third harmonics are similar in strength in this graph, respectively lying at –76dB   and –80dB  . The harmonic spectrum was almost identical with the amplifier driving 50Hz into 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Although the THD+N percentage didnt rise by a great deal at high frequencies, the Progression performed relatively poorly when  spectrum of its output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 100W  . While it is true that none of the intermodulation products is particularly high in level—the difference product at 1kHz lies at a respectable –80dB  —an alarming number of higher-order intermodulation products is visible in this graph. These all disappeared, however, when I reduced the peak level to 1W  .Fig.9 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Dan DAgostino Progression Mono, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms  .The Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression Mono is a powerful amplifier indeed, and the measured performance of the second sample does suggest that the first sample I received had somehow suffered during its travels. I was still puzzled by what appeared to be crossover distortion. However, it is fair to note that the Progression Mono measured very similarly to Dan DAgostinos more expensive Momentum monoblock, which Michael Fremer very favorably reviewed in February 2013 and which I declared to be \"well-engineered.\"           ',\n",
       " '  Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, I mostly used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  ; for some tests, I also used my vintage Audio Precision System One Dual Domain.The VK-55SE has four output terminals for each channel, various pairs of which can be used to provide a feed from three different output-transformer taps: these are labeled \"High  ,\" \"Med  ,\" and \"Low  .\" I performed a complete set of measurements from each tap, but have concentrated on the High and Low outputs in this discussion, as the Med  output was not that different from the High in most respects.The amplifiers maximum voltage gain was lower than usual, at 24dB into 8 ohms from the High and Med outputs and 23dB from the Low, though there was a little more experimental error in these  ures than usual because of a slight history effect; ie, the actual gain somewhat depended on the signal behavior. When I increased the signal level of a sinewave tone, for example, the level of the output signal drifted down by a few millivolts over a period of several seconds before stabilizing at the new steady-state value. Each output tap was non-inverting  , with pin 2 of the XLR jacks wired hot. The input impedance was very high—a good thing—at 250k ohms at 1kHz, increasing slightly at the frequency extremes.As with the standard VK-55  , the output impedance from the VK-55SEs High and Med taps was high, at 2.7 ohms in the midrange, rising to almost 3 ohms at high and low frequencies. As expected, the output impedance was somewhat lower from the Low tap, at just under 2 ohms at high and midrange frequencies, with only a slight rise, to 2.1 ohms, at 20Hz. As a result of the Ohms Law interaction between the high output impedances with the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, the amplifiers frequency response into this load varied by ±1.7dB from the Med and High taps   and ±1.2dB from the Low tap  . These variations in response will be audible. Into resistive loads, the VK-55SE offered a flat response in the audioband, with excellent channel matching and a wide small-signal bandwidth. Even into 2 ohms  , the ultrasonic response didnt reach –3dB until 90kHz, which results in a very square squarewave response  . The waveforms risetimes are very short and, commendably, there is only a slight hint of overshoot and no ringing. The VK-55SE uses well-made output transformers.Fig.1 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.2 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .  Fig.3 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was superb at >100dB in both directions below 3kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the input shorted, was good at 78.7dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms, improving to 96.5dB when A-weighted. The  ures were taken from the Low output; the Med and High outputs were about 0.8dB worse.Specified as having a maximum output power of 55Wpc into 8 ohms  , the VK-55SE delivered exactly this power into 8 ohms from its High tap at 1% THD+noise, as can be seen in  .4, which plots the THD+N percentage against output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms from this tap. The 4 ohms delivery was the same, while into 2 ohms, this tap delivered 38W  . The steady rise in THD with power before actual waveform clipping is reached suggests that this amplifier uses only a modest amount of loop negative feedback. The Med tap delivered slightly more power at 1% THD+N into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , but the same 38W into 4 ohms. Fig.5 plots the THD+N percentage against output power from the Low tap. The low-level distortion is lower than from the other two taps, and though less power is available at clipping into 8 ohms—40Wpc, 16dBW—this tap does behave a little more like a voltage source, with 64W available into 4 ohms and 59W into 2 ohms  . The Low tap will be the one to use with loudspeakers that offer an awkward impedance, such as the Thiel CS3.7s used by Wes Phillips for some of his auditioning.Fig.4 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.Fig.5 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into  : 8, 4, 2 ohms.The two channels differed in their small-signal linearity and noise level, perhaps because the review samples tubes had much mileage on them. For example,  s. 6 and 7 plot the THD+N percentage against frequency from the High and Low taps, respectively. The right channel   offered lower distortion+noise in the midrange and treble than the left  . However, while the left and right channels were not significantly different at low frequencies from the High tap, the left channel offered significantly less distortion below 100Hz than the right from the Low tap.Fig.6 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .This can be seen in  .8, which shows the spectrum of the VK-55SEs Low-tap output at a modest power into 8 ohms. A regular series of both odd- and even-order harmonics can be seen, but these are each about 12dB lower in the left channel   than the right  . If this spectrum had been predominantly odd-order harmonics, I would have suspected an undersized core in the right-channel transformer, but as the highest-level harmonic is the second, perhaps it was due to a tube mismatch. At higher frequencies and lower levels, the third harmonic dominates  .Fig.8 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, High output tap, 1kHz waveform at 3.4W into 4 ohms  , 0.248% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Finally, as implied by the fact that the distortion percentage doesnt rise at the top of the audioband in  s. 6 and 7, the VK-55SE did quite well on the demanding twin-tone high-frequency intermodulation test  . At a level from the Low tap just below visible clipping on the oscilloscope screen, the 1kHz difference tone was the highest in level, at –57dB  , though a series of higher-order products can also be seen at lower levels. The higher-frequency tones were surrounded by sideband pairs at ±120Hz and its harmonics, suggesting that the amplifiers power supply is being stressed under these conditions, even though the actual 120Hz component lies at a low –95dB.  Fig.10 Balanced Audio Technology VK-55SE, Low output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 20W peak into 8 ohms  .Overall, the VK-55SE is as well engineered as I have come to expect from Balanced Audio Technology. Certainly it sounds as good as WP describes, as I found out when I drove, from its Low output-transformer tap, the Aerial Model 20Tv2 loudspeakers currently residing in my listening room. But some aspects of the VK-55SEs measured performance bothered me, particularly the difference between the channels low-frequency linearity from the Low tap—and it is only fair to point out that the SE measures no better than the plain-Jane VK-55.

       " 'As mentioned by Wes Phillips, its generous output stage bias causes the NHB-108 to run hot. After the preconditioning period of running at one-third power into 8 ohms, its chassis and heatsink were very hot.  The amplifier is very fussy about how it is used. Turning it on without a load attached blows the 6.3A fast-blo fuses, as does unplugging an input jack. Several times during the testing I inadvertently blew fuses, and got quite proficient in replacing them, even though the fuseholders are hard to reach and manipulate, given their placement inside the chassis adjacent to each power transformer.Unusually, there were DC offsets present on the review samples output terminals. With the NHB-108s input short-circuited, I measured 98.5mV on the left channel, 115mV on the right. The manufacturer hand-trims each amplifier before shipping; as this sample had seen a lot of travel over the past two years, its possible that its DC operating points had gone out of alignment.  I did a complete set of measurements with the NHB-108 set to its Hi condition, with some follow-ups set to Lo. The voltage gain at the Hi and Lo settings was 26.3dB into 8 ohms, absolutely normal, and the amplifier was noninverting; ie, it preserved absolute polarity. The XLR jacks on this sample input were simply connected in parallel with the unbalanced RCA jacks; current production, Im told, has true transformer-coupled balanced inputs in addition to the unbalanced and 50 ohm Zeel inputs. The RCA jacks offered a higher-than-specified input impedance, at 220k ohms at 1kHz, dropping to 110k ohms at 20kHz.   As a result, the NHB-108 will not load down preamplifiers.The NHB-108 lacks overall negative feedback. According to the designer, the only feedback in the input stage is degenerative  , while the output stage is \"full open-loop, with no feedback at all, no emitter resistor, no serial inductance whatsoever.\" A small, local, symmetrical feedback is wrapped around the middle, second stage, but there is no feedback path from the output to the input. Amplifiers lacking overall loop negative feedback can have high output impedances. However, the NHB-108 measured quite well in this regard, the source impedance remaining around 0.34 ohm across the audioband. As a result, the modification of the amplifiers frequency response by the Ohms Law interaction between its source impedance and the impedance of our simulated loudspeaker load   stayed within respectable ±0.3dB limits.Fig.1 darTZeel NHB-108, frequency response at 2.83V into  : simulated loudspeaker load, 8 ohms, 4 ohms  .Into resistive loads, the measured small-signal response   revealed a very wide bandwidth, with the amplifiers output down by just 1dB at 148kHz.   As a result, the NHB-108s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave was superb, with small risetimes and an absence of overshoot and ringing  .Fig.2 darTZeel NHB-108, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.One thing I noted during the measurements was that after an abrupt change in load impedance, the amplifiers output level continued changing very slightly, settling asymptotically on its new steady-state value. I also noticed this phenomenon with Ayres AX-7 amplifier  , which resembles the darTZeel in not having an overall feedback loop.The darTZeels channel separation was excellent, at 95dB L–R and 100dB R–L. But this is still a higher level of crosstalk than I was expecting from the amplifiers physically dual-mono construction.   Perhaps the need with this early-production sample to connect the two channels speaker ground terminals introduces some small degree of crosstalk. One reason I could see this low level of crosstalk on my oscilloscope screen was because the NHB-108s noise floor was superbly low. Referenced to an output level of 1W into 8 ohms, the A-weighted signal/noise ratio was 91.4dB. Even with a wideband, unweighted measurement, the S/N was 76.5dB.Again due to its lack of loop negative feedback, the NHB-108 is not a low-distortion design. Fig.3 plots the level of THD and noise present in its output   as the output power rises from 100mW to clipping   into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The distortion level at low powers is relatively high and almost doubles with each halving of the load impedance. Even so, the amplifiers linearity remains reasonably constant over a wide range of output power, meaning that the circuits operating conditions will not be modulated by the signal. Clipping occurs quite abruptly, but the amplifier easily exceeds its specified 100Wpc/20dBW output power. I measured 160W into 8 ohms  , 230W into 4 ohms  , but 162W into 2 ohms  . The manufacturer strongly recommends using the Lo setting if the amplifier is to be used with low impedances. However, the amplifier then delivers significantly lower power at clipping—43W into 8 ohms  , 68W into 4 ohms  , and 95W into 2 ohms  —with no reduction in low-power THD.Fig.3 darTZeel NHB-108, Hi setting, distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power with one channel driven into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms.The distortion, though relatively high, also remained constant with frequency, as can be seen in  .4. Of more subjective importance than the absolute level of distortion present in an amplifiers output is its harmonic spectrum, and here the NHB-108 did well. As can be seen in  .5, the distortion is predominantly low-order harmonics. At low powers, the subjectively benign second harmonic was dominant; at higher powers, the third became dominant  .Fig.4 darTZeel NHB-108, Hi setting, THD+N  vs frequency at 2.83V into  : 8 ohms, 4 ohms, 2 ohms  .Fig.5 darTZeel NHB-108, Hi setting, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  , 0.165% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.6 darTZeel NHB-108, Hi setting, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 55W into 8 ohms  .At that point I still had one more measurement to perform, the high-frequency intermodulation test, in which I drive the amplifier being tested with an equal mix of 19kHz and 20kHz tones and turn up the signal until the amplifier just clips. I then reduce the level by a couple of dB and perform a spectral analysis of the amplifiers output signal, to see what tones are present other than the original 19kHz and 20kHz components under these very demanding conditions.Unfortunately, when I approached clipping with this signal, a click emanated from the NHB-108, which I assume was the crowbar protection circuit cutting in. Before I could reach over and tug the AC cord loose, there was a loud bang from the left-channel output devices and my test lab filled with blue smoke. Once my ears had stopped ringing, it turned out that, when Id last replaced the fuses, I had inadvertently used a slo-blo type for the left channel. When the crowbar circuit operated, the right-channel fast-blo fuse had blown as required, protecting the output stage. Unfortunately, the left channels devices blew up to protect the fuse!The NHB-108s measured performance indicates that, with the exception of its slightly bent transfer function, designer Hervé Delétraz has avoided the problem most commonly associated with the absence of the usual overall negative-feedback loop. But that highish DC level and the hair-trigger crowbar protection make it difficult for me to recommend on a general basis. The darTZeel NHB-108 is like a Shelby Cobra—a handbuilt, high-performance design that makes demands on its always gratified owner, rather than a plugnplay, never-very-gratifying Ford Taurus. But given that caveat, I was impressed by the NHB-108, and my own auditioning echoes that of both Wes Phillips and John Marks: I found it a very sweet-sounding amplifier.           ',\n",
       " 'The VAC Sigma 170i iQ uses two pairs of Gold Lion KT88 tubes for its output stages and eight small-signal tubes. The tubes are identified with a number, this between the pins of the small-signal tubes. The tube locations are clearly indicated in the manual and the top panel has each tube socket marked with the appropriate tube number. I carefully followed the numbering when installing the tubes before connecting the amplifier first to my    , then to the magazines higher-performance APx555 analyzer in order to repeat some of the tests. The condition-monitoring LEDs for the four KT88s remained dark throughout the testing, indicating that these tubes were operating correctly. The output transformer taps are marked \"8–16,\" \"4–8,\" and \"2–4.\" I performed a complete series of tests from each of the three taps using the single-ended line-level inputs then repeated some of the tests using the balanced inputs.The Sigma 170i iQs unbalanced input impedance was a high 44.7k ohms at 20Hz, dropping to a still-high 33k ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was slightly greater than twice the unbalanced impedance across the audioband. The 170i iQ inverted absolute polarity with both sets of inputs from all three transformer taps and from the preamplifier outputs. The amplifiers maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms depended on the output tap. The highest gain was from the 8–16 ohm tap, at 48.1dB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs. The gain from the 4–8 ohm tap was 47.8dB, and from the 2–4 ohm tap it was 46.4dB. These gains are somewhat higher than usually found in integrated amplifiers. The gain at the preamplifier output was 21.6dB, sourced from a low output impedance of 340 ohms at high and middle frequencies but from a high 3154 ohms in the low bass.The amplifiers output impedance depended on the output tap. From the 8–16 ohm tap, the impedance was an extremely high 8.8 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping very slightly to 8 ohms at 20kHz. The VAC amplifier appears to adhere to telecommunications practice, where the output impedance is similar in value to the load impedance. This results in maximum power transfer to the load, but as can be seen from the gray trace in  .1, it also results in large and very audible ±3.5dB variations in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker. The variations in response were reduced to ±2.1dB with the 4–8 ohm tap—which had an output impedance of 4.4 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 4 ohms at 20kHz—and to ±1.2dB from the 2–4 ohm tap  . This tap had an output impedance of 2.2 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 1.95 ohms at 20kHz.Fig.1 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 2–4 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .The small-signal bandwidth is wide and flat to 20kHz into resistive loads from all three transformer taps  , though two ultrasonic resonances can be seen. These were highest in level when the load impedance was lower than the nominal tap value. This behavior is associated with a small amount of overshoot and ringing with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . At lower frequencies, the amplifiers reproduction of squarewaves had flat tops and bottoms, confirming the Sigma 170i iQs extended low frequencies.Fig.3 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum. The channel matching was within 0.2dB and didnt change at lower settings of the volume control. Channel separation was not as good as I expected, at 60dB, L–R, and 68dB, R–L, below 2kHz, and the  ures reduced to 35dB and 49dB, respectively, at the top of the audioband.Measured at the 8–16 ohm taps and taken with the inputs shorted to ground, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 49.9dB   ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 69.2dB, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 76.3dB when A-weighted. The S/N ratios from the 4–8 ohm tap were slightly greater and up to 2dB greater from the 2–4 ohm tap, correlating with the lower gain.With the volume control set to its minimum, the main power supply–related spuriae in the Sigma 170i iQs noise floor were at 60Hz, 120Hz, and 180Hz  , with the highest in level   lying at –72dB ref. 1W from the 8–16 ohm tap into 8 ohms. Peculiarly, with the volume control set to its maximum and the amplifier driving 1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms, sidebands appeared at ±120Hz, ±240Hz, and ±360Hz either side of the peak at 1kHz in this spectrum. I repeated this spectral analysis at lower settings of the volume control and with several different grounding arrangements: floating the amplifiers AC ground; floating the SYS2722s signal generator ground and connecting the analyzers chassis and the VACs chassis with a separate wire; and repeating these conditions with the APx555 system. There was no change in this behavior; it is probably due to a nonzero impedance connection from signal ground to power-supply ground somewhere in the Sigma 170i iQs circuit.Fig.4 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at its maximum   and at its minimum   linear frequency scale).The VAC amplifier is specified as delivering 85Wpc, presumably into 8 ohms  , which is a little higher than I would expect from a push-pull pair of KT88s. Using our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs THD+noise percentage reaches 1%, the amplifier with both channels driven with a 1kHz signal clipped at 11.8Wpc into 8 ohms   from the 8–16 ohm output transformer tap  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N resulted in a power of 51Wpc into 8 ohms  . The shape of the trace in  .5 suggests that the amplifier is \"soft\" clipping, with the usual sharp \"knee\" in the trace where the waveform squares off occurring at THD+N levels above 3%. Less power was available into 4 ohms from the 8–16 ohm tap, 3% THD+N being reached at 10.75W  .Fig.5 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.From the 4–8 ohm tap, the Sigma 170i iQ reached 1% THD+N at 32.6Wpc into 8 ohms   and 79Wpc   at 3% THD+N  . Less power was available into 4 ohms from this tap: 49Wpc at 3% THD+N  . The 2–4 ohm tap was probably optimal for real loudspeaker loads, reaching 3% THD+N at 53Wpc into 8 ohms  , 75Wpc into 4 ohms  , and 74Wpc into 2 ohms  .Fig.7 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 4–8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.8 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 4–8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.9 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 2–4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The distortion levels in  s.5–8 never drop below 0.1%  ; this will be due in part to the presence of the power-supply noise noted earlier. The lowest distortion I found was with the 2–4 ohm tap driving a load of 8 ohms. This can be seen in  .10, which plots the THD+N percentage against frequency at 6.35V, which is equivalent to 5W into 8 ohms, 10W into 4 ohms, and 20W into 2 ohms. The THD+N was lowest in the low treble into 8 ohms   but rose at higher and lower frequencies and into lower impedances. The left channel   had higher distortion into 4 and 2 ohms than the right  .Fig.10 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 2–4 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 6.35V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .The Sigma 170i iQs distortion in the left channel was predominantly the third harmonic  . However, the second harmonic was the highest in the right channel  , though the distortion harmonics in this graph are below the level of the supply-related spuriae. When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 8W into 8 ohms from the 2–4 ohm tap  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB  , though the higher-order intermodulation products were a little higher in level. Repeating this spectral analysis from the 8–16 ohm tap, the 1kHz product rose to –60dB  .Fig.11 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 5W into 8 ohms, 0.35% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 5Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, 8–16 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 8Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Turning to the optional phono input, I got the lowest noise by floating the signal generator ground and connecting the Sigma 170i iQs chassis-grounding terminal to the analyzer ground. I primarily tested the VACs phono input from the preamplifier output.The VACs phono stage inverted absolute polarity at all outputs in moving magnet and moving coil modes. The MM input impedance was 53k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 46.5k ohms at 20kHz. In MC mode, with the input impedance set to 470 ohms, I measured 71 ohms at 20Hz, 430 ohms at 1kHz, and 324 ohms at 20kHz. With the input impedance set to 200 ohms, I measured 70 ohms at 20Hz, 183 ohms at 1kHz, and 168 ohms at 20kHz. With the input impedance set to 100 ohms, I measured 60 ohms at 20Hz, 89 ohms at 1kHz, and the same at 20kHz. With the volume control set to its maximum, MM mode offered 56.9dB of gain at the preamplifier output and 81.8dB at the 8–16 ohm loudspeaker output. In MC mode, the maximum gain was 77dB at the preamplifier output and 101.4dB at the 8–16 ohm loudspeaker output. Taking the 21.6dB gain in the preamplifier section into account, these measurements are consistent with the stated phono-section gains of 37dB   and 57dB  .The Sigma 170i iQs RIAA correction offered very low error  , with a slight   boost in the bass before the sharp rolloff that indicates the presence of a subsonic high-pass filter. The RIAA correction was well-matched between the channels. However, there is a slight peak apparent between 50kHz and 100kHz.  Fig.14 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, phono input, MM mode, response with RIAA correction  With the volume control set to its maximum, the phono inputs noise performance in MM mode was good, with unweighted audioband signal/noise ratios   of 49.9dB, left channel, and 55dB, right. These ratios improved by 20dB when A-weighted. The higher gain in the MC mode reduced the S/N ratios, this time ref. 1kHz at 500µV, by around 5dB.The Sigma 170i iQ phono input offered excellent overload margins at 27dB at 1kHz and 20kHz ref. 1kHz at 5mV in MM mode. In MC mode, the overload margin was 26dB at both frequencies ref. 1kHz at 500ÊV. However, the margins were very much lower at 20Hz, at around 3dB in both MM and MC modes. Low-output phono cartridges will work better with the VACs phono stage. The phono inputs distortion was low, primarily consisting of the second harmonic. At an input level 6dB higher than the nominal MM output level of 5mV, this lay at –60dB  . Intermodulation distortion via the VACs phono input was similarly low  .Fig.15 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, phono input, MM mode, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 10mV input  .Fig.16 VAC Sigma 170i IQ, phono input, MM mode, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100mV peak input  .Especially in terms of its output impedance, the VAC 170i iQ resembles other \"classic\" tube-amp designs such as the   PrimaLuna Prologue Premium. A common argument in favor of such designs is that they dont employ feedback to reduce their output impedance, which can have negative sonic consequences. But there are also sonic consequences to such high output impedances. As illustrated in  s.1 and 2, when used from the 4–8 ohm and 8–16 ohm transformer taps, this amplifier will change sonic character with every loudspeaker it is used with.           ',\n",
       " '  Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression M550 monoblock      . I repeated some of the measurements with the magazines Audio Precision APx500 analyzer. Usefully, the box included a set of tests performed with the APx500.Before I performed the testing,   amplifier by running it at one-eighth its specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes, as recommended by the Consumer Electronics Association. After the preconditioning, the M550s top panel was surprisingly cool, at 96.8°F  . The temperature of the massive heatsinks on the amplifiers sides was 101.8°F   and didnt increase significantly with the amplifier idling.The voltage gain into 8 ohms for the balanced input was 29.7dB, and the input inverted absolute polarity, the opposite of what I had found with earlier DAgostino amplifiers  . The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was very slightly lower than the specified 100k ohms, at 95k ohms, dropping inconsequentially to 50k ohms at 20kHz. The output impedance was higher than the specified 0.1 ohm, at 0.37 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, rising slightly to 0.4 ohm at 20kHz. The response with our standard simulated loudspeaker therefore varied by ±0.26dB  . The amplifier offered a wide small-signal bandwidth, the output into 8 ohms   not reaching –3dB until 140kHz. The Progression M550s reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   accordingly featured very short risetimes with, commendably, no apparent overshoot or ringing.  Fig.1 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Measured with both phases of the balanced input shorted to ground, the M550s wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio was 55.3dB, ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 80.5dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 89dB when the reading was A-weighted. The blue trace in  .3, taken at 1W into 8 ohms, reveals that the primary source of noise is magnetic interference at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics, which I assume stem from the massive toroidal transformer. However, at high powers  , the spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics increase in level.Fig.3 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W   and at 100W   into 8 ohms  .When I examined how the percentage of THD+N varied with output power, with clipping defined as when the THD+noise in the amplifiers output reached 1%, the M550 clipped at 555W into 8 ohms  , which is marginally higher than the specified 550W  . The clipping power into 4 ohms   was 840W  ; though this is 1.17dB lower than the specified 1.1kW, I dont hold the wall voltage constant during these tests, feeling that this is more representative of an amplifiers behavior in a typical system. The wall voltage was 118.7V with the amplifier idling but had dropped to 115.1V with the amplifier clipping into 4 ohms. Note from these two graphs that the distortion percentage at low powers is higher than it is at high powers. This behavior was consistent with both Audio Precision analyzers and is almost identical to what I found with the Dan DAgostino Progression Mono amplifier that JVS reviewed in October 2017.Fig.4 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.As with the earlier amplifier, I examined how the THD+N percentage varied with frequency at a high level, 28.3V, which is equivalent to 100W into 8 ohms, 200W into 4 ohms, and 400W into 2 ohms.   The results are shown in  .6: The distortion and noise remain low over most of the audioband into the higher impedances with only a minuscule rise in the top octave.   However, when  waveform of the THD+N at 100W into 8 ohms after notching out the fundamental  , I saw spikes in the residual waveform   that coincided with the zero-crossing points in the signals waveform  . This behavior indicates the presence of crossover distortion.Fig.6 Dan DAgostino Progression, THD+N   vs frequency at 28.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, 1kHz waveform at 100W into 8 ohms, 0.062% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output while it drove 50Hz at 100W into 8 ohms. The subjectively innocuous second harmonic lies at –74dB  , but a regular series of high-order harmonics can be seen, which correlates with the waveform of the spuriae shown in  .7. The harmonic spectrum was very similar with the amplifier driving 50Hz into 4 ohms and 1kHz into 8 ohms at 28.3V  . At 1W into 8 ohms, the second harmonic was still the highest in level but lay at –60dB   and was still accompanied by higher-order harmonics. Fig.9 shows the spectrum of the M550s output as it drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones into 8 ohms at a peak level of 100W. While the difference product at 1kHz lay at an okay –73dB  , there are also many higher-order intermodulation products visible in this graph.Fig.8 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 100W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Dan DAgostino Progression M550, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 100W peak into 8 ohms  .The Dan DAgostino Master Audio Systems Progression M550 is a powerful amplifier indeed and will not be fazed by being required to drive low-impedance loudspeakers. However, the presence of what appeared to be crossover distortion, which suggests insufficient output-stage bias, is puzzling. Footnote 1: In measuring the Momentum HD preamplifier, I found it inverted polarity, but in a Manufacturers Comment, Dan DAgostino wrote that this was due to an error in the pre-production firmware code that was fixed in all production units.

       " '  First Watt SIT-3,    .  ,   SIT-3 by running it at one-third power into 8 ohms for an hour. At the end of that time the top panel was warm, at 106.3°F  , and the heatsinks were hot, at 123.8°F  .The First Watts voltage gain into 8 ohms was a very low 11.3dB and the amplifier preserved absolute polarity  . The input impedance measured close to the specified 200k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still very high 151k ohms at 20kHz. The output impedance was half that of the First Watt J2, which Herb Reichert reviewed in October 2016, at 0.25 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 0.265 ohm at 20kHz. As a result, the response with our standard simulated loudspeaker varied by ±0.2dB  . This graph shows that the audioband response is flat up to 10kHz, with a rolloff in the top octave reaching –0.8dB at 20kHz. The SIT-3 reproduced a 10kHz squarewave with short risetimes, and no overshoot or ringing  .Fig.1 First Watt SIT-3, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 First Watt SIT-3, small-signal, 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Like the J2, the SIT-3s channel separation was excellent, measuring >100dB in both directions below 1kHz, and still 74dB at 20kHz. The wideband, unweighted signal/noise ratio, ref. 2.83V and measured with the input shorted to ground, was an excellent 87.3dB in the left channel and an even greater 95.4dB in the right. These ratios improved to 94.5 and 98.1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 107dB when A-weighted. These high ratios will be related to the low overall gain, of course. Spectral analysis of the SIT-3s noise floor   revealed spuriae both at 120Hz and its harmonics, and at 60Hz and its odd-order harmonics; the latter will be due to magnetic interference from the AC power transformer. All of these spuriae are very low in level, however, and will not be audible.Fig.3 First Watt SIT-3, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The SIT-3 is specified as being able to deliver 18Wpc into 8 ohms  . With \"clipping\" defined as when the THD+noise reaches 1%,  .4 indicates that the SIT-3 clipped at 8.4Wpc into 8 ohms  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N, the First Watt clipped at the specified 18Wpc. Into 4 ohms  , the SIT-3 delivered 16.8Wpc   at 1% THD+N, and 36Wpc   at 3%. Figs. 4 and 5 both show that while the distortion is low at very low powers, it rises linearly as the power increases. This is typical for an amplifier with a single-ended output stage.Fig.4 First Watt SIT-3, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 First Watt SIT-3, both channels driven, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The First Watt SIT-3 offered levels of distortion that remained relatively constant with frequency but that increased into lower impedances  . Fortunately, and as specified by First Watts Nelson Pass  , the SIT-3s distortion was predominantly the sonically benign second harmonic, what appears to be the opposite phase to the fundamental, at least regarding the positive-going half cycles  .   Though the third harmonic was present at a level around 15dB lower than that of the second  , it didnt increase in level as the power increased or the impedance dropped  . However, higher-order harmonics became visible when the output reached 5W into 8 ohms and above, as predicted by Nelson Pass  . Tested with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a low power into 8 ohms, the levels of higher-order intermodulation products were relatively low  , though the second-order difference product lay at –54dB  . Commendably, the levels of these intermodulation products were similar when I kept the output voltage the same and halved the load impedance  .Fig.6 First Watt SIT-3, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 First Watt SIT-3, 1kHz waveform at 1Wpc into 8 ohms, 0.244% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 First Watt SIT-3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 First Watt SIT-3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 First Watt SIT-3, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 5Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 First Watt SIT-3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 First Watt SIT-3, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 2Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .Although that relatively high level of second-harmonic distortion, which is a deliberate design choice, is controversial, the First Watt SIT-3 is a well-engineered amplifier.

       " '  Vinnie Rossi LIO    . With its modular topology, offering optional phono and digital-input stages, the choice between a switched-resistor volume control and an autotransformer volume control, an optional tubed line stage, a headphone amplifier, and a MOSFET power amplifier, the LIO is actually eight products in one and presents a complex target for measurements. I tested most of the con urations fully, with spot checks elsewhere.To minimize strain on the amplifiers output stage,   performance of the phono and D/A modules at the fixed-level outputs with the power-amplifier outputs disabled. The moving-magnet input offered a gain of 34.9dB, the two moving-coil inputs   a gain of 57.75dB, both lower than the respective specified gains of 40 and 60dB. Both MM and MC inputs preserved absolute polarity.The MM input impedance was close to the specified 47k ohms at low and middle frequencies, though it dropped to 38k ohms at the top of the audioband. The review sample was fitted with the remotely adjustable input impedance for the MC inputs, which can be adjusted from a maximum value of 2k ohms to 26 ohms. I spot-checked the input impedance at 20Hz, 1kHz, and 20kHz with the impedance set to 99 ohms, 499 ohms, and 2k ohms. However, I got anomalous measurements. Regardless of the setting, the input impedance at 20kHz measured close to 60 ohms; at 20Hz, it was between 200 and 260 ohms. While the MC input impedance did increase or decrease with the setting at 1kHz, I measured 817 ohms at a nominal 2k ohms, 543 ohms at a nominal 499 ohms, and 307 ohms at a nominal 99 ohms. The phono stages output impedance was 1300 ohms at 20Hz, and around 42 ohms in the midrange and above.The MM input featured superbly accurate RIAA de-emphasis, with excellent matching between channels, a wide ultrasonic response, and a gentle low-frequency rolloff of –1dB at 25Hz  . However, the MC inputs had a 5dB peak at 18kHz, with a sharp rolloff above that frequency  . Channel separation was excellent, at >85dB over most of the audioband, and the phono inputs were very quiet, offering signal/noise ratios of around 63dB for both MM and MC stages, measured with those inputs shorted to ground and the measurement bandwidth restricted to the audioband.Fig.1 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Phonostage, response with RIAA correction: MM input  , MC input    .Overload margins at low and middle frequencies were good for both MM and MC inputs, at 19dB   and 17dB  , but the high-frequency overload margin was only okay for the MM input  , and poor for the MC input  . Distortion was a little higher than normal, though predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  . But even at the equivalent MM level of 1kHz at 5mV, high-frequency intermodulation was poor, with the difference component at 1kHz resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones lying at just –33dB  .Fig.2 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Phonostage  , spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 5mV input into 100k ohms  .Fig.3 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Phonostage  , HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 50mV input peak into 100k ohms  .Turning to the digital input module,   USB input using my MacBook Pro running on battery power. Apples USB Prober utility identified the module as \"XMOS USB 2.0 Audio Out\" and confirmed that it operated in the optimal isochronous asynchronous mode. The TosLink input accepted 24-bit data with sample rates up to 96kHz, the coaxial input 24 bits up to 192kHz, while the USB input accepted 32-bit integer data with sample rates up to 384kHz.Measured at the Fixed preamp output, data representing a 1kHz tone at 0dBFS gave a level of 2.205V. However, measured with the Resistor Volume Control   module set to its maximum, a 1kHz tone at –12dBFS resulted in a level of 10.82V into 8 ohms from the MOSFET amplifier modules outputs. This is very close to the amplifiers clipping point  , so the RVC and the Autoformer Volume Control   each needs to be set well below its maximum level in order to avoid overloading the amplifier module with digital inputs.Figs. 4 and 5 show the impulse responses, at 44.1kHz, of the Linear Phase and Minimum Phase reconstruction filters, respectively, and reveal that each filter performs exactly as advertised. Performing the test first described by MBLs Jürgen Reis—in which the DAC is fed first 44.1kHz data representing a full-scale 19.1kHz tone, then data representing white noise—both filters behaved identically. Fig.6 shows the result of this test with Filter 1, the Linear Phase filter. The noise signal   reveals that the audioband response extends up to more than 20kHz, with then a sharp rolloff, reaching the stopband noise floor at 24kHz. The ultrasonic sampling image of the 19.1kHz tone at 25kHz is suppressed by 110dB, and all the distortion harmonics lie at or below –93dB  .Fig.4 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, Filter 1, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.5 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, Filter 2, impulse response at 44.1kHz  .Fig.6 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, Filter 1, wideband spectrum of white noise at –4dBFS   and 19.1kHz tone at 0dBFS  , with data sampled at 44.1kHz  .Fig.7 shows the frequency response of the LIOs digital module with sample rates of 44.1, 96, 192, and 384kHz. With all four rates, the response is flat within the audioband, and with the two lower rates it extends almost to half the sample rate before dropping off very sharply. With the two higher rates, the response starts to roll off gently above 50kHz, with the 384kHz ultrasonic response extending slightly higher than that at 192kHz. Again, the two filters behaved identically on this test.Fig.7 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, Filter 1, frequency response at –12dBFS into 100k ohms with data sampled at: 44.1kHz  , 96kHz  , 192kHz    .Fed first 16-bit data, then 24-bit data, each representing a dithered 1kHz tone at exactly –90dBFS, the drop in the noise floor with the increase in bit depth was just over 10dB  , implying resolution of almost 18 bits. This test was performed with TosLink data; I repeated the test with USB data and got identical results, indicating that the USB input does correctly handle hi-rez data. However, I was puzzled by the appearance of very low-level spuriae at 120Hz and its harmonics in this graph, given the hefty ultracapacitor power supply, which is charged with 24V DC by the outboard supply.Fig.8 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 16-bit data  .The LIO correctly handled 16- and 24-bit undithered data  , and offered low levels of harmonic distortion, with the second harmonic dominant at –80dB  . Intermodulation distortion   was also very low. Tested for its rejection of word-clock jitter, the modules USB input performed very well, as expected. There are no jitter-related sidebands present with 16-bit/44.1kHz J-Test data  , though there is an odd rise in the noise floor either side of the primary tone. This was also present with 24-bit J-Test data. However, with 16- and 24-bit TosLink data, sidebands appeared at ±60, ±120, and ±180Hz  . This, too, puzzled me—there should be no AC-line–related components present at all, given the LIOs massively stiff power supply.Fig.9 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, waveform of undithered 1kHz sinewave at –90.31dBFS, 24-bit data  .Fig.10 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, spectrum with noise and spuriae of dithered 1kHz tone at –90dBFS with: 16-bit data  , 24-bit data    .Fig.11 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 0dBFS into 100k ohms  .Fig.12 Vinnie Rossi LIO, digital input, high-resolution jitter spectrum of analog output signal, 11.025kHz at –6dBFS, sampled at 44.1kHz with LSB toggled at 229Hz: 16-bit data from MacBook Pro via USB  .

Center frequency of trace, 11.025kHz; frequency range, ±3.5kHz.The LIOs headphone-amplifier module follows whichever volume-control option has been fitted, and is connected in parallel with the Variable preamp outputs and the input of the MOSFET amplifier module, if fitted. It offered a maximum gain of 13dB with the AVC and inverted signal polarity. The output impedance was a suitably low 6 ohms at low and middle frequencies, though this rose to 18.5 ohms at 20kHz. Though the audioband response was flat and well matched between channels, I was surprised to find a 10dB peak at 35kHz with the AVC feeding the headphone module  .Fig.14 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Headphone output, Autoformer Volume Control set to \"43\" frequency response at 1V into 600 ohms  .With line-level signals, the AVC module preserved absolute polarity  . Set to its maximum level of \"63,\" the AVC had low input impedances of 4.8 and 7.5k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, respectively, and a very low impedance of just 400 ohms at 20kHz. This last will stress many tubed source components, but fortunately, the input impedance increased at lower settings. With the AVC set to \"43,\" for example, the input impedance measured 92k ohms at 1kHz and 58.5k ohms at 10kHz. The Resistor Volume Control  , set to its maximum of \"63,\" offers unity gain and an input impedance of 28k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping slightly to 21.3k ohms at 20kHz.  behavior of the Tubestage using the RVC module at the Variable preamplifier outputs. It offers an insertion loss of just over 0.7dB; ie, fed 1V at 1kHz, it outputs 921mV, and the module preserved absolute polarity. Its output impedance was a low 53 ohms at 20kHz and 1kHz, though this rose to 1450 ohms at 20Hz. The Tubestage was reasonably linear—with a 50Hz tone at 300mV into 100k ohms, the second harmonic was the highest in level and lay at –64dB  .Fig.15 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Tubestage, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to maximum, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 300mV into 100k ohms  .  MOSFET amplifier module in four setups: 1) with the RVC module and the Tubestage; 2) with the RVC and no Tubestage, using the little bypass module in the latters place; 3) with the AVC, which replaces both the RVC and the Tubestage; and 4) without any volume-control module, which appears to send the selected input signal straight to the amplifier module. The maximum voltage gain at the speaker terminals into 8 ohms varied with each of these conditions: 33.4dB with the AVC, and a significantly lower 25.8dB with and without the RVC or Tubestage. Comparisons among these different volume control modules will be misleading unless the different gains are compensated for.The MOSFET amplifier modules input impedance was a reasonably high 40k ohms. Its output impedance was low, at 0.12 ohm at 20Hz, 0.084 ohm at 1kHz, and 0.086 ohm at 20kHz, which gave a very small variation in response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  . Fig.16, taken with the Tubestage driving the amplifier module and the RVC set to \"63,\" shows excellent channel matching and a wide small-signal bandwidth. However, when I repeated this test with the AVC also set to \"63,\" a 13dB peak at 34kHz appeared. The height of this peak didnt appear to be affected by the volume-control setting, though the frequency increased at lower settings. Fig.17, for example, compares the LIOs overall frequency response, measured at the speaker terminals, with both the RVC and AVC set to \"43.\" The RVCs ultrasonic response   is identical to what it was in  .16, with a –3dB point at 75kHz, while with the AVC, the 13dB peak now lies at 80kHz. The puzzle to me is that this ultrasonic peak with the AVC resulted in no overshoot or ringing with the LIOs squarewave response  . I did wonder if there was some sort of interaction between the AVCs transformers and the input of the Audio Precision test set, but then I remembered that this peak was also evident with the AVC feeding the LIOs headphone module.Fig.16 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.17 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to \"43\"  , Autoformer Volume Control set to \"43\"  : frequency response at 2.83V into 8 ohms  .Fig.18 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum: small-signal, 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The amplifier modules channel separation was good, at >90dB between 1 and 3kHz, though it dropped to 64dB at 100Hz and 78dB at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband S/N ratio, measured with the line input shorted and the AVC set to \"63,\" was a good 77.3dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms. This improved to 91.3dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 94.3dB when A-weighted. Again I was puzzled by the appearance of low-level spuriae at 60Hz and its harmonics in the amplifiers output when it drove 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  . The AVC was connected for this measurement, and perhaps the transformers were picking up radiated magnetic interference from the computer that runs the Audio Precision software. However, moving the computer made no difference.Fig.19 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum: spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .The LIO is specified as being able to deliver 25Wpc into 8 ohms   or 45Wpc into 4 ohms  . However, with our standard definition of clipping being when the THD+noise reaches 1%, the LIO didnt reach those powers under that condition. It clipped at 17Wpc into 8 ohms   and 30Wpc into 4 ohms  . The LIO did meet its specified power into both impedances at 11% THD+N, however. Perhaps more significant is the level of THD+N at lower powers, which is fairly high. These graphs were taken with a signal frequency of 1kHz and the RVC driving the amplifier module; changing to the AVC or adding the Tubestage made no difference. But when I plotted how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a voltage level equivalent to 3Wpc into 8 ohms and 6Wpc into 4 ohms, it appears that the Tubestage itself contributes distortion at high frequencies. Fig.22 shows the variation in THD with the AVC,  .23 with the Tubestage. In both cases, the THD level at moderate powers is high. Fortunately for the sound quality, the distortion is heavily second-harmonic in nature  , though plenty of higher-order harmonics are present, especially at low frequencies  . And given Herb Reicherts positive reaction to the LIOs sound when used as an integrated amplifier with the AVC, it is perhaps not surprising that its high-frequency intermodulation performance in this con uration, measured at a level close to visible waveform clipping on the oscilloscope, was not too bad  .Fig.20 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control set to maximum: distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.21 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control set to maximum: distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.22 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum, THD+N  vs frequency at 4.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.23 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to maximum, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.24 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum, 1kHz waveform at 6W into 4 ohms, 0.47% THD+N  : distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.25 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Resistor Volume Control and Tubestage, volume control set to maximum: spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 3W into 8 ohms  .Fig.26 Vinnie Rossi LIO, Autoformer Volume Control set to maximum: HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 3W peak into 8 ohms  .Finally, as the LIO is powered by the capacitor supply, it will run only a certain length of time from one bank of capacitors before switching to the other. With the LIO driving 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms and one capacitor bank newly charged, the supply voltage dropped from 22.9 to 19V in exactly three minutes, at which point the LIO automatically switched to the second bank, now freshly charged, with a just-audible click.I was impressed by the concept underlying the Vinnie Rossi LIO, and its physical execution is stunning. But other than the RVC, moving-magnet Phonostage, and Digital modules, all of which offered good to excellent measured performance, there are problems with the other modules that bothered me. Of course, the benefit of the approach adopted by Vinnie Rossi with the LIO is that he can introduce running improvements to individual modules without requiring the owner replace the entire chassis.

       " '  darTZeel NHB-458, I used Stereophiles loan sample of the top-of-the-line   system  , I ran it at 1/3 its rated power into 8 ohms for 60 minutes, which thermally is the worst case for an amplifier with a class-A/B output stage. At the end of that period, while the shrouded heatsink on the amplifiers rear was too hot to keep my hand on, at 63.5°C/146°F, the top of the enclosure was only warm, at 40.8°C/107.4°F, according to my infrared thermometer. The THD+noise with the amplifier stone cold was 0.08%; after an hour with the amplifier hot, it had risen slightly, to 0.083%—a much smaller change than I have found with some other solid-state amplifiers.I wasnt able to test the NHB-458 through its impedance-matched 50-ohm Zeel input; I measured its performance using the conventional unbalanced and balanced inputs, selecting each with the front-panel Menu buttons.   As used by Michael Fremer, the amplifiers gain was set to \"32dB\"; via the unbalanced input, the voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 32.05dB. The balanced inputs gain was 6dB lower. Both inputs preserved absolute polarity  , the XLR being wired with pin 2 hot.The unbalanced input impedance, specified as being >30k ohms, was a usefully high 46k ohms at low and middle frequencies, dropping inconsequentially to 37k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was 20k ohms at all frequencies, as specified. The output impedance was high for a solid-state design, at 0.3 ohm   at all frequencies. Consequently, there was a slight, ±0.25dB variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker  , due to the Ohms Law interaction between this impedance and that of the load. The NHB-458s small-signal frequency was otherwise flat within the audioband with all impedances above 2 ohms; the bandwidth into 8 ohms was wide, the response being down by <1dB at 200kHz  . As a result, the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms featured very short risetimes  , with no trace of overshoot or ringing. Good stuff!Fig.1 darTZeel NHB-458, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .The darTZeel amplifier was quiet, the unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   measuring 81.4dB with the RCA input jack shorted to ground. Switching an A-weighting filter into circuit increased the ratio to 92.4dB, as the noise predominantly comprised low levels of the 60Hz AC supply frequency  , perhaps partly due to magnetic interference from the massive toroidal transformer that is the amplifiers heart.Fig.2 darTZeel NHB-458, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 darTZeel NHB-458, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Figs. 4, 5, and 6 show how the THD+N percentage changes with output power into 8, 4, and 2 ohms, respectively, taken from the unbalanced input. This is a powerful amplifier. Defining the clipping point as the power when the THD+N reaches 1%, the NHB-458 clips at 530W into 8 ohms  , 900W into 4 ohms  , and 1025W into 2 ohms  .   Usually with a solid-state amplifier, the shapes of the traces in  s. 4, 5, and 6 would indicate that the THD+N reading was dominated by noise at low powers, with the actual distortion rising out of the noise floor at each traces inflection point. But the NHB-458 is a very quiet amplifier, and these traces reveal that the distortion is, very unusually, higher at lower powers than at higher powers, at least until the amplifier starts to clip. I would have suspected crossover distortion due to a lack of output-stage bias current, except that crossover distortion comprises subjectively irritating high-order harmonics—and, as you will see, the NHB-458s distortion spectrum is dominated by low-order harmonics.Fig.4 darTZeel NHB-458, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 darTZeel NHB-458, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 darTZeel NHB-458, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.To ensure that noise didnt affect the measurement, I examined how the darTZeels THD+N percentage changed with frequency at a fairly high voltage, 12.67V  . The results are shown in  .7; while the THD roughly doubles with each halving of the load impedance, it remains constant at all frequencies, which is something I conjecture correlates with good sound quality, provided the spectrum of the distortion consists of low-order harmonics. Which the NHB-458s distortion spectrum does: Fig.8 indicates that it primarily consists of the subjectively innocuous second and third harmonics. This graph was taken at a low power; at high powers, higher-order harmonics can be seen  , though the spectrum doesnt change significantly when a 4 ohm load   is substituted for 8 ohms  , other than an increase in the third harmonic. Despite the higher-than-usual harmonic distortion, the NHB-458 did relatively well on the high-power, high-frequency intermodulation test  . While the difference component at 1kHz lies at –64dB  , all the higher-order intermodulation products lie below that level.Fig.7 darTZeel NHB-458, THD+N   vs frequency at 12.67V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.8 darTZeel NHB-458, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 4 ohms  , 0.187% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 darTZeel NHB-458, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at: 150W into 8 ohms  , 300W into 4 ohms    .Fig.10 darTZeel NHB-458, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 200W peak into 4 ohms  .Its measured performance reveals that darTZeels NHB-458 offers extremely wide dynamic range capability. While its distortion is not as low as is usually found in modern solid-state designs, perhaps of greater importance is the fact that that distortion comprises low-order harmonics, and that the distortion doesnt change its harmonic character with frequency           ',\n",
       " 'I used my   system   to measure the Octave V 40 SE. After installing the four KT88 output tubes per the setup sheet, and before doing any measurements, I let the amplifier warm up for a morning. I then checked the bias voltage for the KT88s using the front-panel rotary switch and the LED display. All four LEDs illuminated green, which, according to the excellent owners manual, means \"Setting is OK.\" I took a complete set of measurements with the amplifier used alone, then repeated most of the testing with the auxiliary Black Box capacitor bank connected.The maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same with or without the Black Box outboard capacitance bank, at 38.75dB, and the V 40 SE preserved absolute polarity; ie, was non-inverting. The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was, at 61.5k ohms, usefully higher than the specified 50k ohms, and was still 51k ohms at the top of the audioband. The output impedance is specified as 2 ohms; however, the measured impedance was significantly higher than this, at 3.3 ohms at 20Hz, 4.3 ohms at 1kHz, and 3.8 ohms at 20kHz. I was surprised that these measured impedances were not lowered by the Black Box.With these high output-impedance values, the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker, resulting from the Ohms law interaction between the amplifiers output impedance and the manner in which the load impedance varies with frequency, reached ±2.1dB  . The two channels matched very closely in the audioband into 8 ohms  , though the left channel rolled off a little earlier above 20kHz. The ultrasonic rolloff is very fast, and there is a sign of a slight peak developing between 30 and 50kHz in the right channel into lower impedances  . This correlates with some critically damped overshoot—one half-cycle of overshoot and no ringing—with a 10kHz squarewave  .Fig.1 Octave V 40 SE, frequency response with volume control at its maximum at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Octave V 40 SE, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was modest, at >65dB below 1kHz, and just 38dB in both directions at 20kHz.   I measure an integrated amplifiers signal/noise ratio in the worst-possible case, with its input shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum. The wideband, unweighted ratio under these conditions, ref. 2.83V or 1W into 8 ohms and with the Black Box connected, was 77.6dB in the left channel and 78.5dB in the right. The ratios improved to 79.9 and 84.3dB, respectively, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 84.2 and 87dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the V 40 SEs output while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms   revealed that the left channels slightly poorer noise performance was due to a higher level of 60Hz in that channel, though at –83dB  , this wont be audible.Fig.3 Octave V 40 SE, spectrum of 1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms, DC–1kHz  .The V 40 SEs maximum output power is specified at 40Wpc into 4 ohms  . Figs. 4 and 5 plot the THD+noise percentage in the amplifiers output against output power into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. We define clipping as when the THD+N reaches 1%, and these two graphs indicate that, into both impedances, the Octave clips at 26.5W  . Adding the Black Box didnt increase the power at clipping. However, the V 40 SE reaches its specified power into 4 ohms at 1.12% THD+N, and the THD+N is still just 1.18% at 50Wpc into 4 ohms  , which is when the amplifier starts to hard clip  . Below 50W, the THD+N rises linearly with increasing power, this due to the low level of loop negative feedback used.Fig.4 Octave V 40 SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Octave V 40 SE, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The distortion below 1W is low, especially into higher impedances. Fig.6 plots the percentage of THD+N against frequency at 2.83V into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The distortion rises at the frequency extremes, as expected from the circuit topology, but only into 2 ohms   does it become problematically high. Fortunately, the distortion content at low powers is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic, even into low impedances  , though it is joined at higher powers by some high-order harmonics  . High-frequency intermodulation distortion   was what Id expected from the Octaves THD-vs-frequency behavior, with the 1kHz difference component—resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10Wpc into 8 ohms—reaching –50dB  . There is a peculiar rise in the power-supply–rated spuriae in the mid-treble in this graph, which was taken with the Black Box connected. Disconnecting the Black Box didnt change this behavior, nor did experimenting with all the various ways of grounding the amplifier to the Audio Precision test system.Fig.6 Octave V 40 SE, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.7 Octave V 40 SE, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 4 ohms  , 0.208% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Octave V 40 SE, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Octave V 40 SE, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms  .Other than that anomaly, Octaves V 40 SE measured as I would expect from a traditional design that uses a pair of KT88 output tubes for each channel. And, like Octaves RE 290, a 100Wpc power amplifier favorably reviewed by Erick Lichte in our January 2013 issue, the V 40 SE is constructed to an impressively high standard.           ',\n",
       " '  Pathos InPoL Remix MkII with my  , checking some of the results with the magazines APx500 system.The review sample was not fitted with the optional HiDac Mk2 digital-input board. Although the Remix MkIIs output stages are described as operating in class-A, where the maximum heat dissipation is with no signal, I still preconditioned the Pathos amplifier before the testing by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the heatsinks were hot, at 118.1°F  , as was the top panel, at 113.6°F  . This amplifier needs to be well-ventilated.The Pathoss volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps, and the maximum voltage gain from the loudspeaker outputs into 8 ohms was 36.2dB for both the balanced and unbalanced inputs. The maximum gain at the balanced Pre outputs was 17dB; at the single-ended Pre outputs it was 10.1dB; and from the headphone output it was 8dB. The Remix MkII preserved absolute polarity   at all the outputs with both input types. The input impedance is specified as 47k ohms.I measured a usefully higher 92k ohms for the unbalanced input at low and middle frequencies, dropping to a still-high 50.5k ohms at the top of the audioband. The balanced input impedance was 176k ohms at 20Hz, 180k ohms at 1kHz, and 137k ohms at 20kHz. The Pathos wont load down source components,The Pathoss line-level source impedances were 929 ohms from the balanced Pre output, 465 ohms from the unbalanced Pre output, and a usefully low 1 ohm from the headphone output, these values consistent across the audioband. The loudspeaker output impedance was a relatively high 0.8 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 0.84 ohm at 20kHz.   The modlation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance  of our standard simulated loudspeaker, was therefore ±0.7dB  , which may well be audible. The response into resistive loads was flat in the audioband but rolled off above 20kHz. The response into 8 ohms   was down by 1dB at 80kHz, that into 2 ohms   was –1dB at 55kHz.Fig.1 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Note the 0.25dB channel imbalance in favor of the right channel in this graph, which was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the imbalance was identical when I repeated the response measurement with the control set to –20dB. The frequency response at the headphone output was down by just 1dB at 200kHz. As expected from the Remix MkIIs wide small-signal bandwidth, its reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave from the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms   was superb, with no overshoot or ringing.Fig.2 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was very good, at >95dB below 2kHz and still 73dB at the top of the audioband. Measured with the unbalanced input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/ noise ratio was a disappointing 52.2dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms  , improving to 71.9dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz– 22kHz. Switching an A-weighting filter into circuit further improved the ratio to 75.6dB. Spectral analysis of the Remix MkIIs low-frequency noisefloor with the volume control set to its maximum   revealed a relatively high level of random noise, with low-level spuriae visible at the 60Hz power-supply frequency and its odd-order harmonics. Repeating the analysis with the volume control set to –20dB   reduced the levels of both the random noise and the 60Hz-related spuriae by the same 20dB. This suggests that the noise occurs in the circuit ahead of the volume control, perhaps in the input tubes.Fig.3 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at maximum   and at –20dB    .The Pathos InPoL Remix MkII is specified to deliver up to 25Wpc into 8 ohms   and 38Wpc into 4 ohms  , the former at 0.1% THD. With our definition of clipping, which is when the outputs percentage of THD+noise reaches 1%, and with both channels driven, the Remix MkII clipped with a 1kHz signal at 20W into 8 ohms   and at 8W into 4 ohms  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N gave powers of 30W into 8 ohms   and 12W into 4 ohms  . The amplifier met its specified maximum power into 4 ohms at 6.5% THD+N.Fig.4 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The shape of the traces in  s.4 and 5 suggests that the actual distortion starts to rise above the noisefloor at a few hundred milliwatts and increases steadily as the power rises. This implies that little or no loop negative feedback is present. I examined how the percentage of THD+noise changed with frequency at 5.3V, which is equivalent to 3.5W into 8 ohms and 7W into 4 ohms. The THD+N was close to 0.1% into 8 ohms  , but was 10 times higher into 4 ohms  . The THD+N percentage was a little higher in the right channel into both loads.Fig.6 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, THD+N   vs frequency at 5.3V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The left channels distortion with 1kHz into 8 ohms was predominantly the third harmonic  , but in the right channel   it was joined by the second harmonic at the same level, –73dB or 0.02%. At the same voltage, 2.83V, into 4 ohms  , the third harmonic rose to –54dB   in both channels. Intermodulation distortion with the amplifier driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1W into 8 ohms   was low in level. Both the second-order difference product at 1kHz and the higher-order intermodulation products lay at –80dB  . A peculiar rise in the high-frequency noisefloor can be seen in the right channels spectrum  .Fig.7 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.257% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.8 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.9 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 2Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.10 Pathos InPol Remix MkII, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .The Pathos InPoL Remix MkIIs measured performance appears to be dominated by its use of a tubed input stage with little or no loop negative feedback.   But the amplifiers inability to drive low impedances without what I feel to be excessive levels of harmonic distortion is a matter for concern.

       " 'When I unpacked the Riviera Levante amplifier and lifted it onto the test bench, it struck me that this is actually eight amplifiers in one. It has balanced and single-ended line-level inputs. Its output stage can be operated in class-A or class-AB. It was supplied with two choices for the two input stage ECC81/12AT7 tubes: vintage Mullards or modern JJs. Add to those variations that the Levante has a headphone output and an optional phono stage  , and it became clear that I had a lot of testing ahead of me.I decided to focus on the Riviera amplifiers behavior with the Mullard tubes and the unbalanced inputs, performing every test in both of the output-stage modes. I then repeated some of the tests with the balanced inputs and finally looked at how the amplifiers behavior with the JJ tubes differed from how it had performed with the Mullard tubes. All the testing was performed  .I first preconditioned the Riviera Levante by following the CEAs recommendation of operating it at one-eighth the specified class-AB power into 8 ohms for 30 minutes. At the end of that time, the heatsink temperature was 108.3°F   and that of the top and front panels was 92.5°F  . Switching to class-A operation, the heatsink temperature had increased slightly after another 30 minutes, to 113.1°F  . While I was preconditioning the amplifier,   output device rail voltages. They were ±29V in class-A, ±50V in class-AB.The amplifier inverted absolute polarity with all its inputs at both the loudspeaker and headphone outputs. The maximum gain into 8 ohms was lower than average for an integrated amplifier, at 36.6dB in class-A and 36.35dB in class-AB for both balanced and unbalanced inputs. The maximum gain at the headphone output was 21.6dB for both types of input. Changing to the JJ tubes reduced these gains by 1dB.The unbalanced input impedance was 44k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz with the Mullard tubes, dropping to 36k ohms at 20kHz. The balanced input impedance was 42k ohms across the audioband. With the JJ tubes the unbalanced input impedance was 34k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 30k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone output impedance was moderately low, at 18 ohms across the audioband. Set to class-A operation, the Levantes output impedance at the loudspeaker terminals was 0.5 ohm from 20Hz to 20kHz. In class-AB, the output impedance was slightly higher, at 0.65 ohm at all audio frequencies.   In class-A mode, the modulation of the amplifiers frequency response, due to the Ohms law interaction between the source impedance and the impedance of my standard simulated loudspeaker, was ±0.4dB  . The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was down by 3dB at 180kHz, which correlates with the Rivieras accurate reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into that load  . Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the unbalanced inputs, the Mullard tubes, class-A mode, and the volume control set to its maximum. The frequency and squarewave responses were identical with the JJ tubes, in class-AB, and with the balanced inputs. With the volume control set to –20dB, the high-frequency –3dB point dropped to 110kHz, but the audioband response remained flat. Measured at the headphone output, the response was down by just 1dB at 200kHz.Fig.1 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, volume control set to maximum, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms   4 ohms  ,    .Fig.2 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation was okay at 70dB in both directions below 3kHz, dropping to 53dB at the top of the audioband. The Rivieras unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, taken with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum, was 70.6dB ref. 2.83V into 8 ohms   in both class-A and class-AB modes. This ratio improved to 72dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 80dB when A-weighted. The background noise included spuriae at 60Hz and its even- and odd-order harmonics  , the latter higher in level than the former, particularly in the left channel  .  Fig.3 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms, volume control set to maximum  .With both channels driven, the Levantes maximum power in class-A is specified as 30Wpc into 8 ohms and 60Wpc into 4 ohms  . We define clipping as when the THD+noise in an amplifiers output reaches 1%. By that standard, the Levante didnt meet its specified powers, the 1% THD+N power measuring 16Wpc into 8 ohms   and 21.3Wpc into 4 ohms  . However, relaxing the criterion to 3% THD+N, the Riviera amplifier clipped at 49Wpc into 8 ohms   and 79Wpc into 4 ohms  . The picture was similar in class-AB. The Levante delivered 12Wpc into 8 ohms   at 1% THD+N, 125Wpc at 3%  , and 18Wpc into 4 ohms   at 1% and 195Wpc into 4 ohms at 3%  . The AC mains voltage was 119.1V with the amplifier clipping in class-A into 4 ohms.Fig.4 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.6 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-AB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-AB, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The upward slope of the traces below the actual clipping power in  s.4–7 indicates that the distortion increases in almost a linear manner with increasing power before the onset of actual waveform clipping. This will be due to what is called a \"bent\" transfer function.   I suspect that this bent function will be due to the input tube rather than the amplifiers output stage. I examined how the THD+N percentage changed with frequency at 4.89V, which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms, 6W into 4 ohms, and 12W into 2 ohms. With the Mullard tubes the distortion into 8 ohms   was 0.47% at low and middle frequencies, rising slightly in the treble. It also rose into 4 ohms   and into 2 ohms  . The distortion was slightly lower with the JJ tubes  , but the behavior was otherwise identical.Fig.8 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.89V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.9 Riviera Levante, JJ tubes, class-A, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.89V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .These levels of distortion would be very audible if they comprised the fifth and higher harmonics  . However,  .10 indicates that the relatively subjectively benign second harmonic was dominant in both class-A and class-AB output modes. This waveform graph was taken with the Mullard tubes. Though HR found the JJ tubes to sound different from the Mullards, the JJs produced an almost identical THD+N waveform  . This was confirmed by the spectra of the amplifiers output at moderate power into 8 ohms with the Mullard tubes   and JJ tubes  . The second harmonic is by far the highest in level, at –40dB   with the Mullards and –43dB   with the JJs. The second was also by far the highest-level harmonic present in the headphone output, at –47dB   at 1V into 300 ohms. Finally, when the Levante drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10W peak into 8 ohms in either class-A or class-AB with both Mullard and JJ tubes, the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at –44dB  , with the higher-order intermodulation products at 18kHz and 21kHz 10dB lower in level. At the same voltage into 4 ohms, the intermodulation products rose by 3dB.Fig.10 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.95% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Riviera Levante, JJ tubes, class-A, 1kHz waveform at 10W into 8 ohms, 0.75% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.13 Riviera Levante, JJ tubes, class-A, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.14 Riviera Levante, JJ tubes, headphone output, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms  .Fig.15 Riviera Levante, Mullard tubes, class-A, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms  .With its output stage capable of being switched between class-A and class-AB operation, Rivieras Levante reminded me of the Marantz MA-5 amplifier that I reviewed for Hi-Fi News magazine in August 1983, which, like the Levante, could output 30W in class-A and 120W in class-AB. But unlike that Marantz, which featured conventional levels of negative feedback, the Levantes measured behavior is dominated by the designers decision not to use feedback, especially around the input tubes. His reasons for doing so are discussed in the review, but my experience has been that the resultant harmonic signature will lend this amplifier a distinctive sonic character. Footnote 1: I created tracks on Stereophiles Test CD 2 to allow listeners to hear at what percentage of second, third, and seventh harmonic they become aware of the distortion.          ',\n",
       " '  LSA VT-70  . Although potentiometers on the top panel allow the bias currents for the output tubes to be adjusted, I understand that these currents are set by the manufacturer before the amplifier leaves the factory. Nevertheless, before I started the testing, I checked the tube bias with the front-panel meters after a 30-minute warm-up; with no signal and the volume control set to its minimum, the bias was very close to an indicated \"100\" for each tube.The LSA VT-70 preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, from both of its output transformer taps, from the headphone output, and from the preamplifier output. The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz from the loudspeaker outputs into 8 ohms was 37.4dB from the 8 ohm tap, 36.17dB from the 4 ohm output tap. The maximum gain from the headphone output was 41.4dB and from the preamplifier output, it was –0.23dB, ie, slightly lower than the input level. The single-ended input impedance is specified as a high 100k ohms. I measured a still-high 42k ohms at 20Hz, 44k ohms at 1kHz, and 39k ohms at 20kHz.The preamplifier output impedance was a low 2 ohms at high and middle frequencies, though it rose to 265 ohms in the low bass, presumably due to the presence of a series coupling capacitor. The headphone outputs source impedance was a high 470 ohms across the audioband, which means this output will not be optimal for use with low-impedance headphones.Although the VT-70s loudspeaker output impedance is specified as 8 ohms or 4 ohms, I suspect that these actually refer to the nominal values of the output transformer taps. The source impedance of the 8 ohm tap was a very high 5.1 ohms at low and midrange frequencies, rising to 7.4 ohms at the top of the audioband. As expected, the impedance was lower from the 4 ohm tap, at 2.7 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 3.8 ohms at 20kHz. The variation in the LSA-70 amplifiers small-signal frequency response from the 8 ohm tap with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was an audible ±2.4dB. From the 4 ohm tap  , the variation was smaller, at ±1.75dB, but this will still be audible. Into resistive loads  , the VTA-70 started to gently roll off in the top octave, with then a sharp dropoff above 45kHz.Fig.1 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.1, taken with the volume control set to its maximum, features excellent channel matching. The channel gains were less well-matched at lower settings of the volume control, with the right channel almost 1dB higher in level than the left when the control was set to –10dB. This difference decreased to 0.3dB with the control set to –20dB.The VT-70s reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   was superbly square, which correlates with the extended low frequencies seen in  .1. However, the ultrasonic rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  , and the small peak just above 40kHz in the frequency response is associated with some ringing on the tops and bottoms of the waveform.Fig.2 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The VT-70s channel separation   was >60dB in both directions below 2kHz but decreased to 40dB R–L and 46dB L–R at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   was a good 76.7dB  . This ratio improved slightly, to 77.8dB, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 90.1dB when A-weighted. The S/N ratios at the 4 ohm taps were around 1.5dB greater. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the LSAs 8 ohm tap drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms   revealed a low level of random noise, and the AC-related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics lay at or below –80dB. This graph was taken with the volume control set to its maximum. Peculiarly, with the control set to –20dB, the odd-order AC-related spuriae were all higher in level.Fig.4 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum   and to –20dB    .LSA specifies the VT-70s maximum power as 35Wpc into 8 ohms  , which is what I would expect from a push-pull pair of EL34 tubes operated in Ultralinear mode.   With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—and with both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of just 7Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms   and the same from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . Relaxing the clipping definition to 3% THD+N gave output powers of 25.3Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms   and 28.45Wpc from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifier uses a limited amount of loop negative feedback. With the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  , 1% THD+N was reached at 19.5Wpc   and 3% THD+N at 27Wpc  . More significantly, the THD+N was lower at low powers than it had been with the load matched to the nominal transformer tap.Fig.5 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.8 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency from the 4 ohm tap into 8 and 4 ohms at 4.9V, which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms and 6W into 4 ohms. The THD+N was higher in the right channel   than the left   and as, shown in  .7, was lower with the higher load impedance. The THD rose at low frequencies due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformer. The THD+N percentage at the same voltage from the 8 ohm tap   was about 5 times as high as it was from the 4 ohm tap.Fig.8 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion waveform from either tap   suggests that the second harmonic was dominant. However, at low frequencies, the third harmonic was the highest in level  , which again will be due to the output transformer. Note that the right channels second harmonic in this graph is almost 20dB higher than in the left channel. This might have been due to the output tubes bias currents not being sufficiently closely matched in that channel, except that these appeared identical when I checked the bias before testing. It is more likely, therefore, that one of the right channels output tubes had aged out of spec.   However, at the same output voltage at higher frequencies  , the second and third harmonics are equally high in level in both channels, each close to –60dB  .Fig.9 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 3W into 8 ohms, 0.18% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.11 LSA VT-70, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms  .Despite the relatively high level of harmonic distortion, intermodulation distortion was only moderate in level. With the VT-70s 8 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay at –66dB  . The higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz were only 4dB higher in level.Fig.12 LSA VT-70, 8 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .The LSA VT-70s measured performance is typical of a conventional tubed design using a push-pull pair of EL34s for its output stage and with only a small amount of loop negative feedback. The lowest distortion will be obtained from the 4 ohm output transformer tap, especially driving impedances >4 ohms, with no significant reduction in maximum power.           ',\n",
       " 'The Line Magnetic LM-845IA looks identical to the companys LM-518IA integrated amplifier that Herb Reichert reviewed in October 2015. However, there are many differences in the details. The amplifier still uses a single 845 directly heated triode for each channels output stage.   I followed the instructions in the manual for setting the bias current for these tubes at the recommended 70mA. After the amplifier had been operating for 30 minutes, I shorted the inputs to ground and adjusted the hum-balancer controls to minimize the noise in each channels output.    amplifier with my    . The output transformer taps are marked \"16,\" \"8,\" and \"4.\" I performed a complete series of tests from each of the three taps using one of the single-ended line-level inputs, then repeated some of the tests using the single-ended \"Pre-In\" input, which is connected directly to the LM-845s power amplifier stage.The LM-845IAs unbalanced input impedance was a high 70k ohms at 20Hz, dropping slightly to 67.5k ohms at 1kHz and to a still-high 44k ohms at 20kHz. The \"Pre-In\" input impedance was 55k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 43k ohms at 20kHz. The Line Magnetic amplifier preserved absolute polarity with both sets of inputs from all three transformer taps. The amplifiers maximum voltage gain at 1kHz into 8 ohms depended on the output tap. The highest gain was from the 16 ohm tap, at 40.3dB. The gain from the 8 ohm tap was 38.6dB, and from the 4 ohm tap it was 36.3dB. The gains using the \"Pre-In\" input were all 15dB lower.The amplifiers output impedance also depended on the output tap. From the 16 ohm tap, the impedance was a high 3.9 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, dropping very slightly to 3.65 ohms at 20kHz. This results in very audible ±2dB variations in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker load  . The variations in response were reduced to ±1.1dB with the 8 ohm tap, which had an output impedance of 2.1 ohms at 20Hz and 1.95 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz. As expected, the lowest output impedance was from the 4 ohm tap: 1.2 ohms at 20Hz and 1.1 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz. While these impedances are relatively low for a single-ended–triode amplifier, the response modification from this tap with the simulated loudspeaker was a still-audible ±0.8dB  .Fig.1 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 16 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Into resistive loads, the small-signal response from all three transformer taps was flat to 20kHz and rolled off above that frequency  . The ultrasonic rolloff is disturbed by a residual resonance at 70kHz, this highest in level from the 4 ohm tap. This behavior is associated with a small amount of overshoot and ringing with the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  . At low frequencies, the amplifier started to roll off below 30Hz, but its reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave   had only slightly sloped-down tops and bottoms, a tribute to the Line Magnetics massive output transformers.Fig.2 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 4 ohm tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.3 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.4 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Figs.1 and 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum. The channel matching was within 0.25dB but increased to 0.4dB in favor of the left channel at lower settings of the volume control. Channel separation at 1kHz was okay, at 61dB, L–R, and 64.7dB, R–L, but reduced to 45.2dB and 52.1dB, respectively, at the top of the audioband.Measured at the 16 ohm taps and taken with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control at its maximum, the amplifiers unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio was 70.6dB   ref. 1W into 8 ohms. This ratio improved to 72.2dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 81.9dB when A-weighted. The S/N ratios from the 8 ohm tap were 2dB greater and another 2dB greater from the 4 ohm tap, these improvements correlating with the lower gain from these taps.   The main power supply–related spuriae in the LM-845IAs noise floor were at 120Hz and 240Hz, the latter higher in the left channel than the right  . The highest in level, at 120Hz, lay at a respectably low –76dB, right channel, and –80dB, left channel, both ref. 1W in both channels. The 120Hz sidebands around the 1kHz tone were a little higher in level in the right channel.Fig.5 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 4 ohm tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms with volume control at its maximum  .The Line Magnetic amplifier is specified as delivering 22Wpc, though no load impedance is mentioned.   Using our usual definition of clipping, which is when the outputs THD+noise percentage reaches 1%, with both channels driven with a 1kHz signal the LM-845IAs 16 ohm tap clipped at just 2Wpc into 16 ohms  . Relaxing the definition of clipping to 3% THD+N resulted in a power of 18Wpc into 16 ohms  , and the amplifier output the specified 22W from this tap at 3.5% THD+N. Distortion at low powers was lower with the 16 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  , and the amplifier now reached 1% THD+N at 10Wpc  , though the power at 3% THD+N had dropped to 16Wpc  .Fig.6 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 16 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 16 ohms.Fig.7 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 16 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.The same trend was apparent with the 8 ohm tap, where the lowest distortion at low powers was obtained with this tap driving 4 ohms  . I usually expect tube amplifiers to give lower distortion when driving impedances greater than the nominal tap value. However, the LM-845IA had greater distortion at low powers in this situation. This can be seen in  .9, which plots the THD+N percentage against power with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms. The distortion is above 1% at all powers above 800mW!Fig.8 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.9 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 4 ohm tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.The shape of the traces in  s.6–9 suggests that the amplifier is \"soft\" clipping, with the usual sharp \"knee\" in the trace where the waveform visibly squares off occurring at THD+N levels above 10%.The distortion levels in  s.6–9 were taken with the left channel and never drop below 0.1%  . However, the distortion was a little lower in the right channel than the left. Fig.10 plots the THD+N percentage against frequency from the 8 ohm tap at 2.83V into 8 ohms   and 4 ohms  , which is equivalent to 1W and 2W, respectively. Except in the bass, the left channel   had higher distortion into both impedances than the right  . The distortion into all loads from all three transformer taps rose in the top audio octaves.Fig.10 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The LM-845IAs distortion in the midrange was predominantly the sonically benign second harmonic  , though the more troubling third harmonic was only slightly lower in level at low frequencies  . When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at a peak level of 1W into 4 ohms from the 8 ohm tap  , the second-order difference product at 1kHz lay at –66dB   in the left channel   but was 14dB higher in the right channel  . The higher-order intermodulation products were all below 0.1%  . Repeating this spectral analysis from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms, the 1kHz product in the right channel rose to –50dB  .Fig.11 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 4 ohm tap, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.4% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.12 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.13 Line Magnetic LM-845IA, 8 ohm tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .The Line Magnetic LM-845IAs performance on the test bench was much as I expect from a tube amplifier with a single-ended output stage. It must be used with high-sensitivity speakers, like AHs Altec Valencias, if distortion is not to become audible. Counterintuitively, the Line Magnetics 16 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps work best with speakers that have impedances lower than the nominal tap value. However, these two taps have sufficiently high output impedances that the amplifiers sonic character will be different with every loudspeaker with which it is used. The 4 ohm tap has a lower output impedance, but this is at the expense of higher distortion, even at low powers, than the higher-impedance taps.           ',\n",
       " '  Mastersound Compact 845 amplifier  . The tubes were installed when I received the review sample, and I waited for an hour after powering up the amplifier before starting the testing. The Mastersound runs hot—after an hour the temperature of the top panel in front of the line-stage tubes was 115.9°F/46.6°C.The Compact 845 inverted polarity from both the 4 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps with the balanced and single-ended inputs but preserved absolute polarity from its Direct inputs, which bypass the preamplifier stage and volume control. The voltage gain at 1kHz from the unbalanced Direct inputs was 23.1dB from the 8 ohm tap and 20.7dB from the 4 ohm tap, both  ures into 8 ohms. From the regular inputs, the gain into 8 ohms from the 8 ohm tap with the volume control set to its maximum was 32dB, balanced, and 36.55dB, unbalanced. The maximum gains from the 4 ohm tap were both 2.3dB lower.The input impedance is specified as a high 50k ohms. For the single-ended Direct input, I measured 33k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, and 28.6k ohms at 20kHz. The normal unbalanced inputs impedance varied from a high 71k ohms at 20Hz to 52.6k ohms at 20kHz; the balanced input impedance was much lower, at 3230 ohms across the audioband.Fig.1 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The source impedance from the 8 ohm output tap was a high 3.5 ohms at 20Hz, 2.6 ohms at 1kHz, and 7.3 ohms at 20kHz. The variation in the small-signal frequency response with this output with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was therefore moderately high, at ±1.7dB. The 4 ohm taps source impedance was lower, at 1.7 ohms at 20Hz, 1.3 ohms at 1kHz, and 3.15 ohms at 20kHz, which meant that the response variation with the simulated speaker was lower, at ±1dB. However, there will be audible modifictions of loudspeaker responses with both output taps. Into resistive loads  , the Mastersound amplifiers 8 ohm output shelved down below 40Hz and rolled off above 10kHz, reaching –3dB at 18kHz. A sharply defined response peak at 30kHz correlates with overshoot and ringing in the amplifiers reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  . This peak was higher in amplitude with higher load impedances and from the 4 ohm output transformer tap.Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the left channel is 0.26dB higher in level at 1kHz than the right. This difference increased to 0.46dB when I repeated the measurement with the volume control set to –20dB, though the response was otherwise identical.                Download audio            Something I noticed while doing these tests was that the Compact 845 emitted audible sounds  , which seemed to be coming from the output tube circuitry rather than the transformers. While the level wasnt very high—the spl in front of the amplifier was 66dB , slow ballistics, with the amplifier driving 1kHz at 1Wpc into 8 ohms—it was still readily audible and was not masked by the NPR news playing on a nearby portable radio in the test lab.The Compact 845s channel separation   was relatively poor, at 50dB in both directions below 1kHz, decreasing to 30dB at the top of the audioband. I monitored the waveform on an oscilloscope when I performed this measurement, which indicated that I was measuring true crosstalk rather than noise. The Mastersound amplifiers output had a relatively low level of noise. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio  , taken from the 8 ohm taps with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was 67.6dB  . This ratio improved slightly to 68.5dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 78.9dB when A-weighted. With their lower gain, the ratios from the 4 ohm outputs were 2dB greater.Fig.3 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum   and to –20dB    .Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Mastersounds 8 ohm taps drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum   revealed a low level of random noise. However, AC supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics were present, and their levels didnt change when I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer. The highest of these spuriae, at 120Hz, lay at –73dB  . Repeating the analysis with the volume control set to –20dB   lowered the levels of the power supply–related spuriae by up to 6dB, but the random noisefloors level didnt change.Fig.4 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Mastersound 845 Compact, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Mastersound specifies the Compact 845s maximum power as 30W, which is equivalent to 14.76dBW into 8 ohms and 11.76dBW into 4 ohms. According to Stereophiles usual definition of clipping, when THD+N reaches 1%, the amplifier didnt get close to that power. With both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of 11.5Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms   and 6.9Wpc from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . Raising the clipping limit to 3% THD+N, I measured 22Wpc with each output tap matched to the load. At 10% THD+N, the Compact 845 approaches its specified power.Fig.6 Mastersound 845 Compact, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Tube amplifiers usually have less distortion when the load impedance is greater than the nominal output transformer impedance. As revealed in  .6, which plots the THD+N percentage against output power with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms, the Mastersounds THD+N was higher with a larger load impedance, not lower. At 3% THD+N, the 4 ohm tap was putting out 10Wpc into 8 ohms.Fig.7 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 4.9V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.7 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency, with the 8 ohm tap driving 8 and 4 ohms at 4.9V, which is equivalent to 3W into 8 ohms and 6W into 4 ohms. The huge rise in distortion above 10kHz may well be due to the high-frequency rolloff in this region and, perhaps, to the fact that the distortion is being magnified by the output transformer resonance seen in  .1. The THD+N rose slightly at low frequencies and was higher into 4 ohms   than it was into 8 ohms  . At the same voltage from the 4 ohm tap  , the distortion in the midrange and treble was close to 0.6% into 4 ohms and 1% into 8 ohms.Fig.8 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.29% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.9 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 3Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fig.10 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 3Wpc into 8 ohms  .Fortunately, as  .8 shows, the distortion was predominantly the   second harmonic, with higher-order harmonics progressively lower in level  . However, at low frequencies  , the level of the third harmonic was the same as the second, perhaps indicating the onset of core saturation in the output transformers.Fig.11 Mastersound 845 Compact, 8 ohm output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 3Wpc peak into 8 ohms  .Due to the masking, the level of the second harmonic may not result in audible distortion with music, as long as it is not accompanied by intermodulation distortion. With the Compact 845s 8 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 3Wpc peak into 8 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay at –30dB  , and many higher-order intermodulation products were present. This behavior correlates with the increase in THD+N in the top audio octave seen in  .7. The amplifier may well sound better than this test suggests, since top-octave energy level is typically lower in music than in test tones. However, this information is presented here, as it is with every review, since we standardized on this intermodulation test when we started measuring amplifiers three decades ago.Other than the differences caused by different output tubes—the 845 tube is capable of putting out more power than the 300B—these results are very similar to those measured in the Mastersound 300 B S.E. integrated amplifier, which Art Dudley reviewed in March 2008. The high levels of distortion and the high source impedances will be due to the single-ended triode topology and the decision not to use loop negative feedback. I concluded my discussion of the 300 B S.E. measurements by asking whether the reviewer liked the amplifier because of what it did right despite what it did wrong, or because of what it did wrong. In 2008, I didnt have an answer to that question. I still dont.           ',\n",
       " '  Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE    . The VK56-SE looks identical to the VK-55SE, which Wes Phillips reviewed in April 2010, and it was instructive to compare its measured performance with that of the earlier amplifier. Like the VK-55SE, the VK-56SE has four output terminals for each channel, various pairs of which can be used to provide a feed from three different output-transformer taps labeled High, Med, and Low. I performed a complete set of measurements from each tap, but have concentrated on the Low outputs in this discussion, as those were the taps preferred by Herb Reichert.Both the small-signal and output tubes are delivered numbered, and I installed them from left to right, as instructed in the manual. The amplifiers maximum voltage gain from the High output tap was the same as the VK-55SEs and lower than the norm, at 24dB into 8 ohms. The gain from the Med tap was 23.2dB, and 23dB from the Low tap. Each output tap was non-inverting  , with pin 2 of the XLR jacks wired hot. The input impedance was very high—a good thing—at 155k ohms across the audioband.  The output impedance from the VK-56SEs High tap was both very high, at 6.7 ohms from low to high frequencies, and higher than that of the earlier amplifier. As a result of the Ohms law interaction between the high output impedances and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker, the amplifiers frequency response into this load varied by a very audible ±2.1dB from the High tap  . The output impedance was lower from the Med and Low taps, at 5.5 and 3.35 ohms, respectively. The response from the Low tap with our simulated loudspeaker varied by ±1.5dB  , compared with ±1.2dB for the VK-55SE. Into resistive loads, the VK-56SE offered a flat response in the audioband, with excellent channel matching and a wide small-signal bandwidth. The amplifiers ultrasonic response into 8 ohms didnt reach –3dB until 150kHz, which correlates with a very square squarewave response  . The waveforms risetimes are very short, and there is neither overshoot nor ringing.Fig.1 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms    .Fig.3 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation   was good, but not as good as that of the earlier amplifier, measuring >70dB in both directions below 3kHz, and decreasing to >58dB at the top of the audioband. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio, measured at the High output tap and taken with the input shorted, was good at 79.2dB ref. 1W into 8 ohms in the right channel. It was worse in the left channel, however, measuring 67.5dB. When A-weighted, these ratios respectively improved to 96.2 and 83.3dB. The ratios from the Low tap were 1-2dB worse. The reason for the difference between the channels ratios can be seen in  .4, which shows the spectrum of the amplifiers output as it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms from the High tap. Power-supply–related spuriae at 60 and 180Hz, and especially 120Hz, are up to 17dB higher in the left channel   than the right  . I checked the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer, but couldnt get any lower noise than is shown in this graph.Fig.4 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms    .Like the VK-55SE, the VK-56SE is specified as having a maximum output power of 55Wpc into 8 ohms   at 3% THD+noise. The VK-56SE delivered 60Wpc into 8 ohms from its High tap  , 59Wpc from the Med tap  , and 54Wpc from the Low tap, all at 3% THD+N. However, the distortion at lower powers was higher than I like to see, as can be seen in  .5, which plots the THD+N percentage against output power into 8 ohms from the High tap. The steady rise in THD with power before actual waveform clipping is reached suggests that this amplifier uses only a modest amount of loop negative feedback. The 4 ohms delivery from the High output was similar  , though the power at 1% THD+N dropped from 5.3Wpc into 8 ohms to 3.1Wpc into 4 ohms. The Med tap delivered slightly more power at 1% THD+N into 4 ohms  , and 54Wpc at 3% THD+N  . Fig.8 plots the THD+N percentage against output power from HRs preferred Low tap into 8 ohms, and shows that the low-level distortion is lower than from the other two taps, even into 4 ohms  . However, into 2 ohms from the Low tap  , the distortion at low powers was the same as from the High tap into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Med output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.9 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.10 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 2 ohms.The VK-55SEs two channels had differed in their small-signal linearity, which Id conjectured was due to our review samples tubes having had a lot of mileage on them. However, the VK-56SE behaved similarly. Fig.11 plots the THD+N percentage against frequency from the Low tap at 2.83V into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. Into the two higher impedances, the right channel   offered lower distortion in the midrange and treble than the left  , and into 2 ohms the left channels THD+N remained above 1%  . However, both channels offered higher levels of distortion as the frequency dropped, this presumably due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformers, and this behavior was more extreme from the High tap  .Fig.11 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Fig.12 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , 2 ohms  .Such high levels of distortion wont necessarily result in poor sound quality if the harmonics present are low-order. This would appear to be case from the waveform of the distortion content  , taken at 1W into 8 ohms from the High output, which appears to be predominantly second-harmonic in nature. This is confirmed by the spectrum of the VK-56SEs output at the same power from the Low tap  , though the third harmonic is only 7dB lower than the second. Although high-order harmonics are also present, these all lie at or below –80dB  .Fig.13 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, High output tap, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms  , 0.69% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.14 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1W into 8 ohms  .Finally, as implied by the fact that the distortion percentage doesnt rise at the top of the audioband in  .11, the VK-56SE did okay on the demanding twin-tone test of high-frequency intermodulation  . At 1Wpc into 8 ohms from the Low tap, the 1kHz difference tone was the highest in level, at –54dB   in the left channel   and –57dB   in the right  . As had been the case with the VK-55SE, the higher-frequency tones in this spectrum are surrounded by sideband pairs at ±120Hz and its harmonics, suggesting that the amplifiers power supply is being stressed under these conditions.Fig.15 Balanced Audio Technology VK-56SE, Low output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 1W peak into 8 ohms  .Overall, though the VK-56SE measured similarly to its predecessor, some aspects of its measured performance—the high output impedance, the differences in noise and linearity between channels—bothered me. But Im not surprised that HR preferred using the amplifiers Low output transformer taps; these give the best measured performance, especially into lower impedances, while preserving the \"tube amplifier\" character.

       " '  Western Electric 91E  . I carefully installed the tubes following the instructions in the excellent manual, and after turning on the amplifier, waited for the 91E to optimize the bias for the 300B output tubes. Once that was done, I waited another 30 minutes before starting the testing.The Western Electric 91E preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, from its loudspeaker, preamplifier, and headphone outputs. The volume control operated in accurate 0.5dB steps. A level of 1Wpc into 8 ohms was indicated as approximately –12dB on the front-panel meters. The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was a fairly low 29.6dB measured at the loudspeaker output into 8 ohms, 19.7dB from the headphone output, and –0.01dB from the preamplifier output, ie, an input of 1V resulted in an output of 998.5mV. The single-ended input impedance is specified as 20k ohms. I measured an inconsequentially lower value of 16.5k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 15.5k ohms at 20kHz.The headphone outputs source impedance was a relatively high 113 ohms across the audioband, which wont be optimal for low-impedance headphones. The loudspeaker output impedance was a high 3.3 ohms at 20Hz, falling slightly to 2.57 ohms at 1kHz and 20kHz. The variation in the Western Electric amplifiers small-signal frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was ±1.4dB, which would be audible. Into resistive loads  , the VTA-70 started to roll off above 10kHz, reaching –3dB at 35kHz. Fig.1 was taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control. The 91Es reproduction of a 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms   was superbly square. The ultrasonic rolloff lengthened the risetimes of a 10kHz squarewave  , though no overshoot or ringing is present.Fig.1 Western Electric 91E, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Western Electric 91E, small-signal 1kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Fig.3 Western Electric 91E, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The 91Es channel separation   was >60dB in both directions below 2kHz but decreased to 40dB at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio  , taken with the input shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum, was a good 79.7dB  . This ratio improved to 86.1dB when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 90.6dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Western Electric amplifier drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to maximum   revealed a low level of random noise, and the AC-related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics lay at or below –90dB.Fig.4 Western Electric 91E, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum    .Western Electric specifies the 91Es maximum power into 8 ohms as 20Wpc   at 10% THD, 16Wpc   at 5% THD, and 14Wpc   at 3% THD  . With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—and with both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of just 1.8Wpc into 8 ohms  . At 3% THD+N, I measured 9.23Wpc  , and at 10%, 12.8Wpc  . Slightly more power was available into 4 ohms  : 4.8Wpc   at 1% THD+N; 10Wpc   at 3% THD+N; and 14Wpc   at 10% THD+N. The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifier uses a very limited amount of loop negative feedback.Fig.5 Western Electric 91E, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Western Electric 91E, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency into 8 and 4 ohms at 1V. The THD+N rose slightly at the frequency extremes and was higher in the left channel into 8 ohms   but in the right channel into 4 ohms  . At 2.83V, which is equivalent to 1W into 8 ohms  , the distortion was close to 1% in both channels.Fig.7 Western Electric 91E, THD+N   vs frequency at 1V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.8 Western Electric 91E, THD+N   vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fortunately, the distortion waveform   was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic  , at 0.8%. The third harmonic was also present, albeit at a lower level, especially into 4 ohms  . By themselves, the second and third harmonics may not result in audible distortion, even at relatively high levels. However, this will only be true if they are not accompanied by intermodulation distortion. With the 91E driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 4 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay at –50dB  , with the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz 10dB lower in level. These products were all 5dB higher in level at 1W into 8 ohms  , which experience leads me to believe is marginal performance. It is fair to note, however, that this level of intermodulation is identical to that of the Air Tight ATM-300R power amplifier that Art Dudley favorably reviewed in February 2019  , which also used a single 300B tube for each channels output.Fig.9 Western Electric 91E, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 8 ohms, 0.8% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.10 Western Electric 91E, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 4 ohms  .Fig.11 Western Electric 91E, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 4 ohms  .  behavior of the Western Electrics phono input, I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the grounding lug on the rear panel, to obtain the lowest noise. The phono input inverted absolute polarity at all the outputs. I measured a maximum gain at 1kHz at the loudspeaker outputs of 71.5dB   and 82.1dB  . I performed all the subsequent testing using the headphone output and with the volume control set to –9.5dB, to avoid overloading the tubed output stage.   I repeated some of the testing at the preamplifier output.The input impedance was 42k ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, 34.3k ohms at 20kHz   and 993 ohms at 20Hz, 979 ohms at 1kHz, 968 ohms at 20kHz  . The phono inputs RIAA error was very low, with very good channel matching  , though the low and high frequencies rolled off a little, reaching –1dB at 35Hz and 20kHz. Set to MM, the wideband, unweighted S/N ratio with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to the maximum was a good 67dB  , ref. 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 79.7dB, while an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 84.2dB. The S/N ratios in MC mode were 10–12dB lower, but this is still a relatively quiet phono stage.Fig.12 Western Electric 91E, phono input, response with RIAA correction    .The phono input, measured at the headphone output, had high levels of distortion, with the second harmonic the highest in level at –44dB   with an input signal of 5mV. The harmonic distortion signature is very similar to that measured at the loudspeaker outputs, which makes me suspect that the headphone output is derived from the single-ended tubed output stage, most likely with a series resistor. I therefore repeated the spectral analysis at the preamplifier output  . Though high-order harmonics are visible, these all lie at or below –90dB  , and the second harmonic is now almost 50dB lower than it had been from the headphone output.Fig.13 Western Electric 91E, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 5mV input, measured at headphone output  .Fig.14 Western Electric 91E, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 5mV input, measured at Preamplifier output  .The high level of second harmonic distortion present in the headphone output affected the overload margin measurements. In MM mode, the margins, calculated from the difference between the nominal 1kHz input level of 5mV and the input voltage where the THD+N reached 1%, were disappointing, at 3.4dB at 20Hz, 4.2dB at 1kHz, and –8.4dB at 20kHz. The margins in MC mode, ref. 1kHz at 0.5mV, were all 0.5dB lower. However, repeating the overload margin measurements at the preamplifier output gave an 8dB improvement at 20Hz and 1kHz in both MM and MC mode, though the margins at 20kHz were still low.The Western Electric 91E is an intriguing mix of modern technology—the computer-optimized tube biasing, the precision volume control, the front-panel meters—and almost-century-old tube technology. Its measured performance is what I would expect from an amplifier with a single-ended output stage that uses a single 300B tube. Given its high levels of both harmonic and intermodulation distortion, even at lowish powers, it will work best with loudspeakers that have a 4 ohm nominal impedance and high sensitivity. Footnote 1: Kudos to Western Electric for reporting the THD level at which maximum output power is measured.—Jim AustinFootnote 2: I created tracks on Stereophiles Test CD 2 so listeners could hear at what percentage of second, third, or seventh harmonic they become aware of the distortion.

       " '  Audio Note Meishu Phono Tonmeister  . The tubes were already installed when I received the review sample. I removed the cover to check for proper installation. All was well. I waited for 30 minutes after powering up the amplifier before starting the testing.Looking first at its line inputs, the Meishu Tonmeister preserved absolute polarity, ie, was noninverting, from both the 4 ohm and 8 ohm output transformer taps. The maximum voltage gain at 1kHz was a moderately low 29.65dB from the 4 ohm tap into 8 ohms and 31.3dB from the 8 ohm tap into the same load. The input impedance is specified as 100k ohms. I measured a still-high 77k ohms at 20Hz, 74.5k ohms at 1kHz, and 63.7k ohms at 20kHz.The source impedance from the 8 ohm output tap was a high 3.2 ohms at 20Hz and 1kHz, increasing slightly to 3.45 ohms at 20kHz. The variation in the small-signal frequency response with this output with our standard simulated loudspeaker   was therefore high, at ±1.8dB. The variation was lower from the 4 ohm tap, at ±1.1dB  , but with both output taps, there will be audible modifications of loudspeaker responses with almost all loudspeakers. Into resistive loads  , the Audio Note amplifiers output started to roll off below 40Hz and above 20kHz, reaching –3dB at 9Hz and 55kHz. Figs.1 & 2 were taken with the volume control set to its maximum; the excellent channel matching was preserved at lower settings of the control. There is the slightest hint of a resonant peak at 60kHz in the Meishu Tonmeisters frequency response, which correlated with some damped ultrasonic ringing in the amplifiers reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms  .Fig.1 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, line input, 8 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.2 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, line input, 4 ohm output tap, frequency response at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load  , 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  , and 2 ohms    .Fig.3 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.The Meishu Tonmeisters channel separation   was moderate, at 49dB, R–L, and 36dB, L–R, at 1kHz, respectively decreasing to 23dB and 40dB at 20kHz. The unweighted, wideband signal/noise ratio   taken from the 8 ohm taps with the inputs shorted to ground and the volume control set to its maximum was 69.7dB  . This ratio improved slightly to 71.5dB, left, and 69.6dB, right, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to 22Hz–22kHz, and to 86.7dB when A-weighted. With their lower gain, the ratios from the 4 ohm outputs were 1.3dB greater.Spectral analysis of the low-frequency noisefloor while the Audio Notes 8 ohm taps drove a 1kHz tone at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with the volume control set to the maximum   revealed a low level of random noise. However, AC supply–related spuriae at 60Hz and its odd- and even-order harmonics were present. The highest of these, at 120Hz, lay at –76dB  . Its level didnt change when I experimented with the grounding between the amplifier and the Audio Precision analyzer.Fig.4 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1Wpc into 8 ohms with volume control set to its maximum    .Audio Note specifies the Meishu Tonmeisters maximum power as 8W into both 4 and 8 ohms  , though no distortion percentage is mentioned. With our usual definition of clipping—when the THD+noise reaches 1%—and with both channels driven, I measured a clipping power of just 1Wpc from the 8 ohm tap into 8 ohms   and from the 4 ohm tap into 4 ohms  . At 3% THD+N, I measured 4.8Wpc with each output tap matched to the load, and at 10%, 12.2Wpc from the 8 ohm tap   and from the 4 ohm tap  , again with the taps matched to the loads. Less power was available from the 8 ohm tap into 4 ohms, but with the 4 ohm tap driving 8 ohms  , 5.75Wpc was available at 3% THD+N and 10Wpc at 10%  . The shape of the traces in these graphs suggests that the amplifiers circuit doesnt use loop negative feedback. It is also fair to note that the waveform wasnt actually clipped at these high levels of distortion; instead, it was asymmetrically rounded off.Fig.5 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.6 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.Fig.7 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 4 ohm output tap, distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Figs.5–7 indicate that the lowest distortion at low power is obtained from the 4 ohm transformer tap. Fig.8 shows how the percentage of THD+N in both channels varied with frequency with this tap driving 8 and 4 ohms at 1V. The THD+N rose slightly at low frequencies and was significantly higher into 4 ohms   than it was into 8 ohms  . At the same level from the 8 ohm tap  , the distortion across the audioband was close to 0.5% into 8 ohms and 1% into 4 ohms.Fig.8 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 4 ohm output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 1V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .Fig.9 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, THD+N   vs frequency at 1V into: 8 ohms  , 4 ohms  .The distortion waveform   was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic, with higher-order harmonics progressively lower in level  . However, the levels of the third, fifth, and seventh harmonics were higher at low frequencies  , which will probably be due to the onset of core saturation in the output transformers.Fig.10 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, left channel, 1kHz waveform at 0.5W into 8 ohms, 0.72% THD+N  ; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  .Fig.11 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, at 1V into 8 ohms  .Fig.12 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 4 ohm output tap, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 1V into 8 ohms  .Due to masking, in itself the level of the second harmonic may not result in audible distortion, but this will only be true if it is not accompanied by intermodulation distortion. With the Meishu Tonmeisters 4 ohm taps driving an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 1Wpc peak into 8 ohms  , the 1kHz difference product lay just below –50dB  , with the higher-order products at 18 and 21kHz 10dB lower in level. This is marginal performance, in my opinion.Fig.13 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, 8 ohm output tap, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz at 1Wpc peak into 4ohms  .  behavior of the Audio Notes phono input, I connected a wire from the Audio Precisions ground terminal to the amplifiers chassis ground post on its rear panel to obtain the lowest noise. The phono input preserved absolute polarity and the maximum gain at 1kHz was 67.8dB at the 8 ohm outputs and 66.14dB at the 4 ohm outputs. The gain was fixed at 36.4dB at the single-ended Source output, so, to avoid damaging the amplifiers output stage,   phono inputs behavior at the Source output with the volume control set to its minimum.The input impedance is specified as 47k ohms. I measured 48k ohms at 20Hz, 37.5k ohms at 1kHz, but just 8k ohms at 20kHz. The phono inputs RIAA equalization was very accurate, with excellent channel matching  , though the low frequencies rolled off a little, reaching –3dB at 16Hz. The wideband, unweighted S/N ratio with the inputs shorted to ground was a good 64dB in both channels, ref. 1kHz at 5mV. Restricting the measurement bandwidth to the audioband increased the ratio to 68.9dB, while an A-weighting filter further increased the ratio to 76dB. Negligible power supply–related spuriae were present in the phono stages noisefloor  ; this is a relatively quiet phono stage.Fig.14 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, phono input, response with RIAA correction, measured at Source output    .Fig.15 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–1kHz, for 5mV input, measured at Source output  .The low-frequency and midrange overload margins, calculated from the difference between the nominal 1kHz input level of 5mV and the input voltage where the THD+N reached 1%, were superbly high, at 37.8dB at 20Hz and 32dB at 1kHz. The margin at 20kHz was lower at 14dB. The phono inputs harmonic distortion was respectably low in level, with the second harmonic the highest in level at –60dB  . With the relatively low overload margin at the top of the audioband, I wasnt surprised to find that the second-order difference product with an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones peaking at 25mV lay at –40dB  . High-order intermodulation products were vanishingly low in level, however, until I increased the signal level by 10dB.Fig.16 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, MM phono input, spectrum of 1kHz sinewave, DC–10kHz, for 5mV input, measured at Source output  .Fig.17 Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phono, MM phono input, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–30kHz, 19+20kHz for 25mV input  .The Audio Note Meishu Tonmeister Phonos measured performance is what I would expect from an amplifier with a single-ended output stage that uses a single 300B tube for each channel. In this respect, its behavior resembles that of the Western Electric Type No.91E integrated amplifier that Ken Micallef reviewed in November 2022.           ',\n",
       " \" Topping LA90 Discrete balanced stereo amplifier.   costs US $799.The case is the same as the IC-based Topping LA90 which is fine with me given its high quality look and feel.  The power switch doubles as input selector once the unit is on.  Volume control can be bypassed using switch in the back:As before, power is provided by a hefty, 64 volt switching power supply rated at 4 amps  .  The amplifier as you see is all balanced with three inputs.  You have a selection of low and high gains  .  It can be bridged and nicely tolerates even 4 ohm loads in that mode.  Trigger is provided to enable one power switch to turn on a series of devices.Note that this is a traditional amplifier and not class D.  There is no remote so if you need that, you have to use a DAC/pre-amp with that capability.Topping LA90 Discrete MeasurementsThere is a lot to measure here given the fact that we have dual gains and bridge mode.  Let's work our way through it starting with low gain in stereo mode:Incredibly, the LA90 Discrete matches the performance of its IC based unit, landing on its perch on top of all other amplifiers ever tested:Switching to high gain costs you a few dBs but you are still ahead the competition:So feel free to use this mode.  Noise performance continues to be superb:Frequency response is flat of course and load independent:Crosstalk is better than average amplifier but is a step down from the regular LA90:Multitone showcases the superbly low distortion levels:Let's see how we are doing in power department starting with 4 ohms:We wind up good bit more power at 70 watts   while giving up nothing in spectacular noise and distortion department.  Allowing for more distortion gets us more power:8 Ohm performance follows the same path:Tests so far have been at 1 kHz   so let's vary that and see what happens:In a word, wow!  The amplifier simply doesn't care what frequency you throw out it!  This is a quite a step ahead of normal LA90 which itself was state of the art.Power on is silent but off may create a faint noise depending on your speaker sensitivity:Warm up showed one channel struggling a bit but later I found the power connector not fully tight so maybe that was the cause:Regardless, it behaved correctly after a minute.Topping LA90 Discrete Bridged MeasurementsAs with normal LA90, bridge mode still provides superb performance:The name of the game is power though so let's see what we get into 4 ohm:Notice how we get more power but distortion is nowhere to be found until we clip.Wow!  This makes a great case for using a pair of these amps.  You get so much power out of each one, rivalling much larger amplifiers.Reactive Load TestingThe LA90 has a very sharp clipping point.  This means that it goes from vanishingly low distortion to full clipping.  Combine this with aggressive protection circuit which shuts the unit off and you have the make up of a system that can't be measured in batch mode as my Powercube setup uses.  If I set the voltage for 8 ohm load, then it causes the amp to shut down when driven at 4 ohm.  Good news is that the amplifier doesn't care about reactive loads.  Here are the results for 8 ohm for example:Code:Maximum Output4/11/202312:13 AMMaximum Output Level ResultsSelected Load    Ch1      Ch2      8 Ohm; 60 deg Capacitive    21.2    21.3    8 Ohm; 30 deg Capacitive    21.1    21.2    8 Ohm; 0 deg Resistive    21.0    21.0    8 Ohm; 30 deg Inductive    20.2    20.3    8 Ohm; 60 deg Inductive    20.9    21.0I could not get a similar output at 4 ohm due to limitation of the instrumentation as stated above.  But if I drove the parameters manually, I could get it to tolerate reactive loads just as well.Selecting 2 ohm caused the protection circuit to kick in.  I didn't have time to mess with that.I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get this test done with the amplifier being pushed to clipping and shut down probably 50 to 100 times.  Even though the case got pretty warm, the amp continued to function without complaining. ConclusionsTraditionally in high-end audio when a company says they are using discrete designs, I get prepared for bad performance.  Topping once again proves that this is no barrier for their designers.  The discreate LA90 not only matches the exemplary performance of the IC based LA90, but betters it in power handling, producing more power  .  Pushing noise and distortion down in our top tier performance is very hard but Topping has no problem maintaining its significant lead over even best of the best amplifiers.  Their skills and execution in this regard leaves me speechless.Needless to say, it is my absolute pleasure to add Topping LA90 Discrete to my recommended list.  Today is a happy day!  P.S.  Power amplifiers are least reliable audio products  .  New designs sometimes need to prove themselves in this regard.  So if you are risk averse, please don't be the first to purchase this amplifier. \",\n",
       " ' Topping LA90 integrated amplifier.   costs US $800.I must say, this is one interesting industrial design. Everything oozes style despite the diminutive package.  This aspect continues in the operation of the unit with the sound of the relays solidly clicking indicating something good is going to happen.  Here is the side view:While quite solid, you can pick it up with one hand.  The small size is aided by a massive external switching power supply:Here are its ratings:Back to the unit, you can see three balanced inputs.  Volume control can be bypassed although I did not do so for my testing. You can also operate LA90 in bridged mono mode.  There is also 12 volt trigger.There are to gain settings.  One at 10 dB and another at 20 dB  .Topping LA90 MeasurementsThese are non-bridged mode measurements.  Bridged setup follows this section.  Let\\'s start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm in low gain mode:I don\\'t need to tell you that this is a stunning level of achievement.  We have a power amplifier producing almost the same SINAD as a state of the art DAC!  Using this number, LA90 grabs the top spot with ease with a nice gap to boot:Here it is zoomed:You might be thinking that it can only do so with low gain but that is not true.  Even in high gain performance is spectacular:It would still achieve top spot in our rankings and achieve full audible transparency.Not only is distortion vanishingly low, so is noise level:Frequency response is flat and wide as expected:Being class AB design, it has no load dependency.Crosstalk is incredibly good although it loses a tiny bit relative to last champ of amplifiers:Multitone test shows the very low distortion levels:Let\\'s see how much power we have:So power is modest in non-bridged mode.  But note how good the high gain mode is so I would feel just fine using that for operation of the unit if you need to.  Allowing distortion to rise to 1% naturally gets us more power:Here is 8 ohm:Oops.  \"High Power\" should be \"High Gain.\"Changing frequencies shows the same excellent performance:Despite being pushed deep into clipping, the amplifier did not complain until I got to 20 Hz where its over temperature shut it down.Finally, you don\\'t need any warm up:Topping LA90 Bridged Mode PerformanceA shorting wire is provided to connect the two negative speaker bindings together allowing bridged mode from the top two posts.  Here is our dashboard again:Performance is still exceptional.  Here is our SNR:Due to more power available now, we cross the amazing 140 dB SNR threshold.  What this says is that even if you play at 140 dB, the noise level will be at or below threshold of hearing!  Of course there is not enough power there to do that but basically you know that noise is not part of the equation with LA90 as even 5 watt measurement hits below threshold of hearing.We want to know the power increase though so here it is  :Now we get good bit of power at 95 watts with almost no penalty relative to non-bridged mode.  Notice the massive gap as far as noise floor relative to Purifi amplifier.Allowing for 1% distortion we get:Here is the super wideband spectrum of the amplifier while producing 5 watts:Edit:Power Tests at 2 Ohm   and 4 Ohm  Requests were made to test the amplifier beyond its minimum load impedance specs.  Let\\'s start with 2 ohm load while driving one channel in stereo mode.  Dashboard still shows superb performance:Let\\'s now sweep the power:You don\\'t get extra power relative to 4 ohm but the amplifier was stable and did not even go into protection. Now let\\'s switch to Bridged mode   and run our power sweep again:Now we see the amplifier \"doubling down\" producing nearly 200 watts into 4 ohm.  Again, the amplifier was well composed and kept driving into clipping region without complaining, or shutting down.Again, the above tests are beyond the amplifier specifications and tests I never run as such.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping engineers are bringing their expertise in designing ultra low noise and distortion in headphone amplification to power amplifiers.  As such, they have outdone every amplifier I have measured in that regard, getting ahead to capture the #1 position with a large gap to #2 choice.The amplifier is not for everyone though. Power level is modest as compared to competitors.  And you have that large external power supply.  My wish is another version of this amp with built-in power supply, motorized volume control with bridge mode standard.  For now, we need to celebrate one of the most important development in delivering transparent, high fidelity amplification to audiophiles in a very attractive package.It is my absolute pleasure to recommend the Topping LA90.

The only other board is the Ncore standard interface board.   The gain as set is almost 12 dB.  EDIT: see follow up below review for with buffer   performance.Here is a close up:Note that this board includes a pre-amp  .  I am testing per above in unbuffered mode.During use the amplifier as a whole was extremely stable and never changed its temperature, nor did it go into protection mode.  A sole XLR connection is the input to the unit.  All fits in this nice compact box.Hypex NCx500 Buffer Bypass Amplifier MeasurementsI let the unit warm up for a while but was not needed as it was stable as soon as powered up:It did reach a plateau around 11 minutes though as you see.  But note that the vertical scale is 0.1 dB.Now on to our dashboard of 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Distortion is provably inaudible at -120 dB.  A bit of noise sags that down to 113 dB which is still superb performance, landing it at #2 best amplifier every tested:Noise performance is exceptional:Even when listening to 16 bit content at 5 watts, you have an extra 10 dB of noise margin!  This is one quiet amplifier.Frequency response is wide and load invariant which is a great attribute not existing in all class D designs:Multitone test shows off its low distortion yet again:I must say, I was not prepared for the amp to beat the reference Benchmark AHB2 in noise level in our power test:EDIT: I re-ran the power sweeps again with tighter load terminals which resulted in much lower distortion levels especially at 4 ohm:Despite massive amount of power the NCx500 produces, its distortion is now close to the best we have ever measured!I updated these max and peak measurements again which produced more power:Company specs this power level even at 2 ohm so I tested that:This is one powerful amplifier!Here is our updated 8 ohm power:I was surprised how much lower its noise level is compared to Purifi 1ET400A reference design.  Maybe that amp was not running at such a low gain setting though  .  Still, this is once again superb performance.Sweeping with different frequencies we see various distortion mechanisms kicking in  :There is some rise in distortion with frequency but this is to be expected.Finally, here is the pop on and off noises.  Keep in mind that this is a reference design and the on/off switch turns the whole unit on and on as opposed to soft power:Hypex NCx500 Buffered MeasurementsAs noted, there is integrated buffer   in this module.  I activated it which boosted the gain to 27 dB.  Maximum power is now achieved at around 2.2 volts which is well within the output of many well designed DACs using balanced out.  Here is our new dashboard:Distortion has gone down a bit but we have picked up a bit of power supply noise.  Despite that hit, performance is still state of the art:As noted, SNR has gone down but still excellent:Multitone is mostly the same but impacted by the power supply noise:Frequency response is the same:As noted distortion is lower:On/Off noise is impacted a bit:ConclusionsHypex amplifiers have always enjoyed great performance in our testing.  It is wonderful to see the company innovating and increasing the performance of their high power NC500 platform.  You no longer have to compromise between available power and superb technical performance.  You can have both.It is my pleasure to recommend the Hypex NCx500 OEM amplifier module.

       " \" Hypex Nilai500DIY class D amplifier module with PS500DIY power supply. Parts were provided by the company and member @Rick Sykora was kind enough to assemble it:As indicated, the single channel amplifier is on the left and the power supply on the right. The amplifier has built-in preamp providing three levels of gain  . A jumper selects the appropriate level.  At 12 dB, you need about 12 volts to reach full power which requires a pro audio interface or a pre-amp with that level of output.  The sole input in this con uration is balanced.In use the amplifier was exceptionally solid even when pushed hard.  It kept going and stayed very cool.  It is rated to 2 ohm  .Edit: in the original review I had the top open so I could change the gain settings.  Alas, it turns out that doing so allowed some noise pick up around 10 kHz.  I re-tested with the lid closed and that issue went away.  As a results, we have slightly better performance especially in high-gain.Hypex Nilai500DIY MeasurementsLet's start with lowest gain setting:That is superb performance with distortion at or below -140 dB!  Here is the response at higher grain settings:With all thee gain settings, the amp lands in our top 20 best amplifiers ever reviewed based on combined noise and distortion rating  :Noise performance is excellent but just shy of state of the art:But gets there at full power:As we expect from Hypex, frequency response is load impedance independent:Multitone performance is excellent:Amplifier is stable on power up:Let's look at available power at 4 ohm:Looks like we no longer have to decided between superbly low noise and distortion and available power!  State of the art performance is once again achieved in low gain while still producing lots of power  .  Allowing distortion to climb to 1% naturally gives us more power  :We still have healthy power even with 8 ohm load:Since the amp is rated at 2 ohm, I measured that as well:There is a bit of penalty but still great performance.  Seems power supply is limiting power so you don't get more juice.I was a bit surprised at the ballooning of the distortion at higher frequencies:EDIT:There is more of a noticeable pop on power off than power on:As requested, here is the switching response:ConclusionsIt is clear Hypex is taking competition in class D amplifiers seriously responding with a DIY friend amplifier solution that has a ton of power and wonderful performance.  While we could nitpick here and there, but in the larger context of the amplifiers out there, this is a superb offering of great performance and lots and lots of power.FYI I don't have pricing for the kit.

Having the power switch be slightly different color or shape may help with this.There are a set of LEDs that show the status of the amplifier.  They are driven by an FPGA   that monitors all aspects of the amplifier and shuts down the unit if stressed.  It did so very quickly and efficiently in my testing.  Usually this is done with purely analog or maybe a small microprocessor.  As such, the coverage of scenarios that could damage the amplifier is much less complete than using the approach Benchmark is using in AHB2.Here is the back panel:This is a very minimalistic approach given the small amount of real estate available.  Only input is XLR balanced which is just fine in my book.  A gain switch allows the input level to be controlled so that you can just use an RCA to XLR adapter and still get full power  .  At the other extreme, the low gain setting is designed for professional pre-amps with lots of output, getting its max power at 9.8 volts.  Using this scheme, the signal to noise ratio can be improved as you will see in measurements later.For speaker terminals there are two sets: classic heavy duty banana jacks and SpeakOn.  The SpeakOn are locking and provide the best performance.  I lost about 3 dB of performance using the banana jacks due to less secure connect there.  So the measurements you see are with SpeakOn jacks.Another minor nit on that note: I had a rather cheap SpeakOn cable and its plug was just large enough to hit the silver screws that the sockets are mounted with.  Typical round shaped SpeakOn ones are not an issue.  Flush mount screws would solve this problem.There is a switch for selecting stereo or mono bridged output.  The latter quadruples the amount of power available and unlike typical bridging, according to Benchmark comes at no penalty in distortion!  I plan to test this later as it has a minimum impedance of 6 ohm so I could not use the 4 ohm setup I used for this testing.There is a very beefy AC mains cable with really nice locking tabs.  Insert it and it stays put unless you push the two red tabs on each side.  Nothing is more aggravating than the AC cable coming half-way lose from the IEC socket.Being a proper company of course the AHB2 comes with full set of regulatory/safety/emissions certifications which is super important with power amplifiers given the high voltages and currents running around in them.In use the AHB2 stays very cool for a power amplifier when it is idling, outputting little power which was a nice surprise.As to THX technology, it merges a low-power but very low distortion amplifier with a high power but higher distortion amplifier.  The distortion of the latter is not seen because it is producing so much power  .  The general scheme is not new, dating back to 1980s but new implementation is.  We have seen this in stellar performance of Massdrop THX AAA 789 amplifier which broke new ground in level of distortion and noise. Will the Benchmark AHB2 manage the same?  Let\\'s see.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my 5 watt output test using 4 ohm load using SpeakOn terminals as noted:I hope your jaw is on the floor just like mine was when I saw this picture emerge!    113 dB THD+N in a power amplifier?  Are you kidding me?Look at the harmonic distortion.  The worst case spike is below -130 dB!  This is insanely good.  Of course this type of SINAD   crowns the Benchmark AHB2 as the best I have ever tested:The performance was so good I literally had to rebuild my dummy load to get there.  Even the quality of the metal used in the connectors matters to get to this level of distortion.  I replace all my dummy loads with higher precision ones that have much less VCR  .  Resistor values can become voltage dependent creating distortions of their own.  Up to about 105 dB of THD+N, it doesn\\'t matter but beyond that, the VCR was the dominant distortion, not the Benchmark AHB2 amplifier!It was requested that I show the breakdown and distortion so here we are:Our best case hearing threshold is -116 dB SPL so no question that this level of distortion is totally inaudible.  Separating the noise from THD, we see that it is noise that we are measuring as THD+N, rather than distortion:And this is with exceptional noise performance of Benchmark AHB2 as we see in the graph of THD+N versus power:Even in high gain, the AHB2 easily outperforms the DIY Hypex NC400 I had tested before which used to be the best amp I had tested.We have 185 watts of power at incredibly low distortion of 0.00016%, besting the company specifications.Note that the FPGA protection mode kicks in and essentially shots the amplifier down past the limit.  You get absolutely distortion-less and noiseless performance until there is no more.EDIT: here is performance in bridged mode using same 4 ohm load:You get 500 watts of stunningly clean power.  Protection circuit shut the unit down after that so it is quite safe to try.  With a THD essentially matching the non-bridged mode, there is no reason to be afraid of trying this.Intermodulation distortion versus power level shows the same story of clean power:If you want to know what you get for extra money over bargain amplifiers, you can see the difference in the above graph.  We are not talking about 5 to 10 dB but whopping 40 dB better!I have had requests for intermodulation distortion using dual 19 and 20 kHz tones.  Here is that:THD+N versus output level looks far cleaner than anything I have tested before:Even at the limit of our hearing  , we have vanishingly low amount of distortion.  The graph is exaggerated so shows a rise there but in absolute levels, despite 90 kHz bandwidth of the test, we have incredibly low THD+N of just .004%.The sharp spike at 45 Hz in green shows the amplifier going into protection mode.  So don\\'t pump that sine wave continuously into it at 133 watts.  Frequency response is exceptional too as expected:Since this is not a switching amplifier, there is no filter there allowing the bandwidth to go to 200 kHz and beyond.  Lowest band of AM radio is 450 kHz so likely you could use the AHB2 for an AM radio transmitter!  Usually when we test switching amplifiers we see all kind of \"interesting\" things in their outputs above hearing range.  The AHB2 is a classic con uration albeit, with a switching power supply so all is well and clean here:My reference graph for the Hypex NC400 used an AES filter   so I ran the AHB2 both ways, with or without that filter.  Using the filter   so the two are equal, we see much cleaner spectrum below 200 kHz and of course, no massive switching spikes.  Worst case spike is below -115 dB.  In other words, the Benchmark AHB2 is clean even in the areas you are not looking!  It is like a restaurant scrubbing their parking lot with soap and pad as well as their dishes.  My loose wires on dummy loads is not the best setup for measuring crosstalk but here it is anyway:Where our hearing is most sensitive  , separation is around 100 dB which is way, way more than we need.  Despite the small enclosure, the AHB2 manages exceptional numbers here.EDIT: forgot to run the classic SNR test in the original review:Wow, assuming you play at peak of 120 dBSPL, your noise floor will be at -10 dBSPL!  That is absolute silence.ConclusionsIt goes without saying that the Benchmark AHB2 breaks new ground with respect to performance of power amplifiers.  Using it, you can be assured that any distortion that you hear is from other sources  .  This is what I look for in high-end audio: absolutely the best performance so no second guessing is involved. You buy once, and you are happy forever!All of this comes from a company that is a model of transparency with proper and accurate measurements of their products on their site.  And importantly, volunteering to have that data shown to be correct by independent sources such as us.  Support form the company for me at least has also been exceptional.Yes, $3,000 is fair bit of money but is pocket change in high-end audio.  Sales tax is higher than $3,000 for most of those products!  I hear a lot of talk from audiophiles to have the equipment get out of the way of enjoying the music.  Well the Benchmark AHB2 at levels that assuredly passes full transparency.  So if that is your moto, you better stop buying boutique products with no specs and independent measurements and get an AHB2.  Everything you hear then will be what is in your source, not the dirty dishes that your amp my serve your food on.Needless to say, the Benchmark AHB2 gets my strongest recommendation for power amplifier.  The pink panther agrees, having hit the ball out of the park after I took that shot! -',\n",
       " \" Audiophonics HPA-S400ET.   after member request and costs 1 490,00 €  .I must say this is one of the best packaging of class D amplifiers   that I have seen!  It is slick and has style.  While the heatsink on one side is cosmetic, the other is connected to the power supply power transistors although in use nothing rose above room temperature.  Back panel shows extremely high quality speaker connections:You can see it better with the lid open:I must say, this is so clean you can eat of of it!    I simply cannot find any fault with the assembly and design.  Bottom to modules are Purifi 1ET400A modules fed by their own custom buffer/pre-amp gain stage.  Jumpers let you select from different settings  .Audiophonics HPA-S400ET MeasurementsGiven the three different gain stages, it was a challenge to decide what to test so that this job doesn't become nearly infinite in scope.  I will first show you the dashboard for all three gains starting from high gain:This is superb performance already with distortion products at -125 dB.  Channel matching is excellent.  Here is medium gain petformance:This is a nice setting as max power is achieved at 4 volts meaning you can use all of our modern/desktop amps to drive the unit and gain a bit of performance.If you have a pro interface that goes up to 10 volts out, you can utilize the low gain mode:This gain is actually close to how I measured our two top performers   so let's see how the Audiophonics ranks:Looking at top 20 we see:Amazing performance!  Measuring SNR at low and medium gain we get:OK, from here on I am going to stick with low gain mode.  Here is our multitone:Stellar as expected.  Crosstalk manages to actually land in #1 position of any amplifier tested:Frequency response is dead flat with no load dependency:Let's sweep and see how we do with 4 ohm load:Excellent performance.  Here is how much power we get if we allow more distortion:Switching to 8 ohm we see that the performance actually exceeds than of Purifi  :Testing at other frequencies we still have great performance:Finally, the amplifier is stable at power up so no need to wait for it to warm up:ConclusionsThe Audiophonics HPA-S400ET comes in a beautiful package with super performance to match its good looks. Yes, it builds on Purifi's excellent platform but they managed to add value without messing with its performance.  The gain settings are well thought through.  The whole thing is so well executed and must be a delight to our European members who can buy it locally.  Having been built in France, it is also a feather in the cap of our French members.  I am happy to give my strongest recommendation to Audiophonics HPA-S400ET.  You have a lot of power with superb fidelity and transparency.Edit: video review just posted: \",\n",
       " ' TP   RA3 stereo balanced rackmount amplifier.   costs US $229.Yes, this is a new sub-brand from Topping.  I quite like it.  The large and highly visible volume level is as gorgeous to look at as it is responsive.  A remote control is provided which is something you don\\'t usually get.  The remote   allow you to select between RCA and XLR input:For those of us who have a DAC and an analog source, this is all that we need.Lots of nice touches are there such as independent memory for the volume setting for RCA vs XLR.  Safe volume settings.  Trigger support and ability to update firmware in the future.  Love that despite low cost, the power supply is built in.  You have a hard power switch which puts the unit in standby.  Push the volume knob or the remote button and it powers on.This line of products, at least for now, will be sold by Topping direct.  Alas, it is not yet on the website so you may have to wait a bit to order it.I don\\'t know anything about the design but based on measurements below, it seems to be a highly optimized class D chip architecture.TP RA3 Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Distortion is kept below threshold of audibility at around -116 dB.  So noise is the only thing we need to worry about.  There, when combined with distortion, nicely lands RA3 in our top 20 best amplifiers ever tested:Mind you, noise performance is excellent:Survey of available music indicates best case dynamic range of 18 bits and TP RA3 gives you that at just 5 watts!  Allow it to go to its max power and it reaches 20 bits.Multitone showcases the very low distortion in mid frequencies where our hearing is most sensitive:But if you insist on pumping ear deafening high frequency tones into it in the form of 19 and 20 kHz tones, you naturally get more distortion:A concern with low cost class D amp ICs is load   dependency.  Topping has worked hard to make that basically a non-issue:Crosstalk is incredibly good, besting even our reference:Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm:As noted, measurements completely match Topping spec of 130 watts at 1% THD+N.  Not boundless power but very good for many.  Naturally we lose good bit of power if you have a rare 8 ohm speaker:Varying the frequency we do see the class D chip amp create more distortion above 5 kHz or so:There is a bit of a noise spike with power off:There is some inconsequential spikes in one channel in the first short minutes as the amplifier warms up:Speaking of that, the amplifier didn\\'t feel to be rising above room temperature in my testing -- on top anyway.Finally, here is the efficiency vs output power  :Idle power while on is about 9 watts. The protection circuit is aggressive in the way it shuts the unit down when pushed hard so I did not try to run my reactive load tests.ConclusionsIt is remarkable to me how Topping is not only capable of producing new product one after the other, they do so while striving for state of the art in performance.  This is so even though they are bound by the capabilities of the class D chip amplifier they are using.  I really like the larger form factor as it not only allows better dissipation of heat and inclusion of AC power supply, but also makes the unit more substantial and \"professional looking.\"  If they made the rack ears optional, they would fit nicely in a home system as well.Feature set is great for this class of product with inclusion of remote control, trigger support, nice and visible volume level, etc.It is my pleasure to add TP RA3 to my recommended list.  Incredible performance for so little money.  ',\n",
       " ' Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp with the optional Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage.  With that option, the cost is £1,979.00 excluding VAT.  This translates into US $2,554.  The unit was purchased new and drop shipped to me by a kind member.  I had previously measured the reference design from Purifi so will be good to see how this version rates with a different input stage.The Nord dual monoblock comes in a very attractive enclosure  :Efficiency of class D amplifiers and switchmode power supply enables such slim case to be used.  There are two rows of heatsinks on the sides but they are decorative for the most part.  I will do a teardown separately.  For now, the amplifiers dissipate heat into the bottom of the chassis and dual power supplies have their own heatsinks inside the box.The back panel shows seriously beefy and nice feeling speaker connectors:When I received the unit, it immediately shut down.  The reason was a blown fuse.  I replaced it with a spare that comes in the IEC holder.  That worked for all but my last test which is the strenuous power vs frequency.  I have let Colin know that I think the fuse amperage needs to be increased given our low operating voltage in US.  Note that with music you are not going to hit this easily so it is more of an issue of lab/stress testing.  I don\\'t have a higher amp fuse to try with it until a batch arrives on Monday.  The fuse is the smaller 5x25mm which I only have a few of in low amperage  .Edit: turns out the fuse that was sent for was for 240 volt countries.  A \"slo-blow\" 10 amp replacement fuse was sent and worked fine.Other than this, the amplifier was solid in its performance never shutting down or complaining.  The enclosure didn\\'t even get warmer than room temperature.  Inclusion of two power supplies here relieves my worry of a the power supply being the weak link, not the amplifier.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 Ohm at 1 kHz:This is right on the money as far as THD+N and hence SINAD:Which is great news of course.Noise performance also matched the Purifi reference design:We have a very low distortion and very low noise floor.  This is all that you would want to ask an amplifier.  That, and power so let\\'s see how it does there:Dual power supplies don\\'t give you more power as we are essentially matching the reference design with one power supply.I was surprised to see a rise in distortion with one channel worse than the other.  Is this the Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage in play or were we given better evaluation samples at announcement?  We won\\'t know until we test another amp that uses Purifi gain stage.Same issue exists at 8 ohm although not as exaggerated:This makes me think the issue may be in the amplifier.Note that this is not an audible concern so don\\'t jump off the cliff please.  We see an exaggerated version of the same in intermodulation distortion relative to input level:Frequency response is flat and similar to reference design:Sweeps of power versus frequency gives us varying curves  :We see that at 20 Hz where we need most power, we have least amount of it.  This is typical of amplifiers since 20 Hz tone changes slowly not giving a chance for power supply capacitors to recharge between cycles.Finally here is the 19+20 kHz at the same 5 watt power of Purifi reference design:The pair around the main tone are identical to reference design.  Noise floor is a hair higher but that is probably run to run variation.ConclusionsThe Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp is an attractive build of the Purifi class D amplifier technology.  The dual mono con uration raises the price fair but but my belief is that it will last a lot longer than the single power supply version.  Measured performance is just a bit worse than Purifi reference design as power increases beyond 25 watts or so.  Not an audible difference but would be good to  ure out where this is coming from.  I can\\'t detect any improvement from Sonic Imagery discrete 990enh opamps.  So personally I would go with the stock gain stage and save enough money for a night out alone.I am happy to recommend the Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amplifier.  It builds on state-of-the-art Purifi amplifier modules and delivers it in nice packaging. -As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.The Pink Panthers are making up their Christmas list and I can tell you it is going to be a long, long list.

       " ' Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amplifier. With the options as tested, the cost is US $4,212.  As the name indicates, the amp is based on Hypex NC1200 class D amplifiers plus some value add in the form of Sonic Imagery 990Enh buffers, very fancy speaker terminals and even directional fuse from Synergistic Research!The enclosure is the same elegant design I have tested before with Purifi modules:And here is the back panel connectivity:The massive speaker terminals had no trouble handling my heavy speaker wires.The trigger input is unusual in that it is supposed to fully shut of the unit, consuming no power  .  The amps are mounted to the bottom of the case as is typically down.  So the top got slightly warm in testing.  The bottom though was rather toasty after stress testing.  I will post a teardown later.In use, the NC1200DM never complained, shut down, or go into protection.  Even during my intensive power versus frequency that causes weaker designs to bail out, the NC1200DM cruised right on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard at 5 watts into 4 Ohms:Channel matching is quite good.Highest distortion is third harmonic at around -108 dB which mostly responsible for 105 dB of SINAD  .  This puts the NC1200DM near the top of our rankings:Signal to noise ratio was quite good especially near max power:32-tone signal resembling \"music\" shows exceptionally low intermodulation distortion in audible band:Most meaningful test is power versus distortion and noise so let\\'s get into that with 4 ohm load:We clock nearly 500 watts before the clipping onset.  Hypex rates the module at 700 watts which is likely at higher distortion levels  .  Distortion rises fairly early relative to our reference.I was surprised to once again see how quiet the NC1200DM was when testing at 8 ohms and comparing to Purifi 1ET400A reference design:Power output leaves 1ET400A behind at 270+ watts.  The cost is higher distortion.Keeping THD+N at 0.1% and sweeping the frequency we get:Now we peak at 600 watts.  Drop at low frequencies where we need power is slight  .  The sudden drop at 20 kHz is usually due to ultrasonic noise shaping and wide bandwidth of this test  .  In real use, we don\\'t need much power at 20 kHz and at any rate, a lot more would be produced than this chart indicates.Here is the intermodulation distortion for 19+20 kHz tones for those of you who love this graph: Remember that the threshold of hearing is quite high at 19 and 20 khz even for people with healthy response up to these levels.  And at any rate, music never has full amplitude signals at these levels.Crosstalk performance was very good, stopping just short of our reference:ConclusionsThe Nord One NC1200M Signature Edition produces tons and tons of clean power with very low noise floor.  While other amps have tested with lower distortion, none come to its power output.  Audiophiles routinely underestimate how much power they need.  As such, it is great to see an amplifier produce so much power while keeping distortion and noise at bay.  I see no performance flaws anywhere.Yes, the \"signature\" components are of dubious value but they are not hurting things either.The enclosure is attractive.  And the whole package light and efficient.  My kind of design. I am happy to give a strong recommendation to the Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amp. -As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.The panther without the head took my car for a joy ride.

       " \" VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp  .      costs US $2,090.  I just reviewed the same amp but with SIL 994EnH-Ticha Pro buffer so you can compare them. As with the other variation, I am a fan of the more slim rack mount case  :Back panel as expected:VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp MeasurementsLet's start with our dashboard and see if the power supply noise we had with the SIL buffer also exists here thereby telling us if the problem was that or something else:Sadly the issue remains with the noise in the FFT spectrum.  So something else is at play.  I tried to mess with grounding to see if it impacts it and it would get much worse.  At one point one channel got unstable producing variable output.  Maybe that was instrumentation error but I did not walk away with a good feeling on this.  Nevertheless, overall ranking remains quite high due to stellar performance of Purifi amplifier module itself:I am just going to post the rest of the measurements without text as they are similar as the other review:When I ran the dashboard and saw the same problems with the other VTV amplifier, I wanted to rule out instrumentation error.  So I dug up my Purifi reference design and it produced superbly clean output as it did in my original review.  While I was at it, I also ran this test   and it produced similar output to this VTV amplifier.  So the choice of buffer doesn't have much impact here:ConclusionsWhen I bought my latest car, it came with a fine scratch on the instrumentation cluster cover.  Too lazy to take it back to be repaired.  To this day it bothers me when I see it even though it doesn't impact anything on the operation of the car.  Such is the case with this VTV Purifi amplifiers.  In absolute terms they land way on top of the class.  But looking carefully we see that something in the assembly and layout has caused performance to degrade objectively.  It won't impact you in any way listening to it but just like my car, it shouldn't be there.  Smaller companies building these boxes don't do any measurements and hence can't spot problems like this.  So it is partly understandable but as consumers, we get to be ruthless in our demand in best in class execution.  So I hope the company looks to resolve these problems as their prices are very attractive otherwise.I can't recommend the VTV Purifi amplifiers based on these two versions I have tested. -\",\n",
       " 'The design of the Vera Audio P150/600 RS is complete. The price is 29 600 NOK exclusive tax and shipping. Due to the corona situation and a delay with chassises, it will be a while before we have a decent number in quantity. We only have a few for sales at the moment and that\\'s the reason it hasn\\'t been announced yet. But I thought I would share some details for those who have an interest.In 4 Ohm it delivers 1kW with amazingly low 0.0006% THD+N. This is bridged, but it says a lot about the performance. The \"notches\" you see in the graph below comes from our measuring equipment switching measuring area and isn\\'t able to keep up with such low numbers. The actual distortion around 50-500W is even lower. Probably down towards 0.00025%.In stereo mode it gives out 290W in 4 Ohm with the same low distortion:The linearity is also in it\\'s own class. +/- 0.025dB from 20Hz to 20kHz. -3dB at 60kHz.The noise as low as 17uV  :CMRR.This is something we have spent a lot of resources on. Briefly said, CMRR is the the amplifiers ability to supress noise that comes from the outside through cables. Everything over 100dB is considered expectionally good.Here\\'s the measurement of the gain adjustments. This is also something we have spent a lot of time on to get accurate.You can see that the maximum deviation is 0.01dBThe chassis of the amplifier is cut out from a whole block of aluminium and there are no visible screws or seams. It\\'s of very high quality and part of the reason our amplifier cost what it does besides extremely accurate gain adjustments, bridging option, etc.Some more info from our enigneer Armand:* We use a huge power supply of 3kW. This has plenty more capacity and runs cooler at heavy loads. It will also result in much lower distortion at low frequencies  * Our amplifier is   the only Purifi model that has bridging capability. A lot of testing has been done and special considerations are in place to make this work as it should. Looking at the measurements of 1kW with 0,0006% distortion proves this is flawless.* We deliver real measurements of the whole amplifier from input to output measured with a R&S Audio analyzer.   The noise, THD+N and power delivery presented by others on specification sheets are in several cases only copied from the Purifi 1ET400A datasheet and do not tell the whole story. Internal layout, audio buffer, power supply, cooling capacity all play a role into the final result.* We use a microcontroller that constantly monitors the 1ET400A modules. Temperatures, voltages, overcurrent, clipping, error modes, etc. The RGB LED on the front will warn the user if the amplifier operates outside safe limits. Clipping is warned with RED/GREEN blinks depending on Left/Right channel. Sustained overcurrent will shut down the amplifier in order to avoid damage to speakers and warn the user with steady RED light. A yellow light will warn the user that the temperature is reaching a level that is not healthy.* We have a Auto OFF function. 3 hours without signal on the inputs will initiate a shutdown of the amplifier to conserve power and longevity of the product .  * There is a trigger input.  * All small signal levels are contained inside a well shielded small compartment in the back, ensuring low noise and excellent RF protection. The RF protection is done directly at the back of the fully shielded Neutrik XLR inputs. The XLR inputs are directly connected to the chassis to ensure short signal patc to ground.* Remote sensing of the amplifier feedback loop at the speaker terminals using a four wire system ensures the lowest possible output impedance and distortion at the terminals.Here is a picture of the internal layout.

       " ' Neurochrome Modulus-286 Power   amplifier Kit.    company designer and member, @tomchr.  It is to ship by end of this month and costs $1,299.  See:  you may recall from my review of Tom\\'s headphone amplifier, Neurochrome designs strive for very low distortion and good, objective performance.  So I have been quite excited and anxious to measure one of Tom\\'s power amplifiers.From the outside, the Modulus-286 is rather small but very chunky look with massive heatsinks   on each side of the unit:The heart of Modulus-286 and other solid state amplifiers Tom designs are the integrated LM3886 IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect this is from the National Semiconductor team though which was acquired by TI.The LM3886 is a pretty powerful little IC capable of producing about 70 watts at 4 ohm.  The Modulus-286 uses a pair of them to get over 100 watts of power at the same rating for each channel.  Typical of mass market amplifier ICs though, the distortion rating is nothing to write home about at 0.02%  .  In Tom\\'s design, an active feedback loop   brings this distortion way down as you will see in the measurements.The LM3886 is a class AB amplifier unlike other products we have tested that use much more efficient class D.  So while the LM3886 by itself is small, it requires pretty large heatsinks to cool it which is the reason for them being included in Modulus-286.  But in addition to the amplifier circuit, another source of size, weight and some heat is the power supply.  Here, Modulus-286 deviates from classic class AB designs by using a switching power supply to gain its size and weight advantage.  You can see it in the center of the Modulus-286:It is a commercial switching supply which Tom says has been customized for his use.The amplifier modules are actually hard to see on each side of the central power supply.  I tried to take a picture of them but it was hard:You can see the two LM3886 ICs mounted to the heatsink at the bottom.  I am sure there are better pictures at Tom\\'s website.So let\\'s get into the measurements and see how she does.MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my dashboard view with 5 watts of output and in this case, XLR balanced inputs:SINAD   breaks the 100 dB barrier which is nice.  You can see that the distortion of 0.0009% is orders of magnitude better than the specified level by TI  .I noticed a lot more mains/power supply noise in one channel than the other.  Nothing I did would impact its level.  I could also feel the \"tingling\" sensation from the case which indicates mains leakage.  This is legal and safe   but does explain the elevated levels there.  Of course at -110 dB is not audible since our hearing is so poor in low frequencies.Next,   all important power versus distortion+noise:Compared to our best measured so far, Hypex NC400, the Modulus-286 nearly matches it in noise level.  On distortion, one channel also tracks the NC400 until its max power of 95 watts.  This was with 0.975 millivolts of input.  Attempting to feed it strong signal would cause it to go into protection so I could not quite get to the specified power rating.One channel deviates some though as you see in light red.  the better channel goes as low at 0.0007% of THD+N or SINAD of 103.  Seeing how this is at max power, it is very nice  ure to arrive at.  Performance is basically noise dominated with no distortion until the shut down.The Hypex DIY NC400 has more power but its distortion starts to rise from where Modulus-286 stops.  It produces 226 watts at the point I have marked in blue.  So it has more headroom.Frequency response shows somewhat early roll off:We are down 0.4 dB at 20 kHz.  Would have been nice to see this flatter seeing how this is a traditional class AB design.  Likely it is part of the computation to keep the amplifier stable with different loads.  Of course not an audible concern for most of us who can\\'t even hear 20 kHz let alone 0.4 dB of drop in there.  Signal to noise ratio is quite good:Broadband spectrum analysis to 1 MHz shows very little of concern:We see some indication of the switching frequency of the power supply around 160 kHz but its level is quite low at nearly -100 dB.  With class D amplifiers we see levels as high as -30 dB!  Note that since this is a class AB amplifier, I did NOT use my AES-17 filter with any of the tests.I tested THD+N versus frequency at 6 different power levels as you see on the graph:As expected, distortion rises at higher frequencies  .  At 97 watts, the Modulus-286 could produce frequencies above 1 kHz but below that, it would enter into protection mode as indicated by vertical lines in orange.At the lowest power level   we are dominated by noise and hence the elevated line in red for that.  That is true of any power amplifier.Finally here is the crosstalk for one channel  :Please take this as worst case response.  I am testing the amp using a bunch of wires everywhere which can impact crosstalk  .  I need to build a dedicated module with tight wiring for tests like this.  Regardless, numbers like this are amply good enough as far as audibility is concerned.ConclusionsThe Neurochrome delivers good power with very low distortion using a combination of active feedback and off-the-shelf amplifier IC.  Use of a switching power supply keeps costs, size and weight down.  It produces nearly 100 watts of very clean power into 4 ohm load.  Personally I like to have much more power than that.    But if you have subwoofers, or don\\'t listen as loud and/or have more efficient loudspeakers, you should be fine.I am not sure what value judgement to put on the amplifier.  Certainly at $1,300, the Modulus-286 amplifier is \"cheap\" compared to any high-end amplification.  At the other externe, the DIY Hypex NC400 I tested produced more power at I think $1,500.  Purchasing the Neurochrome Modulus-286 would let you support a smart, Canadian designer and entrepreneur.  I let you decide how valuable that is.Overall, I can recommend the Neurochrome Modulus-286 as a well-engineered product with no design faults. -',\n",
       " ' NAD M27 7-channel surround audio amplifier. Seems like the M27 came out back in 2014 and costs US $4,400.The M27 has the same design language as the excellent M17 Home Theater Processor  :The enclosure, especially the top surfaces, oozes quality and luxury in the way that many high-end audio companies fail at.  And the looks are actually functional with ample ventilation holes for proper cooling.  I will do a teardown later to show this in more detail.One strange bit of functionality is that the NAD logo lights up orange but goes off when the amplifier is turned on using the touch button on top.  This is backwards but fits the functionality for home theater use in darkened room.The rear panel takes the high quality look of the front and top to the back:Everything from XLR connectors to speaker terminals is stout and feels solid.In use, the amplifier when driven in two channel mode, never came remotely close to complaining, shutting down, etc. which I frequently see in AVRs.Heat dissipation at first is very modest but after half hour of use, the idle power consumption of the rest of the unused channels served to warm up the top.  No worries though as it was not remotely \"hot.\"  This is due to use of switching power supply   and class D amplifiers based on design from Hypex nCore series.  The actual implementation is custom which I will show in teardown.For my testing, I focused on XLR input only.  I hope if you buy an amplifier of this class, that is the connection you use.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard, driving two channels into 4 ohm at 5 watts:Ah, what a relief it is to see excellent SINAD   in home theater space after testing so many subpar amplifiers in AVRs.  Distortion products are around -110 dB.  Ironically, this is far better than the processor and AVR DACs we have tested.  In 2-channel world, our desktop class are usually way ahead of amplifiers but not in home theater.  So far anyway.The very nice showing in noise and distortion puts the M27 amplifier near top of the class:Spectrum of 1 kHz FFT shows the typical switching frequency in 400+ kHz:Here is the frequency response:There is a kink in there around 50 kHz but seeing how it is way out there as far as audiblity, it should be OK.  May differ though with a real speaker load.Crosstalk is very good:Dynamic range at around rated power is excellent  :Even at rated power you have 105 dB or 17.5 bits.Most important test is THD+N   relative to power level as we increase input.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Wow, this is one powerful beast in stereo mode.  Courtesy of a power supply that is designed to feed 7 channels, it is not a bottleneck in 2-channel mode allowing these class d modules to sing.  And sing loud!8 Ohm output is also quite good:Of course in neither case we are able to match the state-of-the-art 2-channel amplifiers from likes of Benchmark or Purifi.  But what is there at -90 dB or better should be quite excellent.Peak power as you can imagine, is even higher:Here is a refined version of a recent test: I sweep for power using different frequencies from 20 kHz on down to just 20 Hz.  Test bandwidth is 45 kHz so that it allows enough harmonics to be included in the test but not too much that it just shows ultrasonic noise-shaping and such:As expected, at low frequencies we have lowest distortion   but we clip due to much larger power demand of these \"slow\" waves.ConclusionsThe NAD M27 surround power amplifier has exceptional looks and build quality.  It is beautiful to look at.  That beauty runs way deep into its veins, producing lots of power in a class-leading way.  Efficiency of class-d power amplifier and switching power supplies serve to keep the unit quite cool for its power rating and number of channels.  Great attention has gone into heat management and signal flow -- something I don\\'t normally see in DIY hypex ncore builds.Yes, at US $4,400 it is not cheap but you are getting 7 channels of amplifications.  That is roughly $630/channel which is actually quite competitive.I am happy to give the NAD M27 one of my highest recommendations.If you have a home theater and want a gorgeous, powerful and performant multi-channel amplifier, your search is over.  Get the M27 and worry about money for food later. -',\n",
       " \"  March Audio P122 class D Hypex based stereo power amplifier.     .  The P122 costs US $750. Due to my relationship with company owner, I won't be performing a review or providing a recommendation one way or the other.  So don't look for panthers on pictures either.The P122 uses similar packaging to the rest of March Audio products:There is just a touch button that turns the unit on and off  .The back panel has very nice and really long speaker terminals:In use, the P122 never complained or get warm.  It passed all the tests without going into protection mode.Power supply is switching as noted on the unit so works as is worldwide.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:As noted on the THD+N panel, performance is roughly the same as the spec in one channel and slightly better in the other.  Distortion and noise combined is near top of class:Signal to noise ratio is excellent:Crosstalk is respectable as well:Frequency response is good but not flat out to infinity as some amps are:Multitone test shows a few odd spikes in mid frequencies:But levels are nearly 100 dB down so not a cause for concern.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet's start with 4 ohm:We are a bit shy of the specification on power but distortion and noise is much better than typical mass market product.  Same is true of 8 ohm load:Not sure what explains the shortfall in power. These amplifiers have regulated switching power supplies so usually don't produce more power than continuous:ConclusionsWhile the power level is on the low side, the performance is much better than typical brand name amplifiers. -\",\n",
       " ' ATI AT522NC Stereo power amplifier. The 522NC costs US $2,195 but I see it on Amazon for US $1,995.  The AT522NC is part of a series which starts with 2 channels of class D amplification and goes up to 4 channels in the same enclosure.The industrial design of the AT522NC has some unique touches, some of which work, some that don\\'t:The part that detracts is ironically the ATI logo.The power button has a very nice feel and gives one impression of quality.Looking at the back, I was surprised by choice of input power connection:It is a 20 amp IEC connection rather than the most common, 15 amp variety.  This is partially due to use of linear power supply and massive/heavy toroidal transformer.  But the most common reason is that the same setup is used in higher channel count amplification.The amplifier is on a vertically mounted hypex NC-500 class D amplifiers with their own heatsinks.  The \"motherboard\" has the power supply components.  Overall, it seems like a very neat and logical design.The speaker connections are of course very secure and high quality as can be expected in this price range.  Great to see balanced XLR inputs which is how   unit.In use, there was barely a heat rise in the enclosure and the unit never shut down or complain even in the face of severe clipping.   The large feet allow better convection cooling which is appreciated.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone, at 5 watt into a 4 ohm load:The use of linear power supply has its price in the form of power supply spurious tones  .  The dominant distortion peak is third harmonic at a bit less than 100 dB.  Add some noise to it and SINAD   becomes around 98 dB.  This places the ATI522NC well above average of all the amplifiers we have tested:It sits just to the level of NC500 from Nord.  Those of you who keep track of such things , I am sure will compare and contrast how it does relative to other Hypex based implementations.Signal to noise ratio is good reaching excellence at full power:Frequency response is orderly for a class D amplifier which needs an output filter to truncate switching frequency:32-tone source trying to simulate \"music\" shows very low levels of intermodulation distortion:But for a peak at 60 Hz  , the distortion-free range is 110 dB or about 18 bits.Crosstalk is also very good:Most important data is power into 4 and 8 ohm versus distortion and noise.  So let\\'s start with 4 ohm:So not class leading but low distortion while providing 300 or so watts before sudden rise in distortion.  Spec is higher but one can have more data points at the limit and gradually walk up the curve, and hence squeeze out a few more watts.  I will show this later.For 4 ohm load, here is the comparison to our state-of-the-art in class D amplification in the form of Purifi reference design:Purifi maintains the lead in distortion but produces a bit less power.I was able to run my tough test of THD+N at 0.1% versus frequencies.  Some amplifiers have died trying to run this test.  Others are had to poinpoint as their distortion jumps all over the place:We see that at 1 kHz we normally measure, power is almost near max.  Above that we reach nearly 360 watts.  At 20 kHz though, distortion shoots way up and we are able to only produce 22 watts before THD+N of 0.1% is hit.  Fortunately there is not much music energy there so practical audible concern is low.I made a survey of a few of the tracks in my music library.  Peak energy seems to hover around 40 Hz.  For that reason, I have started to measure amount of power at 40 Hz and here, we have 316 watts which is good.Finishing off, switching frequency is around 400 kHz:The noise doesn\\'t scale with power though.  Plotting the same at max power with source frequency of 40 Hz gives us this:And intermodulation distortion using 19+20 kHz at 5 watts output into 4 ohm:ConclusionsThe ATI AT522NC seems like a solidly built amplifier based on Hypex NC500 modules.  ATI builds amplifiers for many other companies and this competence shows up in this review.  Performance is of course limited by what the NC500 module can do.  Use of linear power supply defeats the size and weight advantages of common class D amplifiers.  It may provide better peak power rating -- something I wanted to test but forgot.  Overall, I can recommend the ATI AT522NC stereo amplifier. -As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.Watching important news on TV as I type this so no positive energy to think of a lame joke.

       " ' NAD M28 Multichannel amplifier based on Purifi Eigentakt technology.  It was kindly purchased by a member from a local dealer   and sent to me for testing.  The M28 costs US $4999 through its dealers.As with the M27 amplifier I reviewed, the M28 comes in the same gorgeous industrial design:At nearly 50 pounds, this is a heavy amplifier likely due to the weight of the enclosure as the class D amplifiers and it switching power supply are light.The one thing I am not a fan of is the touch on/off button on top.  It is not responsive.  I wish the NAD logo was a hard switch.The back panel shows how you do a first class job of termination:I have kind permission from the owner for a teardown so look for that soon.EDIT: Tear down is now here:  MeasurementsThe Purifi 1ET400A that the NAD is based on scored a SINAD   of 104 dB.  Let\\'s see we get that from M28:Oh no!!!  Distortion has risen by 15 dB but thankfully it is below threshold of audibility.  Noise however, has degraded fair bit, sinking SINAD by the tune of 6 dB.  There is also good bit of variability with the SINAD measurement constantly changing 1 dB or more.  As it is, the M28 slips in performance even relative to last year\\'s M27:For a clue of what may have happened we can look at the amplifier gain which is now at 29 dB versus reference design\\'s 27 dB.  Given the anemic output of AV products from their pre-outs, I can see why NAD opted to do this but whatever the reason, noise performance has suffered.  We can clearly see this in signal to noise ratio:As noted, we have dropped 5 dB in noise performance which more or less explains the similar drop in SINAD.  This is a shame as noise can be audible unlike low levels of distortion.  Fortunately we still clear my hurdle of 96 dB for 16 bit content even at 5 watts so practical consequence will be small.Before someone asks, here is the dashboard with RCA:Thankfully performance is similar.Frequency response is good and matches the reference design:Crosstalk performance was superb:You buy a power amplifier for \"wattage\" so let\\'s see how the M28 performs into 4 ohm load:Gosh, not only do we have higher noise level but also much higher   distortion as power output increases relative to reference design.  I did not want to believe this so to confirm my setup, I pulled the reference design and measured it again and its performance was unchanged  .  So this is definitely a degradation in M28 design.We can see similar issue with IMD intermodulation test:Fortunately as noted, we do get more power than the reference design which was likely limited by its power supply.Letting distortion climb up to 1% produces more power naturally:Interesting to see that burst power is actually a bit lower!  The test attempts to change output power until it achieves 1% THD+N and it must have reached that at that lower power.  I wonder if the sudden burst on the input increases distortion a bit.  It is an engineering curiosity than anything else.Switching to 8 ohm load we get:We again have lower performance compared to reference but the gap is lower.With AVRs, we see power reducing as we increase the number of channels.  Not here:This is excellent and shows the value of high efficiency amplification and power supply.Sweeping at different frequencies shows some small oddities but nothing of major concern:Note that our normal testing for power per industry standard uses 1 kHz but the most need is at lower frequencies.  For that reason, I have started to annotate power at 20 Hz as seen above.  All amplifiers I have tested reduce their power at low frequencies.EDIT: per request here is multitone test:ConclusionsWithout context, the NAD M28 would get very high praise from me.  Alas, taking a reference design and reducing its performance is not going to put me in that mood.  This is the cost of manufacturers not providing detailed specifications/measurements like I am providing.  If they had done that, their marketing department would immediately see that they have taken a step back and push engineering to do better. In absence of that, the \"Eigentakt\" label is plastered in the marketing material and celebration begins.What NAD has done is taken a superior amplifier design and brought its performance below that of older Hypex technology.  And charge $600 more for the privilege.  Not right.On the glass half full side of the argument, this is a beautiful amplifier, superbly crafted with excellent performance and tons of power.  I looked and could not find any M27 for sale anyway so M28 it is.I am going to of course put the M28 on my recommended list.  Just no celebration.  NAD, you could have done better. -',\n",
       " ' Buckeye Hypex NC502MP 8-channel class D amplifier.   costs US $2,295.There is not a whole lot to look at here.  Sheet metal is rather thin and fitment not that great.  So put it in a cabinet and forget about it.  The backside shows the expected including trigger control to sequence powering up multiple units with one stroke:I was surprised by the weight of the amplifier. Mind you, it is far lighter than a class AB amplifier but it is still not light.  The reason for that is that each amplifier module has a large vertical heatsink with quite stout mounting bracket tying it to the chassis.If you are not familiar with Hypex NC502MP, it is an all-in-one high power stereo amplifier with on-board switching power supply and input buffer.  Supply the connectors and you have a complete amplifier.  In this case, four such modules are included to get to 8 channel.  Due to large amount of power these amplifiers can produce in tandem, dual AC inputs are provided.  The amplifiers are split between the two AC inputs.  If you don\\'t need continuous power, you can connect both inputs to the same power strip which is how I tested it.Buckeye Hypex NC502MP Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard by measuring one amplifier module\\'s dual outputs:Performance is very good as we expect from Hypex modules.  A minor issue was the power supply spikes in one channel  . I tested all the amplifier modules and they all do the same thing.  So likely is due to leakage from the onboard power supply bleeding into the more adjacent channel on NC502MP.  Using the \"good\" channel on each board removes that bit of bleeding:Using the former SINAD for ranking, the amplifier nicely lands in our \"excellent\" bucket:Here is all of them in that category:Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and changing the load has no impact on output:Multitone shows the superb performance, albeit somewhat worsened by the less good channel:Noise performance is extremely good:My target is 96 dB at 5 watts which the Buckeye nicely exceeds.  And provides full transparency up to reference level of 120 dBSPL.Crosstalk naturally is beyond approach if you use two separate modules but even in the same module, it is excellent:Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm using channels in the same module or two separate ones:As you see, there is no difference.  You are only limited by how much AC power you have as power supplies are not shared.Max and peak power is impressive:We are talking nearly 1.3 Kilowatts in stereo!  Needless to say, if you are going to have all 8 channels whaling, you better have good amount of current on dual AC lines.  And make an appointment at your ear, nose and throat doctor because hearing damage is most likely!Measuring response at 8 ohm gave me a really hard time:Reason being that online specs from Hypex does not show that hump from 10 to 100 watts at all.  I tried everything from testing my instrumentation to measuring every amplifier module and still got the same results.  I shared the graph with Buckeye only to be told there is updated measurements from Hypex showing the same hump.    While performance is superb up to about 8 watts, I wish that the hump wasn\\'t so pronounced.I was most impressed by the ability of these modules to drive down to 2 ohms with both capacitive and inductive loads:It produces the same 53 volts no matter what!  At 1 ohm though, it instantly went into protection but recovered very quickly.This is one powerful and robust amplifier!Finally, you don\\'t really need to warm it up:FYI, I left the unit on overnight and in the morning, the top was warm especially in the center.  All the amps combined, do generate some amount of heat so best to not leave it on if you don\\'t need it and provide good ventilation.ConclusionsThe Buckeye NC502MP is a perfect amplifier for home theater duty. It provides incredible amount of power from each module to drive even the most inefficient speakers to ear piercing levels.  It does so with extremely low noise and excellent distortion at modest levels.  At higher powers, distortion does climb.  While I wish this was lower, I don\\'t think there is an issue at all for home theater applications.  Even with music, I think you will be fine but the purist may want to have better.  Then again, if you are going to lose power to get there, this amplifier may be a better choice.I am going to put the Buckeye NC502MP 8-channel amplifier on my recommended list.EDIT: teardown now posted:  always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   ',\n",
       " \" Buckeye Hypex NC502MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased and drop shipped to me by our dear moderator, @AdamG247.  I don't know what it costs.Not sure what there is to say about the case:Or the back panel:Other than the fact that it has trigger switch and that the XLR connectors are upside down.  You need to use two hands to unlock and then pull out the cable.  And heaven help you if you don't know there is a locking tab underneath and you keep trying to yank out the cable anyway! In use, the amplifier is very robust, going into and out of protection with no shut downs  .  Note however that once it starts to clip, there is a high pitch whine from the power supply inductors.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started my testing with the amplifier module all the way to the left in the picture above  .  Here is our warm up graph:Was glad to see the unit stabilize in a couple of minutes so I did not have to wait forever.  Once there, here is our dashboard:I don't know what is going on with the channel in blue producing a lot more power supply noise  .  Grounding made no difference.  As a result, one channel is 3 dB better than the other.  Averaging the two still lands the amp into our upper tier of all amplifiers tested to date:Despite the power supply issue above, signal to noise ratio is excellent and superb if driven to max power:Frequency response shows no sign of load dependency which can be common in class D amplifiers:Multitone test gets polluted by the aforementioned power supply interference:Crosstalk was not as good as I expected although in grand scheme of things, it is not bad:Let's see how much power this thing can pump out starting with 4 ohm load:We have more distortion than I like but that comes with a ton more power than our more accurate but less powerful amplifiers.  Allow 1% distortion and we get even more:Very impressive considering that you have 6 channels in this lightweight enclosure!As noted, power did not increase when I split the measurement between two independent modules at each end of the case. This indicates we are amplifier limited, not power supply  .Switch to 8 ohm we get better noise and distortion although the main issue is still there:Multichannel PerformanceI thought I was all set for measuring more than 2 channels only to find out the balanced cables I had bought had the wrong gender.    So all I could do was drive 3 channels at once:What you see is the same stereo pair measured with and without the extra channel also being driven  .  There is no impact at all which makes sense as these are independent modules and nothing but the power cord is shared between them.Looking for consistency between the modules, I measured each one separately:ConclusionsWhile still way ahead of countless amplifier designs, the Hypex NC502MP modules are built more for power than ultra low distortion.  Not a bad compromise considering the fact that running out of power is quite audible and rise in distortion probably not.  Beauty of class D amplification is showcased by Buckeye in producing six times 600 watts of amplification in a light, and compact case.  I will do a teardown later but so far, I am happy with what is there, sans the upside down XLR connectors.EDIT: Teardown posted:  always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   \",\n",

I believe the heart of the unit is Hypex NC122MP.boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2 MeasurementsThe unit stabilized quickly with its performance hardly changing  :Here is our dashboard:This level of distortion and noise   nicely landed the amp into our \"excellent\" category:Signal to noise ratio was excellent, achieving better than CD dynamic range at just 5 watts of output:Typical of Hypex amplifiers   is lack of load impedance dependency which plagues many budget class D amplifiers:The 2408/N2 achieved one of the lowest crosstalk I have measured:Multitone results are very good as well:Let\\'s see how much power we have:Not a ton but it is above average as far as noise and distortion.  Allowing a bit more distortion we get:Which is right on the money as far as company specifications.  Here is 8 ohm performance:Checking for frequency dependence we see well behaved response:But note the loss of power with 20 Hz input.Finally, here is the switching and ultrasonic performance:I checked the unit for temperature after all the test and could barely feel any rise above room temp on any of the surfaces.ConclusionsThe Arthur 2408 comes in an attractive and differentiated package with very high quality connectivity.  Measured performance is hugely above average although not state of the art.  I could not find any weakness in its performance no matter which way I measured it -- a sign of excellent engineering.  The cost is up there though for the level of power you get.  Seeing how company is represented here  , support should be easy as well.I am happy to recommend the boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2.

I con ured it using their online tool and it shows a cost of US $1,868.Not much to see or talk about as far as the case other than dual fans on top:Thankfully they did not come on during my testing but it is good insurance to have given the total power this unit can generate.The rear panel shows the usual balanced inputs although in this case it is 1/4 inch/XLR combo jacks:For my testing, I focused on channels 1 and 2.  Did plan to test the rest of the channels for total power but forgot that I had no way of generating that many balanced outputs so what you are about to see is for stereo only.  Seeing how the amp modules are stereo anyway, this should be representative of what you get even if turned on the rest of them at full power.KJF MA-01 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:We expect excellent performance from Hypex and we get it there, producing well above average SINAD which represents level of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is very high indicating a very quiet amplifier:32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" shows very low distortion as well:Frequency response is essentially flat with almost no dependency on whether I used 4 or 8 ohm test load:This means the frequency response should not change much when you switch one speaker for another  .Crosstalk is very good:The meat of an amplifier review is the amount of power versus distortion+noise so let\\'s start with 4 ohm:Spec is 250 watts which is what we get if we allow more distortion than I do in the above graph:Seems that the power supply is designed to power the amp exactly as specified and no more and hence the lack of increase on bursts  .Switching to 8 ohm we get:I like the lower noise with 8 ohm better than 4 ohm.Finally, there is a bit too much disturbance when we change frequency and sweep for power than I like:But as noted on the graph, there are far worse examples.ConclusionsThe hypex NC252MP stereo amplifier modules do their job to product above average performance while running cool and efficient.  While I have not yet looked inside the KJF amp, from the outside it seems like they have not done anything to lower the performance of these nice modules.I am going to put the KJF MA-01 with Hypex NC252MP on my recommended list.Edit: see teardown here:  always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   ',\n",

       " ' JL Electronic\\'s   Sylph-D200 stereo amplifier module built on top of TI\\'s TPA3255 amplifier IC.  Depending on the con uration you pick, the module costs US $130 to $170.  You can read more about it here:   Or ask questions from the company representative @jlesterp.Testing bare modules is difficult for me so I asked for a finished system and that is what I received:Not much to see here so let\\'s look at the module inside:I must say that row of inductors looks pretty lined up that way.    I should note that the company is an ODM   for other companies and is located in Philippines.  They provided their own measurements that correlate well with mine.There are two power supply con urations.  The version I have is the lower voltage one   that produces lower power than than if you choose to power it with 45 volt rails.JLE Sylph-D200 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:The gain is rather low compared to 29 dB that I usually see in amplifiers.  Then again this allows full power at the levels that our desktop DACs produce so it is fine.  I understand the base gain in the TI chip is lower still.  A buffer opamp is used to get up to 14 dB.  The lower gain gives an advantage to this board when it comes to other amplifiers which have more noise due to higher gain.  Still, let\\'s do our usual SINAD comparison:The board is just 0.1 dB short of falling in our superb category in blue!  I am told that there is a bit of SINAD loss at the speaker terminals as opposed to the board itself. If so, this is a remarkable achievement.Noise performance is excellent but again, keep in mind the lower gain:At 5 watts, it easily clears my 16-bit/96 dB hurdle.  This shows that we can build more optimized systems if we take full advantage of the output of our DACs with amplifiers that have lower gain.  The board can be con ured with the feedback including the output filter or not.  The con uration I have has it including the filter which reduces load dependency but does not eliminate it:Multitone test shows the classic rise of distortion with frequency:Crosstalk performance was very good:Power sweep into 4 ohm load shows very low and interestingly, constant distortion ratio until hard clipping:Company thinks the input buffer is overloading.  As noted, to get more power you need to step up to higher voltage power supply.The hard clipping made it hard for AP software to properly determine the 1%THD point but did show the burst power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Testing for frequency sensitivity we see that behavior is decent:ConclusionsIt is amazing to see the progress these \"chip amps\" are making in the hands of capable designers.  They are inching their way to the top of the class in our distortion and noise rankings while keeping costs very low.  In the case of JLE, it is nice to see a design from another part of the world making it easier to access DIY oriented hobbyists to access them who are locally situated.  Interacting with member @jlesterp has been a delight as well.I am happy to recommend the JLE Sylph-D200 amplifier module. ---As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   ',\n",
       " '  March Audio P502 class D amplifier based on Hypex   modules.  It was kindly send to me by a member for testing.  The P502 costs US $1,075 from the company direct.This is not a review because the @March Audio is a long time member of the forum and I like to avoid conflict of interest.The unit comes in attractive aluminum packaging:On off control is a touch button which is unusual in power amplifiers.Here is a shot of the back:In hard use, the bottom plate gets quite warm.  Make sure you have plenty of ventilation from below.  A taller set of feet would help with this.My heavy stress test of frequency versus power caused the unit to shut down momentarily.  I did not retry it as I don\\'t want to risk damaging the unit.Warm Up TestAs is my standard practice now, I warm up and measure distortion and noise until the device stabilizes.  For amps, I do this at 5 watts.  Here are the results:As you see the channel in red is having a harder time, showing fair bit worse performance than the other.  It did improve momentarily after power up but then went back to the same state.  I checked all of my cabling and it was all secure.  So don\\'t know if this is an assembly issue or sample to sample variation.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Per warm up test, we see one channel with higher noise floor and differing distortion products.  Averaging the two channels still puts the P502 well above average amplifier:Frequency response was essentially flat in audible band with a resistive dummy load or my speaker simulator:Crosstalk was good enough and predictable:32-tone test simulating \"music\" shows that 1 kHz is actually the point of higher distortion.  Below and above performance improves:Signal to noise ratio is quite good:Except for the one channel lagging behind.  We are talking about 16+ bits at 5 watts reaching up to nearly 20 bits at full power.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet\\'s start with 4 ohm load:That is a ton of power with very low distortion.  Letting the distortion go up to 1% gets us even more:Switching to 8 ohm load we get:ConclusionsLots and lots of power in above average performance and small package.  If you are going to drive a sub with it at full power, you may want to deploy more cooling/ventilation on the bottom. -',\n",
       " ' IOM NCore Pro, Hypex NC252MP class-d based stereo power amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by   drop shipped to me.  It costs €669 from the company website.The IOM Ncore Pro comes in very compact and solid enclosure:The on/off button feels very good but I find the fonts very cheesy.  That same theme continues in the back:I could not even read those fonts on the gain toggle switch until I took the above picture! Great to see XLR balanced inputs in addition to RCA.  Note the unusual, horizontal placement of the left and right speaker terminals.  I am used to them being stacked vertically when they are so close to each other.In use the top of the amp barely increased in temperature.  The bottom was a bit more warm but nothing remotely of any concern.  There were no shutdowns.  However, I did not try to stress load it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt into 4 ohm test.  I chose the XLR input and low   gain for all of these tests:The SINAD   of 94 dB places the OMI Ncore Pro in the upper tier of amplifiers/AVRs tested:Which was a relief after testing a number of home theater amplifiers that stacked on the right of the graph.Frequency response is dead flat but not super wide:Signal to noise ratio at max power output before clipping into 4 ohm was quite respectable:Here is the intermodulation distortion at very high frequencies  :You have well over 16 bits of distortion free at modest listening levels.  Keep in mind that your music never has such high amplitudes at these frequencies.  So in practice, the distortion will vanish into noise.Crosstalk performance was excellent:The meat of any amplifier review is power versus distortion and noise.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Shame to see the early rise in distortion starting at 20 watts.  That aside, you have considerable amount of power clocking at 236 watts, both channels driven in this tiny enclosure.Switching to 8 ohm load we get:Now the early rise in distortion is more modest.  We get 125 watts of power at a SINAD of 91 db.  Interesting to compare it to Purifi 1E400A which produces similar power but a whopping 130 dB SINAD or 40 dB better!Peak power is sadly not much more than steady state due likely to regulated power supplies:Good thing the baseline level of power is quite good.ConclusionsThe IOM NCore Pro amp is a solid performer courtesy of competent hypex NC252MP class D amplifier modules.  The packaging is nice and tidy and the price seems reasonable to me.No, you are not getting state of the art performance.  That is in another category altogether.  But that level of performance will cost you more money and comes in a larger package.Overall I am happy to recommend the IOM NCore Pro amplifier.  -',\n",
       " \" Buckeye Hypex NC252MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It costs US $1149 as of this writing.  The owner/builder is @Buckeye Amps on our forum.The looks are fine for a well-priced build:The unit is quite light courtesy of rather thin sheet metal.  I am not as worried about the top being thin but the bottom is as well and that is where heat is generated.  You won't likely push all three modules to max but if you did, I would put taller feet under it and maybe even some temperature controlled fans.  In my testing the bottom just got a bit warm so not a major concern.Back panel shows standard connectors plus the trigger input:I stopped using my Mogami Gold XLR cables because I wanted to have colored ones.  I bought a batch from Amazon that is nice and flexible cabling but some kind of generic XLR connectors.  I have found them to be a hair worse than my Mogami cables as far as fit.  On the Buckeye amp though, I could barely get them into the XLR connectors and then back out.  I tried other XLR cables and my other generic ones were also stiff.  The Mogami cable however, was a bit tight but nothing as bad as my generic ones.  I know tolerances very but I had not seen this level of compatibility before with any other gear I have tested.  Anyway, it is a one-shot deal so not a big deal even if the problem exists.Buckeye NC252MP MeasurementsInternally we have three stereo amplifier modules.  So I decided to drive the unit in stereo using first and last channels.  This way we have some variation in modules and their placements.  Here are the results:Hypex spec is 0.002% which we are meeting here.  I could not  ure out why the one channel had so much more mains noise  .  I tried every kind of grounding but it made no difference at all.  SINAD though is dominated by the second harmonic so that noise is not so material in that regard:So quite competent and better than any mass market AVR amplifier.Frequency response is pretty good for a class D amplifier:Signal to noise ratio is excellent even with that extra mains hum.  It nicely clears the noise floor of a 16-bit digital format:Crosstalk naturally was superb when measuring two different modules but also good in stereo mode in one module:Fascinating that a DIY amplifier can be so good whereas many premium audio products we test struggle here.Let's get into the meat of the review which is the power into 4 ohm load:The red pair of lines is using the two channels out of one amplifier module.  We see healthy amount of power to the tune of 224 watts each. Strangely when I tried two different modules  , performance dropped some in both channels even though one channel is the same as before!  Maybe the two amps are  hting each other a bit for current.  Or there is some kind of beat frequency between them.  Not a real worry though as far as audibility but interesting nonetheless.Typical of these class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, there is no peak power:Here is our output with 8 ohm load:Testing for frequency dependency, we get good results as we expect from Hypex modules:ConclusionsI don't know the module price for the amps within this unit but getting 6 channels of amplification with such performance is a heck of a deal.  You are benefitting from a DIY person building these for you with no intention of making a living.    I will do a teardown soon and we can see if the internal build is good. I am happy to recommend the Buckeye 6 channel, NC252MP based amplifier.-\",\n",
       " '  of Accuphase E-270 Integrated Amplifier.    our friends at Gig Harbor Audio.  It is their demo unit so I have to return it on Tuesday.  So if you need something else to be measured, ask right away!  The E-270 was released in 2017 I think and retails for USD $5,000.  This is not cheap by our normal standards but in high-end audio, this is a pretty reasonable price.The industrial design of the unit seemingly has not changed from 1980s era with beautiful VU meters  :At 44 pounds, the unit is quite heavy for its capabilities.  There is a massive transformer in the middle of the unit and the power amplifier modules with beefy heatsinks sit on either side.  During my testing, I could not even get the unit to become warm let alone hot!  It runs so comfortably that one thinks it is never going to stress out.The front has a slick finish that is lovely to touch.  Volume control is implemented through resistor ladders and hence has electronic control.  Accuphase says it has 6,500 steps which should be plenty for listening although was a bit difficult to dial in the exact value for measurements.There are slots in the back for optional DAC and phono stage   which mine did not have. All in all this is the type of construction, look and feel that would justify paying good bit of premium over a budget product. Given the likely reliability that comes from a high-end product from Japan, I say the stage is set for a good impression.Note: seeing how this is a demo unit to be sold, I did NOT attempt to stress the unit.  No long term warm up and certainly no stress test.  Given the overdesigned thermal design here though, I am not worried about the measurements holding under thermal stress.MeasurementsFor reasons that will become clear later, I decided to test the power amplifier section first.  Accuphase makes this dead easy with a front-panel button \"MAIN IN\" that decouples the power amp input from pre-amp output.  This allowed me to test the power amplifier separately and compare its performance to recently tested power amps.  So let\\'s start with our 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:I have added two more panels here: gain and dc output.  Have not verified the latter but should be correct.  As we see there is a 0.4 dB gain error and variation in distortion level.  The loads I use are not precision types   so some of this may be instrumentation.  I did match levels   and distortion levels and differentials remained the same. At 92 to 95 dB SINAD, we are getting in territory of transparency for CD music.  The two distortion products are second and third harmonic at around -100 dB.Signal to Noise ratio is very good at 116 dB+:The E-270 is rated at 120 watts and it blows way past that to the tune of 155 watts prior to clipping  :You can see the comparison to recently reviewed Onkyo M-282.  The E-270 outperforms it in every category from lower noise floor and distortion to more power prior to clipping.  The Onkyo of course is a budget product at $300. On not so good news, the Hypex based NC400 amplifier way outshines the Accuphase E-270.  It has far less noise, distortion and much more power. Whoever thinks class AB amplifiers are better than switching ones like NC400, this is the time to cry!  Pre-amplifierLet\\'s isolate the pre-amplifier and measure it at unity gain  :Wow, that is quite a bit better than the power amplifier with much lower noise floor and distortion.  Don\\'t get too excited though.  There are some really odd things going on here.  Let\\'s switch inputs to XLR:What the heck??? We lost 10 dB of performance.What is really, really strange is that if I measure RCA but leave the XLR cables connected, performance drops way down just the same!   You can see it easily in signal to noise ratio measurements:Accuphase hints at much lower performance of XLR input in the specs for the product:This aside, note as I have shown on the FFT chart above how we have lots and lots of power supply related spikes.  This is evident in an FFT of the spectrum  :Switching power supplies like used in Hypex NC400 amplifier shown in the inset in blue convert mains to DC and then convert it back to AC at hundreds much higher frequency  .  As a result, you are free of mains related noise in good implementations.    There is no denying how clean the Hypex NC400 amplifier is in the audible band.  The Accuphase E-270 in contrast while cleaner than budget Onkyo M-282, has a ton of noise spikes.The problematic area for switching amplifiers is in the high frequencies so let\\'s look at that:The levels of noise and spurious tones is of course quite a bit lower than switching amplifiers.  We once again see that XLR input has worse performance  .Let\\'s now re-measure the power versus distortion using the E-270\\'s pre-amp:We have a repeat of issues with XLR input again.  Notice the performance of RCA input with   and without XLR   cable connected but not used.  And of course we leave fair amount of performance on the table with respect to the power amplifier alone. It seems that loading the pre-amp with the power amp reduces its performance substantially.  I traced this to pre-amp getting severely distorted when the power amp is under stress.  There is lack of isolation/independent power supply for the pre-amp.Story is the same with intermodulation distortion versus level:Interestingly enough the level sensitivity for XLR is the same as RCA.  I should be able to swing that to 4 volts for the same output with RCA at 2 volts.Frequency response falls in the category of very good news:I left the levels different for each input so that the graphs don\\'t fall on top of each other.  The power amplifier   has the flattest response but by just a bit.  There is really no issue in the audible band to 20 kHz.ConclusionsOn fit and finish, the Accuphase E-270 integrated Amplifier delivers for a product in low thousands of dollars.  It has the nostalgic look of 1980s product which is popular now and certainly different than common mass market products.  Its power amplifier has respectable and conservative specifications.  Measurements show it to produce far more power than stated with massive thermal capacity which should spell long service life.Unfortunately I think there are some serious engineering issues in the pre-amplifier.  The XLR input not only generates much worse performance on its own, but also serves to pollute the performance of RCA input!  There is not sufficient power/isolation for the pre-amp causing its performance to sag when the unit is asked to produce a lot of power.  These are faults that I don\\'t tolerate in mass market products, let alone higher end ones.I would say if you want to get an Accuphase product, get a power amplifier.  The integrated unit as tested just doesn\\'t do that job so sadly, I cannot recommend it.EDIT: update the price to the correct one  . --',\n",
       " '  Schiit Aegir stereo Power   amplifier.    a member who has been patiently waiting since August for its review!  The Aegir is sold direct by Schiit and costs US $799 plus shipping.The Aegir is very heavy, substantial and serious looking piece of audio gear in black:What I don\\'t like is the extra sharp edges of the heatsinks on each side where you naturally want to grab it.  But I understand extruded aluminum comes this way and having the corners marchined would be expensive.Here is the back panel:At first I was super excited to see the XLR input but became puzzled why a stereo amp only has one of them.  Then I realized that it is only for driving the unit in bridged mode.  So for most of my testing I used RCA and then used XLR for bridged power testing.I can\\'t quite tell what type of amplifier this is from technical terms Schiit uses.  They seem to want to say this is mostly a class A amplifier but then it isn\\'t at higher power?  Anyway, the Aegir runs warm but not too hot so whatever trick they are using to lower power consumption of this unit versus pure class A is working.The Aegir is a new design which was introduced in 2018.  I see Audio Precision measurements for it which means it is part of the new design philosophy to take measurements and design verification seriously.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard feeding a 1 kHz tone into the amp, aiming for 5 watt output into 4 ohm:Starting on the left side, the gain of 20 dB is on the low side.  Then again the output power is so low   that you don\\'t need a lot of gain to get to maximum power.SINAD   which is a positive dB version of THD+N mathematically  , puts the Aegir in respectable, above average ranking of all power amplifiers tested:We see good bit of power supply spikes which I verified to also exist in Schiit AP measurements.  Levels are below -100 dB so likely not audible due to our poor sensitivity in low frequencies.Frequency response is ruler flat in audible band:Signal to noise ratio is good, matching what we need for 16 bit audio playback:Multitone test tells us intermodulation between 32 tones fed to the amplifier:Once again, we see that we clear the 16 bit threshold of CD music.Most important test is power versus THD+N.  Let\\'s see that for 8 ohm:Schiit rates this amp at 20 watts into 4 ohm so we are close.  Likely they allow 1% distortion versus my standard of onset of clipping.What is puzzling is 4 ohm output:We are long ways away from 40 watts.  Then again, the clipping tilts to the right some so I suppose if you walked up that curve far enough, you get to 40 watts.  You would get good bit of distortion though so 40 watts is a marketing number.Note that one channel is more unhappy than the other.  I confirmed that exists just as well in Schiit measurements.  So likely power is fed is less efficiently to one amp than the other.  Or there are grounding, component mismatch, etc..To test bridged mode, I fed the Aegir vial XLR balanced connection and got this:I only get 23 watts of usable power which is hardly more than 19.5 watts I got in stereo mode.  The curve tilts to the right more now so marketing department went to town there to spec the \"80 watt number.\"  Measuring dynamic power which uses 1% number Schiit uses, we do get much more power:So with real music, you likely have more power than my continuous tone tests indicate.Let\\'s test how sensitive the Aegir is to input frequency:Sort of a classic output in that lower frequencies limit the amount of power available   but also have lower distortion.  I was asked to add multitone test to my amplifier measurements.  I usually use that for DACs since there, it is a lossless signal.  To use it for amplifiers, the signal has to be converted from PCM to analog which invokes the DAC in the AP.  That would put a limit on how good of a measurement I can make.  For amps like Aegir is not a limitation though so here it is:We see the general distortion floor is around -100 bits or 17 bits.  However, there are some earlier spikes due to power supply noise.  Again, our hearing is not very sensitive in that region so they can be ignored.ConclusionsThe Schiit Aegir is a competently designed amplifier with solid build quality and no design mistakes.  It shows the power of proper measurements and engineering verification to remove the element of surprise in third-party verification job we perform here.The main issue here is lack of power.  To someone like me, with very large spaces, rather inefficient speakers and desire for bass that you feel as much as you here, the Aegir is definitely not for me.  Nor do I buy into \"Class A\" having any benefit.  If it had, it would show up in measurements.  It does not.If have efficient speakers and/or don\\'t listen very loud, the Aegir is a solid offering from a western company.  I am going to put the Schiit Aegir on my recommended list for its solid engineering and design.  Fitness for application is up to you!   -',\n",
       " '  of a refurbished and upgraded NAD 2200 stereo amplifier. It was bought by a member, sent to QuirkAudio to be fully updated and then loaned to me. The work that Peter has done is exemplary.  The inside looks brand new! I have repaired hundreds of amplifiers but never seen one this clean!  So not only have the inside components been updated/replaced, but a lot of care has gone to cosmetically clean the unit. Peter sent me a long list of parts he has upgraded including reservoir capacitors and such. As a result, I don\\'t know how representative of measurements are of stock units although probably not too far off. Used 2200 go for about US $530 on ebay.The front panel is nice with an informative clipping indicator:As you see, you can put the amp in bridge mode   and select whether you want soft clipping on.  I left it off as you see in the picture.During use the protection circuit came on when appropriate and nicely reset as if nothing had happened.The NAD 2200 uses a dual voltage rail to keep power consumption and heat dissipation low when producing lower power and then upping the voltage for peak power.  This is a common technique but usually applied to low baseline power level.  Here, 100+ watts of power is provided using the low voltage power supply rail and it is only for power above that where the higher voltage is used.  Technique worked quite well as you see later and kept the amplifier cool and happy during my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Not bad!  Distortion is at or below -100 dB.  With noise, SINAD degrades to about 93 dB putting the 2200 well above average of nearly 100 amplifiers tested to date:Notice that the gain is quite high at 32 dB.  Common range is 25 to 29 dB with the latter being a \"THX\" standard.  The higher gain increases noise so despite that, performance is as good as seen.  High gain makes it a good fit for AVRs for example that produce distorted output well below nominal 2 volts.Frequency response has a sharp roll off which seems to indicate the output is not direct coupled   as is common today:Or maybe it is on purpose, I don\\'t know.Crosstalk is very good:As is dynamic range:It is power measurements where the magic of this amplifier comes to life so let\\'s look at that with 4 ohm load first:We can see a kink in distortion when we hit 200 watts as the unit sails past that to produce whopping 337 watts per channel, both driven!  Per design characteristics, you can have much more during momentary peaks:Wow, we have one kilowatt of power coming out of this amp in short duration!Switching to 8 ohm we see similar results as 4 ohm:Sweeping the power test at 4 ohm with different frequencies shows a well-behaved amplifier:You do loose power in higher frequencies but that is fine since music spectrum has lower energy there anyway.Due to the long duration of this test, the protection circuit likely backed off the high voltage rail, producing lower output levels.EDIT: adding Lab Input MeasurementsLab Input MeasurementsI was surprised that the frequency response was not flat but was relieved to see later in the thread that this is due to insertion of low and high pass filters.  So here is the frequency response with Lab input that doesn\\'t have such a filter:Response now   as it should be, ruler flat to below 10 Hz, and well extending past the 40 kHz limit of this measurement.I  ured the filters may be adding some noise/distortion so re-ran the dashboard again:Distortion doesn\\'t change but if you look at the noise floor at 20 Hz, it is down by some 10 dB.  That improves SINAD a couple of dBs, making the amplifier stand out even more!Zoomed:And signal to noise ratio:ConclusionsNice to see innovation like this from equipment that is over 30 years old!  Shame on manufacturers that produce amplifiers for much less power, more distortion and higher prices these days.  No, you don\\'t get a fancy case here and sheet metal is strictly budget category.  But you are not going to sit on the amp.  The guts are where it matters and NAD 2200 delivers.NOTE: the output relay on stock 2200 gets corroded and fails over time.  There are videos and DIY threads on how to upgrade the relay there to fix the problem.  The unit tested here has that fix.  Other than that, there are not reports of many other reliability issues even though NAD products are often said to be less reliable than other brands.Overall, I am happy to recommend the NAD 2200.  I almost gave it the highest honors but given the upgraded nature of the test unit, and the fact that used amps may have issues, I avoided that.  But you could have easily pushed me to give it the golfing panther. ',\n",
       " ' Devialet Expert 200 Amplifier, DAC, Phono premaplifier and wired streamer.  It seems to be a generation behind the current products offered by Devialet.  The Expert 200 cost US $9,650. The Devialet line of amplifiers made quite a buzz when originally announced given its unique, lifestyle packaging which has not changed yet:A combination of class A amplifier and class D current source is used to keep the size down, and efficiency up. Innovative for its time was inclusion of an SD card and online con urator to change the operation of the unit including re-purposing the back RCA connectors:The thin package creates real compromises here with the exclusion of balanced analog inputs or preamp outputs. Usability suffers quite a bit as well with the display being on top of the unit which simply is not visible from afar.  There is provision for wall-mounting but come on, no audiophile is going to do that and then dangle the cables from it.There is a very substantial remote but strangely has no display on it.  That would consume a lot more power, likely requiring a charger and such.Trying to troubleshoot a problem let me to going to their con urator site and downloading SD images some 10 times.  I have to tell you, it gets old taking the SD card out of the unit, plugging it into a PC, making a simple change, put it back in the unit, wait for a restart, to see the effect.  Granted, you only do this once in a while but during experimentation is quite tedious.  In this day and age, such con urator should be inside the unit and activated vi an app or with a browser.  The data on the SD card is very small anyway  .  So it is not like it is data intensive.Overall, I think looks are put way ahead of function on Davialet amplifiers. I had planned to do a much more extensive review of this unit but sadly, right after my first power sweep, it shut down and no longer powers back on.    The online brochure talks extensive about protection measures.  Clearly they are not enough as I suspect the microprocessor board has failed as opposed to the amplifier that has health monitoring.  I am hoping Devialet is responsive to this review and failure and make good on repairing this unit.  I have never had an amplifier fail in such a simple sweep that keeps the power max for just a few seconds.Anyway, I had accumulated enough data that I thought it is worthwhile to post it while waiting for a response from Devialet.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsThe Devialet amplifiers digitize their analog inputs so I thought I start with our dashboard of 5 watts driving using USB input:Distortion products are quite low at < -110 dB.  However, the noise floor is high in low frequencies causing our SINAD to suffer a lot, ending with a metric of 92 dB.  This is well above average compared to all the amplifiers we have measured but way short of state-of-the-art:Analog input creates a lot of harmonic distortion and with it, drags down SINAD a few notches still:I don\\'t understand how their ADC could distort so much in a product this expensive.  It can\\'t even clear 15 bits of distortion-free range.There are some lofty numbers like -130 dB noise floor is thrown around by Devialet.  I am not sure how that is computed.  Using analog Line-in for consistency with other amplifier measurements we get rather ordinary numbers:Crosstalk is good but again, not state of the art:At this point I went to measure a simple frequency response and got stomped  big time.  No matter what I did, the output would drop off randomly between 8 and 10 kHz.  As mentioned, I messed with the con urator, doing everything in my power to turn off filters, tone controls, etc., nothing helped.  So I dug in with just feeding the amp a 15 kHz tone and noticed that the output would jump up and down especially in one channel!  What the heck is going on????My frequency response testing is at 5 watts as that is what I use in my dashboard.  Turns out this amplifier cannot reproduce high frequencies reliably at 5 watts!  It has some kind of limiter that kicks in and pulls power back.  It also does that at low frequencies but at or past maximum power.  That I can sort of understand but not the high frequency hold back.  To see this in action, I ran my THD+N vs Level vs Power test:Focus on the red line first.  That is at 20 kHz.  Notice how it actually zigzags back and forth as input level is increased, but output level does not.  Or even goes backward!  This must be the \"good\" channel as it produced 10 watts.  The other channel was more finicky and as noted, would get upset at even 5 watts.Problem severity goes down with frequencies but still there at 10 kHz as indicated by the light blue line which zips back at around 180 watts or so.At lower frequencies, the amp simply refuses to increase power and not go into clipping.With this knowledge, I reduced output power to below 1 watt and ran my frequency response sweep:This is line-in so is digitized.  It produces about 48 kHz of bandwidth which is fine.  What is not so fine is that there is a phase shift between channels as frequencies go up:Some kind of filter is active here that is causing a phase shift between channels.  Even if there is some processing active  , it should affect both channels equally as far as phase.Our story ends with my power measurement as noted:This is healthy amount of power at 269 watts with both channels driven into 4 ohms.ConclusionsWhile the Devialet is an elegant looking audio device, it clearly sacrifices usability and reliability/performance to get there.  There is something clearly wrong in the way it handles high frequencies.  No, this is not just me saying that.  It is also buried in the stereophile measurement of another one of their units:  $10,000 amplifier can\\'t produce more than 20 watts at high frequencies without \"power supply collapsing?\"  Conclusions like this don\\'t help:No, this is not a testament to how good an amplifier can get.  No amplifier should power limit to just 20 watts   in high frequencies.  We have issues with class D amps generating out of band noise that causes measurements to be low in this regard.  But they are producing full power.  Not so with Devialet. Then we have the phase shift.  Poor usability with \"sneaker net\" style of shuffling SD cards back and forth to make simple changes.And of course the total failure of the unit under a simple industry standard test of power sweep.I feel sad that an amplifier has failed under my watch.  I hope Devialet steps up and makes this right for the owner.  -',\n",
       " \" Emotiva PA-1 monoblock class D amplifier.      unfortunately discontinued.  When it was being sold, it cost $299.There is not much to look at here other than a blue indicator for when the unit is on:It is a balanced amplifier which is nice:There is an automatic trigger as you see. I tested it using always-on mode.I believe this is based on some ICEPower module from B&O  .  In use the PA-1 didn't even get warm to touch.  Protection circuit was very good in that if you overload it, it clips but keeps going.  Other amps shut down requiring power cycling and such which an become annoying in my testing.Emotiva PA-1 MeasurementsOur standard dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm   shows very good performance:Distortion is at -100 dB which is quite nice making SINAD around 92 dB:This is well above our average of 78 across nearly 140 amplifiers tested to date.SNR is very good nearly matching my target of 96 dB at 5 watts:Multitone shows the same good performance:Frequency response unfortunately shows dependency on speaker impedance:Power into 4 ohm shows early rise of distortion:I cut off the power early in that graph.  If one allows it to go higher in distortion it produces a lot more power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Changing frequency shows what non-state-of-the-art class Ds produce:Namely a transfer function that changes with frequency and much higher distortion.Here is the spectrum of the switching frequency:ConclusionsIt is hard to get perfection at this price point but the Emotiva PA-1 tries hard.  It is a small package that runs cool yet produces well above average noise and distortion ratings.  It is a shame it is discontinued.I am going to put the Emotiva PA-1 on my recommended list.  Hopefully you can find some in second hand market or something. -\",\n",
       " \" Yamaha R-N803 Receiver, amplifier, and streamer.  It was purchased by a member   and drop shipped to me.  The R-N803 costs US $750 from amazon including Prime shipping.The R-N803 has AV-style features such as Room EQ but with only two channels of amplification.  It has a retro look which is quite a bit nicer than an AVR though:Alas, beauty is only skin deep.  Those nice vertical controls are loose and have nowhere near the great feel of the 1970s gear with their solid mechanical selectors.  The back panel shows how the video features have been stripped away:As a package, it is much more appealing than the monster size of typical AVR.  So not a bad effort.Internally there are decent size heat sinks, one for each channel.  This is a huge step up from a shared flimsy heat sinks we see in modern AVRs with many channels.  This resulted in high robustness as in my testing, nothing caused the R-N803 to shut down or go into protection mode.  With AVRs it is common for them to do these things even though I still drive them with just two channels.Receiver Amplifier TestingI exclusively used the CD input for my testing.  There is a button for Pure Direct as there is on AVRs so let's engage that and see what we get:I set the volume control to +3 db to get the nominal 29 dB of gain.  Measurements were not that different at 0 dB.  I had to play fair bit to get rid of some ground loops  .  Once there, I was rewarded with pretty good SINAD which is a combined measure of distortion and noise:As you see, the ranking is way above average of just 77 dB SINAD.Switching off pure direct mode however, causes severe performance drop:Noise floor as moved massively up and distortion has increased.  Now we are back in the poor category of AVRs.  Sadly to use Room EQ you need to operate in this mode so you have a tough decision of whether you want to have low noise/distortion or room EQ.Dynamic range in pure mode is good:As is crosstalk:Frequency response is excellent in pure mode as well:Turning off pure   causes a sharp drop near 50 kHz which seems to indicate the input is digitized using 96 kHz sampling.  It is nice that this rate is a lot higher than many AVRs use.  Not so nice is the non-flat response even though I set all the controls to the middle.There is plenty of power into 4 ohm load at lower distortion and noise than a number of AVRs:Switching to 8 ohm load and measuring pure and non-pure modes, shows the poor performance of the latter:I had a slight issue with this test.  Just minor wiggling of the speaker terminals caused one channel to get distorted much earlier.  Not sure what is going on with that.Back to 4 ohm load, we see that we have plenty of headroom for momentary peaks in music:And here is our power test with different frequencies:At low frequencies approaching 20 Hz, distortion rises above 60 watts or so  .  Otherwise, this is a predictable performance with high frequencies being a bit more distorted than low.  And this is a good thing compared to nasty curves with get in some switching amplifiers.ConclusionsAs a pure, analog integrated amplifier, the Yamaha R-N803 does well.  It produces ample amount of power into 4 ohm with pretty low distortion and noise.  The visuals are also quite attractive.  Digital mode to use such things as Auto-EQ/filters is rather poor due to similar issues in many AVRs.  Sad that Yamaha did not go the extra mile and produce a better subsystem here.I personally don't like to use an AVR as a stereo setup due to their large size and not so pretty face plate.  So in that regard, I appreciate the Yamaha R-N803.Given the good, pure analog mode performance, and nice looks, I am going to put the Yamaha R-N803 on my recommended list.  \",\n",
       " ' Audiophonics DA-S250NC class D amplifier   and stereo DAC/Bluetooth. It was requested by   supplied by the company. It costs 582,50 €    .I really like the front panel display.  It has large font and super responsive rotary encoder that is a delight to use.  The power switch and input selections feel good as well.  Back panel shows the fact that only digital inputs are provided:In use the unit was robust in operation and recovered automatically from overloads.Audiophonics DA-S250NC DAC MeasurementsUsing pre-out,   performance of the DAC.  Let\\'s start with our dashboard:I was surprised that I could not get more than 0.8 volt out of the pre-out. Like to see 2 volts.  Likely this is optimized for the gain setting of the integrated amplifier. Distortion is below -110 dB but because output level is rather low, noise drags that down to SINAD of 103 dB.  This is still competent performance:SNR is good enough for 16 bit content:Linearity is near perfect:Multitone is quite good until you get to upper registers:IMD vs level shows that impact of noise level:There were regular pulses at 1 KHz which is the USB sub-packet buffer size:I tried changing the filter settings but they seemingly made no difference:Might as well as this is a fine choice anyway.  Attenuation could be better, hurting THD+N vs frequency:Overall performance of the DAC is not bad.  Question is, is it good enough to not impact the amplifier performance?Audiophonics DA-S250NC Amplifier MeasurementsUsing the same USB input, I measured performance by setting the front panel volume control to -16.5 dB to get 5 watts and change output:This is very good performance, landing the amplifier well above average of all products ever tested:Zooming in:Noise performance is very good, almost meeting my 16 bit minimum SNR at 5 watts:Frequency response is nice in that it doesn\\'t show any load dependency:Crosstalk is better than average of all amps tested:Multitone test shows very good performance with almost no frequency dependency:I could barely get the amplifier to clip at max digital input/volume control:This tells me that we could have a bit more output voltage from the DAC to drive the amplifier.  This impacts 8 ohm more:Note that you want to operate in clipping region but a bit of power is left on the table as far as measurements are concerned.Since the amplifier barely distorts, I could not run my standard max and peak power using 1% THD metric.  I had to dial that down to 0.3% get max power:I was not able to run burst power due to same issue.  Note again that this is a \"good thing\" in that the amplifier just doesn\\'t distort enough to get more burst power.Let\\'s switch the load now from 8 to 2 ohm while also changing the phase angle as to represent capacitive and inductive loads:I am impressed that it handled 2 ohm at all but 60 degrees capacitive.  Output voltage dropped though so you don\\'t get to keep \"doubling down.\"  Likewise we lose output voltage at the extremes of ± 60 degrees at 4 and 8 ohm.Finally, as I suspected, you get double power on glitch with the amp and DAC powering on in sequence, resulting in some noise:ConclusionsThe DA-S250NC caught my eye from the moment I looked at the website.  The combination of a DAC and class D amplifier just makes sense to me for most people who only want a digital input. Many \"smart\" amplifiers exist in this domain but they are usually compromised.  Seeing a DAC married to hypex amplifier and combined with a nice front panel/remote seemed to be the ticket.  In testing, the DAC performance is just good but seems to be mating well enough to the amplifier.  Any more performance and it would kind be wasted there.  So I can\\'t complain much.  A version of this with higher performance DAC and amplifier would be just dandy!  Overall, I like and recommend the Audiophonics DA-S250NC. -',\n",
       " ' NAD C 320BEE power   amplifier.  It is on kind loan.  The C 320BEE is a vintage product, dating back to 2003 I think.  The BEE designation is apparently a reference to Bjorn Erik Edvardsen who was one of their designers.  Can\\'t tell if he designed this version or this is based on work he did years earlier.  Either way, I am told it is a \"classic.\"  I don\\'t keep up with such things but I am sure some of you will set me straight if that is, or isn\\'t so.  From what I can tell the original cost was US $399.  So quite a budget piece for a mid-tier brand like NAD.The C 320BEE is typical of NAD design language which is maintained to this day:There are set of tone controls and balance which I appreciate in this day and age when it is removed from most gear.I did not seek out the manual and remain unsure how this thing powers on.  You hit the power button but nothing happens until you press one of the input buttons???Here is the back panel:It is an old school layout with non-removable power cord, jumper set for pre to power map.  And a set of RCA jacks lined up.The unit appears to run cool but there are large holes on the bottom where the amplifier heatsink is and if you touch that heatsink, it gets quite hot.In testing, without undue stress, the unit went into protection and would not reset until I cooled it off with a fan and left it off for a few minutes.  Most amps survive my testing without going into protection mode since I only push them to max power for seconds.Also, in the process of changing my setup for 4 to 8 ohm, the unit went into oscillation, producing 107 watts on its own with no signal.  So there is some instability in the design.  This happened when I changed my load impedance to 8 ohm so perhaps you won\\'t see it if you don\\'t mess with speaker output while the unit is on.To be on the safe side, for the last few tests I put a fan on top to keep it cool and that got it to run very reliably. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:The highest distortion product is at -100 dB.  Since out SINAD  , is only 90 dB, it means there is 10 dB of noise that is degrading that.  All else being equal, noise is less of an audible problem than distortion so that is good.  Take at its value, the C 320BEE clocks much better than many other amplifiers we have measured in this regard:Drilling into the 1 kHz tone spectrum we see the nice clean output of classic AB amplifier:Those of you who hate class-D spectra in ultrasonics, can rejoice now.  Signal to noise ratio is good but is power dependent:I think the spec is a few dBs better than this but I am sure you can mess with levels and volume control position to get there.  Either way, this is plenty clean for CD/16-bit playback.Crosstalk is unremarkable compared to state-of-the-art:Fortunately, this should not be an audible issue as there is plenty of separation between channels here.  Frequency response is broad and quite flat in audible band:Even at 100 kHz, the response is only down 1 dB.  So your high-resolution music can sing without the amplifier truncating their bandwidth.Let\\'s look at intermodulation distortion   versus power output:This is a well-behaved amplifier until it gets to its limit and then clips hard as amplifiers tend to do.  Of note, there is a \"soft clip\" light but I did not see it come on in any of my tests.We can run the same test but with two high frequency tones of 19 and 20 kHz:Forgetting about the ultrasonic ones around 38 kHz, the distortion sidebands remain at -100 dB which is very nice.  You can play your 16 bit content without worrying about any distortion above its noise floor.Most important test is power versus distortion.  Let\\'s start with 4 ohm load:This is very modest level of power but no strangeness in its response.  We can run the test again but compare to modern \"streaming\" amplifiers of today:We have very clean power compared to them but less power as compared to either SONOS or Amazon Link Amp.  The NAD does outperform the NuForce STA-200 though in every respect.  Switching to 8 ohm gets us this:I am puzzled that power output remains identical in both cases.  Something must be controlling that.The graph of distortion versus frequency at power levels is quite messy as it typically is:Putting aside the light pink which is at or near clipping, the amp if well behaved with only a modest rise in distortion as power levels increase.To keep things exciting , I added a new measurement to this test.  It is the \"dynamic\" power according to CEA-2006/490A designed to keep car audio amplifier companies honest with peak power:These are burst power measurements.  Let me know if you like them and I will run them in future reviews.  I think there is some merit to measuring this way as music is not continuous sine wave.ConclusionsNice to go back in time and test amplifiers which were simple to understand and simple to measure.  The NAD C 320BEE seems to have been competently designed for modest power delivery at a budget price.  In that regard, it completely succeeds in its mission.Personally, I think 67 watts is not enough for home listening.  Today\\'s speakers have become smaller in size and shrunk in efficiency, needing fair bit of power to get them to produce proper dynamics.  If you disagree otherwise, or have sensitive speakers, the NAD C 320BEE seems to be a good unit to buy.  It certainly does away with any anxiety you may have with using class-D amplification. -',\n",
       " ' Yamaha WXA-50, multi-function DAC, pre-amp, power amp, streaming and multi-room unit. Even though it came out a few years ago  , it is widely available.  Amazon shows it costs US $478.Success of SONOS as a multi-room audio solution has been the envy of many traditional audio companies.  Many have tried to chase them with Yamaha being one of the earlier ones.The WXA-50 is a surprisingly heavy unit although looks somewhat unremarkable:The case is metal as best as I can tell which is good as the unit generates good bit of heat.  Strangely the heat is concentrated on the left side yet the vents are on the right!  There is an IR hole on the left which confused me to no end, constantly wanting to push it to turn on the unit.  I am not a fan of a single light indicating input and overload condition of the amplifier.  Worst part of the interface is the volume control which has no marking and no display.  Unless you use the app, you have no idea what volume you have set this to.  This made my testing maddeningly hard.I downloaded the App and here, I was pleasantly surprised by the performance and reliability of it.  With no con uration, the WXA-50 was recognized and manipulating its controls were instantaneous and reliable.  I only used the App to reset the EQ, etc. so for its full functionality, you should seek out other reviews.The back panel has extensive set of inputs and outputs although lacks USB:I was pleased to see both analog input and outputs.Yamaha heavily courted the Custom Install   industry to use this instead of SONOS and it shows from inclusion of trigger input and output for control.  Inclusion of Toslink input goes along these lines to fetch audio from a TV being fed by HDMI.DAC Audio MeasurementsI briefly measured DAC performance.  I read however that there are two DAC chips inside this unit   and that the fixed output is driven by the latter.  So this may not be representative of what happens when you stream music into this device:This is decent performance although it degraded fair bit if I turned up the volume on the amplifier to max.  That increased the higher order harmonics even though the output level of the DAC did not change.  We have seen this before and likely is the power supply sagging causing DAC performance to suffer.  SInce you don\\'t listen at max volume level, I did not derate the WXA-50 performance when including it in the performance chart:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsSince we have analog inputs, I started my testing using that and got this for our usual dashboard at roughly 5 watts:I played around with combination of input levels and volume control and performance was pretty consistent.  SINAD   is actually quite respectable for an amplifier:  same, this time using Roon to stream the 1 kHz tone to it using Airplay:We lose just a couple of dBs although distortion levels are a bit lower.From here on,   unit using its analog input unless specified.Frequency response shows decent bandwidth and flat response in audible band:No strange and limiting digitization of input is visible which is good.Signal to noise ratio is good enough for 16 bit audio:Let\\'s get into all important measurement: power into 4 ohm versus distortion:We are close to meeting the spec  .  We have cleaner power than either Sonos or Amazon amps although the SONOS has much more power.Here is the performance at 8 ohm:I don\\'t have as much data for 8 ohm but what is there, shows competent performance but with just 55 watts on tap.Intermodulation distortion versus power level tells a similar story:THD+N versus frequency and power shows very predictable performance with no corner cases exposed:Only 20 Hz tones gives it a bit of trouble with rising distortion above 10 watts but that is slight.The unit also shut down at 20 kHz at max clipping level. I reduced the volume level a few notches and that went away even though I was still pushing the unit into hard clipping.Spectrum of 1 kHz tone with no AES filter shows the usual noise in high frequencies we get from class-D amps:While this looks ugly, the spikes near audio band are way down at -75 dB which is very good.  I have tested amps where these levels are much, much higher.The two channels have different switching frequencies.  Not sure if this is on purpose or variation in the clock source of their modulators.  The two beat against each other likely creating the intermodulation spikes that we see throughout the range.ConclusionsUnlike the bag of parts performance I often see in these modern streaming products, the Yamaha WXA-50 seems to have benefited from some attention to raw performance of each subsystem.  There are no funny results, strange pipelines that go in and out of digital domain, etc.  The performance graphs are all smooth with no sudden jaggies or other anomalies.  This makes it easier to use the unit, not having to work around its weakness  .We also have decent amount of power, approaching 100 watts into 4 ohm which should be plenty.  If you add the subwoofer to it, you will be golden even at high SPLs.The app likewise, gives a feeling of polish that I often find lacking in competing products.In summary, I did not raise an eyebrow when measuring the Yamaha WXA-50.  It won\\'t provide competition to state-of-the-art separate products but it also doesn\\'t embarrass.  As such, I am going to put the WXA-50 on my recommended list.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.I was reading that the standard diet for panthers is large animals such as deer, antelope, etc.  I have not fed anything like that to my panthers and they are starting to mumble \"animal abuse\" under the lips.

       " ' PS Audio Stellar S300 Stereo Power Amplifier. The S300 costs US $1,499 from the company.Fitting the design language of the rest of the PS Audio and using similar enclosure, the S300 is quite hefty considering that it uses class-D amplification:There is just a power switch and light that indicates whether the unit is on, or has shut down due to protection circuit kicking in.The back panel shows very high quality and beefy connectors:As you see, there are redundant pairs of speaker sockets which I assume is an invitation to use bi-wiring.  Or feed the subwoofer using them as Paul McGowan advocates although a warning tells you to be careful as these are floating signals, not ground referenced.XLR inputs are nicely provided which I used for all of my testing.The internal amplification is provided by ICEpower 300AS1 modules.  These are integrated power supply and single channel amplifier modules.   PS Audio uses its own input buffer on these which they call \"Analog Cell.\"  This got the owner worried that it would measure poorly as did the PS Audio Stellar Gain Cell Preamplifier and DAC.  I must say it got me worried reading the description of it too:Seeing how the class-d module uses ample feedback to linearize its response, it is puzzling that he thinks the input stage should be without one.  Either feedback is good ro bad.  Can\\'t have it both ways.Anyway, back to the operation of the unit, it ran cool and never got upset in my testing.  Overall, my subjective impression of the unit is positive.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs always, we start with 5 watt output into 4 ohm and see where we stand:Ah, that is respectable!  FFT spectrum just shows two distortion products with the second one at or below -100 dB.  There is however noise though which pushes the combination of those distortions and noise to -88 dB resulting in SINAD of same amount, only positive.  This puts the S300 amplifier above our median for all power amplifiers tested so far:Our frequency response is a bit variable at the high end:I looked up the 300AS1 response as shown in the inset and is consistent with that.  While most of us won\\'t hear that rise in response, it does show load dependency which means each speaker will interact with it differently.All my tests use an AES-17 filter which has a flat response to 40 kHz and beyond.  But for the purposes of finding the actual high-bandwidth spectrum of the unit, I take it out for this test of 1 kHz tone at 5 watt:Switching frequency is around 450 kHz which is fine.  Typical of many of these class-d modules, the level is high at just -15 dB below signal. @DonH56 recently asked me if the level of switching noise tracks the signal itself so I decided to test for that by upping the power by a good bit to 180 watts and see what happens:As you see in blue, there is good news and bad news.  Good news is that the level doesn\\'t scale with output power much.  Bad news is that its spectrum becomes quite wide so total energy may have increased that much.  Certainly scary to the eye but likely not to the ear.  Anyway, back to our regular programming, here is our signal to noise ratio:Not that good at 5 watt as we could have predicted from the SINAD in the dashboard.  At full power the situation improves but still not very competitive with top of the class switching amplifiers which can clock as high as 125 dB.  So be careful with sensitive speakers.Most important graph for amplifiers is power versus distortion+noise.  Here it is into 4 ohm:We have tons of good power to the tune of 256 watts.  Distortion starts to rise early though at just 10 watts.Here is the response into 8 ohm:Perhaps more revealing is what happens if we perform the same sweep but at different frequencies starting at 20 kHz and working our way down to 20 Hz.  An ideal amplifier would have all the graphs landing on top of each other.  But this is what we get here:At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the graphs indeed nicely land on top of each other  .  But at 5 kHz and higher, we get very odd responses indicating multiple non-linearities taking turn to dominate.  I thought this was an issue with PS Audio implementation but the same response is shown by ICEPower in their data sheet.Peak power shows disappointing level of headroom available for short durations as would be typical in music:The switching power supplies in class-d amplifiers are tightly regulated which means the power you get in steady-state, is what you get in peak.  Standard class AB amplifiers tend to have variable supply rails which if you don\\'t tax much, will maintain higher voltage and produce more power in short bursts.  For this reason, you may want to get a more powerful class D amplifier to replace a class AB amp.ConclusionsIt is a sigh of relief that PS Audio had not managed to reduce the performance of the ICEPower modules.  Response and sonic abilities are completely determined by those modules unlike what PS Audio marketing says.  The ICEPower module used here has a distinctly lower performance than Hypex modules we have tested in the past. So you are not going to get state-of-the-art performance.  For that, you need to go to amplifiers higher in the SINAD graph.Still, this is a competent, well-built and well-supported amplifier based on proven amplification modules within.  Build quality is much higher than DIY or garage shop amplifiers using Hypex modules.  $1,500 is not a ton of money given these attributes.  For these reasons and good looks of the unit, I am going to put the PS Audio Stellar S300 amplifier on my recommended list. -',\n",
       " \" NAD 7050 integrated DAC, amplifier and streaming playback. It appears the product was announced in 2014 and since discontinued as I can't find it on sale anywhere.  The cost was USD $999 from what I can gather.The unit can be used both horizontally and vertically.  A rotational sensor changes the display orientation conveniently.  Here is its upright position which I consider better for sound since the electrons can naturally free fall into the speaker terminals:The outside has what appears to be some sort of rubber glued to it.  It is soft to touch but picks up dirt very easily and is impossible to clean due to sticky nature of it.The large knobs imply great feel which they don't have.  They wobble as you rotate them.  The larger knob is the volume control which had an odd delay in updating the display as you rotated it.  Overall, a good effort has been made to create an unusual design but didn't quite get there in feel and functionality.The back panel shows off the inputs and speaker output:For my testing, I focused on USB input as I suspect that is the most common interface for consumers.  Alas, the USB interface is class one so only goes up to 96 kHz.  To get the advertised 192 kHz you need to use the other inputs.  I downloaded the NAD drivers which nicely gave me ASIO interface for testing.There is an app to control it and I downloaded it from Android play store.  It is a simple remote control but allowed me to change the audio-out to be full range so I could use it for DAC testing.  Otherwise it is filtered for subwoofer out.  Despite its simplicity the app crashed on me once.There is no analog input so I had do all of my testing with USB digital interface.As expected from a brand name company, the NAD 7050 comes with full set of safety and emissions regulatory certifications.The amplification in NAD 7050 apparently is a scaled down version of what is in NAD M2.  Here is what NAD says about it:My read is that it is a power DAC similar to Lyngdorf TDAI-3400 I reviewed recently.  Measurements will confirm if so.DAC MeasurementsAs usual, where possible I try to isolate the performance of the subsystems, in this case the DAC.  Here is our dashboard view using USB input/Line Out.  I hope you are sitting down if you owan the 7050 and use it as a DAC:What the heck is going on here?  Even at 0 dB the unit doesn't get to 2 volts yet it severely clips resulting all of those harmonic distortions.  Dialing down to -2 dBFS improved performance but just to 83 dB. By then the output voltage was even lower, making it not so useful as a DAC anyway.  My thinking is that this is a split off output from the power amplifier as opposed to a traditional DAC output.   I guess for the assumed subwoofer duty it may be OK.Naturally, with the SINAD as measured falls at the bottom of the graph of DACs tested:After the first bad impression, the 7050 almost nails the rest of the measurements such as linearity:And jitter:Since USB doesn't support 192 kHz, I had to run a different multi-tone test at 44.1 kHz:Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual, the dashboard view is at 5 watts of power into 4 ohm:As power amplifier measurements go, this is not too bad actually and almost matches the vaguely stated 90 dB spec by NAD.Power versus distortion+noise is also pretty decent:The downward part of the curve is always dominate by noise as the output level is low.  Here, that part of the curve is flatter than I am used to seeing which is good as far as level of noise.  Likewise, distortion is kept under complete control until onset of sudden and massive clipping at 54 watts.  This too is good  .  Stated rating is 50 watts at 4 ohm and we beating that a bit which is nice.  Then again, 50 watts is not that much power in grand scheme of things.THD+N versus frequency using my default 45 kHz bandwidth shows pretty awful results  :Suspecting ultrasonic noise at play, I re-ran the test with 22.4 kHz   in blue which shows that effect quite conclusively.  One channel is worse than the other though which is strange.  Note that the drop above a few Khz is due to bandwidth of the test being too low to capture all the harmonics  .Broadband FFT shows of 1 kHz tone shows us what is going on:This is without my Audio Precision high-frequency filter  .  All the other tests used that filter.On the extreme left we see our 1 kHz tone as a spike rising to 0 dB or so.  We have a single and large spike at 850 kHz.  That seems to indicate to me that 850 kHz may be the switching frequency.  Given its high frequency, the power DAC is running likely with as a single bit converter which would create a lot of quantization noise.  Noise shaping is used to push that above 30 kHz or so with the peak at about 80 kHz.  This is the drawback of power DACs as we have seen in the Lyngdorf and SONOS Amp versus class D amplification which doesn't need noise shaping.  You can see the effect of high frequency noise in the thickened sine wave of the same signal in the inset.ConclusionsUsually, by the time I get to the end of testing, I have a good idea of if I like or don't like a device.  Here, I am not quite sure.  Let's agree that no one should be using the NAD 7050 as a DAC with external amplification as NAD suggests in the manual.  You will be listening to a heap of distortion products with anemic output to boot.The amplifier seems to have some good tricks under its sleeves with lower than normal noise and very controlled distortion until a very hard limit.  My issue there is the 50 watt rating for a $1000 device.  That is just not enough power for a product in this category.Seeing how the NAD 7050 is discontinued, maybe it doesn't need my recommendation or lack thereof anyway.  So I will leave it at that.   -\",\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier.   costs US $89.99 with stock 32 volt supply.  Price goes up to $109.99 with the 48 volt supply.  There is a $10 discount coupon right now.Despite its budget price, the V3 manages to look elegant with the hole pattern on top and large and smooth feeling Volume/On/Off control. Power supply is external and as noted, you get a choice:As you will see later, you really want the 48 volt version:Yes, it is a larger supply but you are going to hide it behind your desk anyway so might as well live the good life with the increased power there.  The amplifier is based on TI TPA3255 class D amplifier IC.  There are replaceable op-amps for those of you who have nothing better to do than mess with the design.When I took the amplifier out of the package, I noticed something rattling in there.  Fearing the worst, I took the unit apart. Turns out one of the two large power supply caps had lost its adhesion to the PCB. The putty used is to keep the cap glued to the PCB was too flexible and had broken loose. No harm though as the cap is laying on its side and can\\'t go anywhere. The sound I was hearing was it moving just a hair up and down and hitting the top of the case.  Suggest company use a different material to fix this.I will post the pictures of the insides later.  For now, a large aluminum couples the amplifier IC to the case. There is no thermal grease but the amp ran cool enough that I don\\'t think you need to worry about it. But if you are, this you can remedy yourself.  Despite me pushing the amp to max power repeatedly, it just got warm to touch.  The protection circuit was the best kind with high tolerance of clipping and audio-restart.Fosi Audio V3 Amplifier MeasurementsI performed the low power tests using the 32 volt supply.  The rest is done with both.  So let\\'s start with our usual dashboard:Distortion is nicely kept to -100 dB so we are noise limited causing SINAD to land around 88 dB.  This is well above average for all amplifiers tested:Notice how many amplifiers it beats to the right of it!Noise performance is also quite good for the class, almost clearing the hurdle for 16 bit content at just 5 watts:Frequency response shows load dependency which all class D amplifiers in this price range show:In English, this means that depending on which speaker you use, the sound may be a bit bright or a bit dull if your hearing extends to 20 kHz.  You can counter with EQ  .Multitone and 19+20 kHz show good performance for the class:Edit: forgot to post crosstalk measurement:Let\\'s see how much power we can get out of this little box into 4 ohm:You normally wouldn\\'t expect to get more power with a 48 volt supply compared to 32 volt when their current ratings are the same.  But as I noted in the picture at the start, the larger power supply is conservatively rated and is able to pump out more current for peaks.  We can see this in our short-term power measurements:With 8 ohm volt, we are more in need of voltage so naturally we get tons more there as well with the 48 volt supply:Transfer function is quite good for class D and I was especially impressed with its ability to pump out same power at high frequencies as many amplifiers go into protection there:There is some pop noise when turning on and off but it is very mild:The amplifier is stable on power up:Some of you have been aiming at creating more work for me by asking for for efficiency tests. I developed a test that is semi-automatic and provides reasonable accuracy  :Note that part of the heat is dissipated in the power supply and part in the amp.  The X axis is power per channel, not total  .Edit: here are the teardown pictures:ConclusionsState of the art DACs run on highly performant silicon that when well implemented, produces the best performance we have seen.  We are seeing similar development with these class D IC amplifiers.  Noise and distortion is quite low and beats many amplifiers in the market.  They bring two drawbacks: external power supplies and load dependencies.  If the latter is resolved, these amplifiers would obsolete large segment of the audio market!The Fosi Audio V3 is well implemented and brings nice looks and design at a bargain price.  Company is also quite receptive to customer input and is a delight to work with behind the scenes.  I don\\'t know what else we could ask for!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier.EDIT: a few pages in the thread claim was made that the input buffer opamp must be fake as they don\\'t look like the official TI chip packaging.  Company chimed in a couple of days later saying they bought the ICs directly from TI.  And showed the purchase order proving the same.  It seems the \"internet got this wrong\" as far as what constitutes a fake as TI is using two different factories with different packaging. ',\n",
       " ' Denon PMA-50 Audio   amplifier with included DAC and Bluetooth.    a member. It seems to be discontinued but when available, it cost US $599.  I see it on ebay and such from $370 to $450.The enclosure is more stout and nicer looking/feeling than a lot of products in this category:The volume control is large and nice feeling.  It works a bit odd though in that when you first turn it, it switches the display to volume level but doesn\\'t do anything with respect to changing the level.  You need to keep turning it to have it take effect.There is a headphone amp which I did not test yet.  May do that later.Back panel shows a nice suite of digital and analog inputs but no line out for the DAC:I performed all of my testing with USB and a bit with analog Aux input.Included mains power supply gets rid of the tangle of wires that comes with external supplies.Internally this is a \"DDFA\" design which means it accepts digital input and converts it to PWM for amplification. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI started my initial test with USB input to the amplifier and got this:While not state-of-the-art, performance is above average for amplifiers we have tested with respect to distortion:Using analog input degrades performance fair bit:We lose about 5 dB, mostly in elevated noise level.  Note the channel mismatch when you use analog input as opposed to digital.Frequency response using USB input and high sample rate of 192 kHz, shows the noise shaping/filtering of the digital amplifier:Young people with good hearing may hear some elevated sharpness.  Total bandwidth though is better than some other amps we have tested which truncate at 22 kHz and such.Looking at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone, we see a very well behaved amplifier despite being class-D:Ultrasonic noise is limited to -60 dB.  Some other products have peaks as high as -20 dB here.  There is a single spike at 840 kHz or so, which is likely the switching frequency.Note that I did not have to use my AES filter as I usually do with class D amp.  The analyzer was not confused by the ultrasonic noise as present.Using USB input we get very clean signal until the amp stops producing power:54 watts of power slightly beats the 50 watt specification into 4 ohm.  Alas, this is not much power, relegating the unit to office, small room use.As expected, power drops with 8 ohm load:I suggest getting a 4 ohm speaker to extract the max power out of the unit.Using analog input, we can compare the power at 4 ohm to other amps tested.  Here again, the gain was strange as turning it up to 0 dB, caused elevated noise and very early clipping.  So I dialed volume down and drove the unit to 2 volt input to get this:As we see, its modern competitors all have tons more power.The digital input though does better as we see in this IMD comparison:If the PMA-50 had more power, it would be a real contender here.Signal to noise ratio using USB input at nearly 5 watts and max power yielded this:We barely miss the spec at max power.  Even at 5 watt though, we are reasonably close to noise floor of CD/16-bit audio.  So not bad.ConclusionsThe Denon PMA-50 seems to be competently designed.  It has none of the performance quirks of cheap class-D amps.  It has a solid cabinet and controls to go with that engineering.The big knock against it is modest amount of power and high price relative to competition.  And in this day and age, lack of streaming support.I personally put huge value on power in amplifiers so can\\'t recommend the PMA-50 on that front.  But you have the data and can judge for yourself with your priorities.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.The weather has warmed up and we are having a glorious, dry spring which is unusual for us.  The panthers have noticed the same and have been pestering me for a picnic lunch.  They may seem small in pictures but they have voracious appetite so I need money for food and drinks for them.

       " \" Marantz PM-90 Vintage stereo integrated amplifier.  It was purchased by a member from japan and drop shipped to me for testing.  It came out in 1991 with a price of 160,000 Yen  .  I looked online and I can only find one for US $950 but it is more beat up than this unit.I must say, this is one nice looking amplifier with a look that would fit in even today:The feel of the controls is excellent other than volume control which I found a bit loose.  A flip down door gives you additional control including switching between Class AB and Class A mode of operation!  Sadly it requires the unit to be powered down to change so no opportunity for instant switching and comparison.I was pleasantly surprised to see modern, beefy speaker terminals as well:Even more interesting is the inclusion of XLR balanced inputs for CD.This amplifier is back breakingly heavy due to use of two massive transformers.  It is at the limit of what I could lift and carry up two flight of stairs for testing.  Sitting here, my back aches just thinking about the reverse trip to pack the darn thing!  Speaking of packing, it was immaculately double boxed by Hifi-Do with zero impact to it despite the long journey.  Apparently it even came with one year warranty although you have to ship it back to Japan for that.Speaking of Japan, the unit is made for that market and hence 100 volt rating as opposed to 120 volts we have here in US.  If it were mine, I would go ahead and use it at 120 but being that of someone else's and hard to replace, I powered it by both my Lab AC generator and a Variac set to 100 volts.  This may have caused some measurement issues as I noted below.Marantz PM-90 Amplifier MeasurementsThere is a lot here to test due to dual mode of operation and dual type of input.  Let's start with Class A operation with RCA and then XLR:Unfortunately our measurements are polluted by high mains noise and harmonics.  I tried every which way but could not reduce that impact much.  Whether this is due design of the amplifier or longer AC mains connection due to use of lab AC gen or Variac, I can't tell.  As is SINAD doesn't appear to be better than modern AVRs with Marantz on their front plate:However, if we look at the FFT, we see only two harmonics and then it disappears into noise.  Here is the performance of Marantz SR7015 as a reference:Noise from power supply is lower there which aids it in getting similar SINAD.Switching to Class AB mode has no penalty:If anything distortion harmonics go a bit lower although that was not reliable.To see if there is a difference at all between Class AB and Class A, I turned on the residual mode of Audio Precision in the scope display.  This shows us the difference between input and output waveforms.  If there is zero crossing error due to class AB operation, we should see more difference around that part of the waveform but we don't:What is there is mostly power supply noise.  I changed frequencies, power level down to 1 watt and still saw nothing that would correlate with zero crossing distortion which class A is supposed to solve.  Feedback and class AB operation seem to have cured that ailment leaving little room for Class A to do better.Here is the comparison between Class AB and Class A again with respect to signal to noise ratio:Class AB pulls ahead in full power mode because it can create more power.  At baseline 5 watts they are similar likely limited by power supply noise.Crosstalk showed a tiny improvement in favor of class A but it is not material:Bandwidth is good but not exceptional:Notice how amplifier gain changes as you switch modes so for any listening tests, you may have to compensate for that.Class AB of course has tons more power:Overall shape of the graph is average.  Wanting to see the impact of the pre-amp vs power amp, I separated the two and fed the unit with my analyzer direct using RCA:As expected, my analyzer is cleaner but impact is on distortion, not noise which is a bit surprising.  As is one channel being worse than the other.   SINAD reaches almost 100 dB now near full power, good channel, which is very nice.There is a lot of headroom when using class AB vs Class A:Testing amplifier linearity vs frequency we get:Class A power limits more at 20 Hz than Class AB.  Both show very predictable and smooth responses which is great.Multitone tests shows slightly lower distortion at higher frequencies in favor of Class A:Effectiveness of feedback lowers at higher frequencies and likely this is the reason class A does better there.Marantz PM-90 Phono Input MeasurementsIt was hard to  ure out a fair way to measure the performance of its phono stage to compare to stand-alone devices.  At first I used tape output but that didn't produce great response.  Best was from pre-amp tap to power amp:Sadly the mains noise is there and dwarfs SINAD.  There is no sign of harmonic distortion so that is very good.  Same situation exists for MC mode:RIAA equalization is probably the best I have measured:That story continues into headroom measurements:You get almost 12 volts of output before it starts to clip!  So pops and clicks should be much less noticeable.ConclusionsThe PM-90 does NOT show its age.  It produces above average performance compared to today's amplifiers.  It does so while running very cool and comfortable.  Not once did it get warm to touch or go into protection.  Push it hard and it just pulls back on the output but keeps going.  Clearly this is a very robust implementation.  Can it compete with state of the art amplification today in the form of Benchmark THX and Hypex/Purifi Class D amps?  No.  There is real innovation there to push down distortion and noise.  But we also have a lot of terrible amplifiers today which the PM-90 easily outperforms and does it with so much style.There is nothing to apologize for and a lot to praise for Marantz PM-90.  I hope the company goes back to these roots rather than horrible looks and performance of much of their AV line.On class A mode, I see no reason to recommend it and many reasons to avoid it.  If you run out of power there, you will certainly create audible distortion.  Whereas any benefit it might have is literally lost in the noise.I am happy to recommend the Marantz PM-90. \",\n",
       " \" XTZ A2-300 class D amplifier.      costs US $500 from the company direct  .  It is based on B&O ICE 300ASC or its newer name, 300A1.While you won't mistake the enclosure for A2-300 as a high-end, custom design, it has enough extra touches to set it above typical DIY type cases:There are some nice looking vents on the side.   Note however that all the heat is centralized in the center bottom panel as is typical of class D amp modules.  In use though, the bottom barely got warm although I could smell heat generation through side vents.I was disappointed to not see balanced inputs:The gain potentiometer will make the unit flexible but they are typically not good for reliability.  Since these controls don't get used often, then tend to go bad.  If you buy this unit, be sure to turn the control left and right once a few months.Binding posts are substantial which I liked.XTZ A2-300 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm:As noted, I adjusted the gain control to give me roughly 29 dB which is the standard value I use for my testing  .  Distortion is fairly low at -98 dB or so but there is enough noise to cost you 10 dB and a bit more in the other channel.  This makes SINAD still above average:As noted, noise is somewhat an issue and we can see that in signal to noise ratio:Notice how one channel is 3.5 dB worse than the other.I was a bit disappointed to see frequency response being impacted by my simple resistive load, showing peaking around 20 kHz:More complex speaker loads may make this worse  .  Crosstalk is OK:Here is our power level versus distortion+noise at 4 ohm:We see the same noise differential here and some distortion differential as well  .  Power is way short of 300 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% which is what the spec calls for, we are still shy of that:So definitely not conservatively rated.8 ohm load naturally produces a lot less power:Typical of ICE modules, they don't behave evenly across the frequency range:That is quite a variation in distortion and noise relative to power.  In some sense then our previous tests using 1 kHz are not as representative of the total performance.ConclusionsI started the review liking the enclosure.  But then got a bit more jaded with unbalanced only inputs, and higher than expected noise level, high frequency dependency on both frequency response and distortion+noise. Then again, performance is still above average compared to many amplifiers I have tested.  This produced a quandary for me.  I could recommend it and justify it.   At the end, I decided to not recommend it but without strong feelings one way or the other.  You have the data to decide for yourself. -\",\n",
       " ' NAD C268 power amplifier with balanced inputs.  It is kindly sent to me by   costs US $900 at NAD dealers  .  The C268 is built on Hypex UcD Class D amplifier modules so in testing it we will get coverage on that as well.  Then again NAD says it is a custom version for them.The front panel looks good and substantial:The unit is nice and light to move around and inside has fair amount of space.  Back panel is nice in the way it provides both balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA input together with gain control:For my testing I used the fixed gain mode to get around any channel differential the potentiometers may introduce.Speaker terminals are nice and easy to use and naturally the unit is properly certified for safety and emissions.  Keep the later in mind as you compare it with any DIY version of the same amplifier modules.  With anything with mains input, I highly recommend sticking with products with safety certifications.In use, the amplifier runs completely cool to touch.  Not even above room temperature it seems.  It never, ever shut down no matter what I did to it.  This is one of the reasons you buy a separate amplifier by the way.  These power amplifiers are far more robust than any in any home theater AVR.Stereo Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard where we feed the amplifier a simple 1 kHz sine wave/tone and ask it to produce 5 watts into 4 ohm load  .  This is what we get:For some reason the channel in blue has much more second harmonic causing its SINAD -- which is a sum of distortion and noise -- to suffer by 5 dB.  There is always some differential between stereo channels but this is a bit much.  This aside, performance is above average with a SINAD of 87 dB once averaged  :Covering the basics, frequency response is very good:Crosstalk   shape is unusual but fortunately it gives is near state-of-the-art performance where our hearing   is most sensitive:Noise performance is very good  :You easily clear the CD/streaming content\\'s 16 bit dynamic range at almost any listening level.Getting fancy and using 32-tones to test for distortion/intermodulation we get what we already seen from the dashboard which is good:A power amplifier\\'s job is well, to produce power so let\\'s measure that starting with 4 ohm load:NAD rates the amplifier at 80 watts for both 4 and 8 ohm loads which is unusual.  Fortunately we are beating that with our 4 ohm load, getting 96 watts.As noted earlier, noise performance is very good as indicated by how low the red graphs are until distortion sets in and the graph starts to flatten and rise.  But then we hit a very hard wall at the end.  This is an amp that will sound good until it doesn\\'t.  You will instantly know its power limit for good or bad.There is some hidden good news here though.  Let\\'s measure power at 1% distortion+noise both continuous   and burst:Wow, many switching amplifiers don\\'t produce much more power in burst mode.  Here, we are getting more than double the power to the tune of 230 watts while both channels driven!  This means for momentary musical peaks, you have much more power available than our standard non-burst tests show.Switching to 8 ohms we get what the company advertises:All of these power tests are at just one frequency: 1 kHz.  Let\\'s now run the same power sweep into 4 ohm load but vary the frequency:With class D amps, I expect these lines to have many different shapes and be all of the place.  Instead, they land right on top of each other which is an ideal response.  If you look to the right before clipping occurs though, you see that at the two ends of the spectrum -- 20 and 20,000 Hz -- power does get limited.  20 kHz doesn\\'t need much power as music spectrum is quite low.  But 20 Hz does and loss of power is unfortunate but very common.  The peaks at low frequencies last a while due to their slow \"speed\"   which taxes the power supply causing it to run out of juice at lower power levels.Amplifier Bridged Mode PerformanceI usually don\\'t test bridged mode but knowing you rascals, you will immediately ask for it since NAD emphasizes this a lot.  So let\\'s recon ure the amp into a single channel and see what we get:Company advertises 300 watts but that is likely at higher distortion than what I use in the above graph.  To approximate their performance, let\\'s use the 1% THD+N threshold again and measure again:Now we get the 300 watts continuous.  And better yet, we get close to half a kilowatt of power for peaks!  Nicely done.ConclusionsThe value proposition of the NAD C268 amplifier doesn\\'t look very good at first blush.  Just 80 watts per channel for $900?  Testing shows while that is more or less the continuous power level, for short duration the amplifier can provide far more power.  Combined with the nice and safe build quality, the C268 won my heart.As such, I am going to put the NAD C268 on my recommended list. ',\n",
       " ' NAD M10 streaming amplifier and DAC.  It was purchased and drop shipped to me kindly by a member.  It costs US $2,749 from NAD dealers.The M10 sports a very large touch screen LCD display that covers the entire front face:Sorry for leaving the protecting plastic on.  Like to keep things as new as possible for members.As nice as the display is, it simply is not as responsive as your phone or tablet.  What could be really cool such as the VU meter mode, becomes a jittery display that doesn\\'t please much.  A much faster processor with GPU would be needed to really make the display the star.  Still, it is heads and shoulders above others that have small displays.The back panel is notable for inclusion of HDMI ARC input:Alas, I have no ARC capability on my workstation so could not test that feature.In normal use the plastic case barely gets warm.  Under heavy stress of power testing, it got somewhat warm making me wish the case was made out of aluminum than plastic.  You are not likely to push the switching amplifiers this hard and at any rate, the M10 runs much cooler than any Audio/Video Receiver.While I did not have time to test it, the M10 comes with Dirac Room EQ which is nice.I noticed one operational/design issue.  I unplugged the unit to take its picture but noticed that the display went crazy flashing random stuff.  I thought it was a capacitor that was discharging but this continued and would not stop!  I looked in the back and I realized I still had the HDMI cable plugged in.  Knowing that it provides a 5 volt \"hot plug\" signal, I disconnected it and the display finally shut down.  This is improper design.  The device must NOT draw any power out of HDMI connection.DAC Audio MeasurementsI connected the Coax output of my Audio Precision APx555 analyzer to the M10 and measured what came out of the pre-out with volume adjusted for 2 volt output:Distortion is quite low at -110 dB   but the noise floor kept jumping up and down causing SINAD to vary with it.  This shows lack of isolation between sensitive DAC subsystem and busy processor running other functions of the device.  As it is, performance is respectable which is a sigh of relief:Anything in green and blue is good.Testing at other output levels shows that the M10 is capable of pumping out good bit of voltage:Dynamic range clears the bar for 16 bit CD/streaming content but not much more:IMD distortion versus level shows the same noise issue:Filter response also shows higher than it should be noise floor:Jitter and noise test shows a lot of unwanted tones but audibly they are below threshold of hearing:Linearity is very good:EDIT: forgot to include multitone in the original review:Finally, we see the penalty of the DAC filter not being sharp enough in distortion+noise versus frequency:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI was hoping that analog input was not digitized but alas, it is:And at very low sample rate.  Maybe there is a setting to change this but I did not bother to look.Using the same analog input, I witnessed wild swings in noise floor of the unit:So I abandoned the analog input and switched to Coax for the rest of the amplifier tests:Performance is improved and stable as well.  This rates the M10 above average for more than 100 amplifiers tested so far:Signal to noise ratio is disappointing as even with full power, it barely clears the 16 bit hurdle:Frequency response using digital input is wide enough:But for those people with ultra sensitive high frequency hearing, you will lose half a dB at 20 kHz.Let\\'s see how much clean power we get out of M10 starting with 4 ohm load:I allowed the distortion to go higher   and got even more power:I tried to get the burst power rating but some kind of limiter in the M10 was  hting the analyzer and wouldn\\'t allow me to get there.  It was nice that it would not shut down.Power naturally drops at 8 ohm:ConclusionsPerformance of the NAD M10 is generally acceptable especially for a multifunction device where we see a lot of fails.  Alas issues here and there took away my enthusiasm for it.  There is no excuse for poor analog input performance in a nearly $3000 device.  Or rather high and variable noise floor.So overall, I gave it a \"like it\" panther award but it is not something I would personally buy.  I can be stubborn that way! ',\n",
       " ' Teac AX-501 integrated power   amplifier. The AX-501 is part of the reference series from Teac so doesn\\'t come cheap as desktop products go.  I see the price at USD $999 on Amazon plus $35 shipping.  There is a discount for silver a USD $899 but Amazon doesn\\'t sell it for some reason.When I reviewed the Teac HA-501 Headphone Amplifier, I heaped praise over its modern retro look.  The AX-501 takes that to an entirely different level with addition of a couple of super cute, yellow background VU meters:What is that?  I should have took the shot with the VU meters working and the light turned on?  Well, the owner played a cruel joke on me by not supplying me with the remote and leaving the setting to off for the VU meter!!!  The controls are almost as nice of the HA-501 with the exception of the volume control which feels a bit stiff and has some slack in it.  Otherwise, there is nothing to fault it as far as I am concerned.Here is the back panel:XLR inputs should be mandatory in this price range and I am glad to see then included here  .  The AX-501 uses a class-D amplifier and runs as cool as you could get in my testing.  I don\\'t think it ever got even warm.  Class D also means light weight and that is NOT the case here. The AX-501 is a very hefty unit for its size.  This means it stays put no matter how heavy your cables are.Notice the lawyers getting their hands on the unit as to indicate the class of speaker wiring you are supposed to use!  But hey, it is good to know the unit has been through corporate filter of certification and regulation.Even though Teac is a Japanese company, the AX-501 is made in China.Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard view using XLR inputs:Even though Teac specs the AX-501 at 1 watt, we see the same performance at 5 watts which is nice. Distortion and noise as stated in SINAD dB puts the AX-501 above average  :It loses to SONOS Amp using its digital input and ever so slightly outperforms the Amazon Link Amp.Signal to noise ratio matches company spec:Frequency response shows identical output for both channels which is a relief as poorly made class-D amps differ in this regard:Roll off is early for my taste.  I like to see flat response to 40  kHz. That said, early filtering seems to help bring stability to performance of the low cost class D amps and I saw that here as I measured power output:There is a broad operating range where performance is good between 1 and 30 watts.  We then run out of juice and clipping occurs at 88 watts.  Rated output is 100 watts although higher resolution measurement may have gotten us closer.The Amazon Link Amp has more power and SONOS even more.  You are guaranteed to hear distortion when an amp reaches its max power rating so on this all important metric, the Teac AX-501 loses to its cheaper rivals.  And of course we are worlds away compared to reference amps like those based on Hypex NC-400.I have added a new test to my power amplifier suite and that is intermodulation distortion relative to measured power.  I ran it against the recently reviewed Klipsch PowerGate Amplifier: We see more evidence of the stability and clean performance of Teac AX-501 as switched/class D amplifiers go.  The IMD graph is also more revealing of distortion set it around 7 to 8 watts and climbing before final clipping.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI ran a sampling of my headphone tests starting with power versus distortion using 300 ohm load:Wow, this is impressive amount of output power at such a high impedance.  I wonder if we are just looking at the output of the power amplifier, reduced with an in-line resistor.  Here is the results with 33 ohm load:Oh, this is not nearly as good.  The reason is this:Sadly, we have a high value resistor in series with the output to the tune of 58 ohm.  I don\\'t like to see a value much more than 10 ohm and ideally, down to 1 to 2 ohm.Best use would be high impedance headphone with relatively flat impedance graph versus frequency.  Otherwise some \"color\" will be imparted on the sound  .ConclusionsPersonally I think Teac has nailed the look and feel of such a desktop product.  The AX-501 is in an entirely different class, rivalling Nagra when it comes to switch-gear and meters.  In that regard it is a \"bargain.\"The power amplifier seems competent without hairy corner cases.  It is above average in performance but not rising up to the levels I like to see for $1,000.  As I noted in the review. power is everything and there are much better choices in that regard such as SONOS Amp.  At nearly half the price, it delivers more than twice the power plus a bunch of other features such as included streaming/DAC.  It doesn\\'t look nearly as nice as Teac AX-501 though.The headphone output is a checklist item although it should sound very good with high impedance headphones  .The AX-501 runs cool and should be quite reliable and safe giving its pedigree.  Overall I \\'like\" the Teac AX-501 but can\\'t recommend it on performance or value.  We should be able to do better for $1,000 so the search continues. -',\n",
       " ' Lexicon, first generation DD8, 8-channel amplifier.  It was purchased used by   drop shipped to me.  The DD8 came from collaboration of Harman with TI   to produce very low weight, switching amplifiers for BMW car audio system.  It was then later repurposed in this con uration for the Custom Integration   industry.  It is actually rebranded by a number of companies and sold under their label. Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman products which includes Lexicon.  So keep potential bias in mind as you read this review.All 8 channels are provided in one compact, very cool running 1U rack mount chassis:A stout on off switch manages power duties together with heftiest relay sound you have heard!  The back will seem unusual for hi-fi market but is precisely what the custom integration channel needs:You can either feed the unit individually per channel or a \"bus\" input that feeds the same stereo input to all the channels.  The latter is very handy for \"whole house audio\" where the same music plays in every room from ceiling speakers and such.  A looped bus output is provided to cascade more of these units.Output is provided through phoenix connectors which again is common and desired in CI channel as they are secure but small connectors.  Individual gain controls are provided for every channel.  You can also select mono vs stereo  .  And auto-sensing for channels not used.  Trigger is also provided of course.The available units are pulled out of existing installs so likely have many hours on them.  And if the installer didn\\'t know what he was doing, it may have been subjected to high temps.  Indeed the first unit the owner bought did not work right, changing its gain with temperature.  I traced it to the front-end of the unit.  So know what you are getting if you buy them used.Brand new, second generation DD8s cost US $3,500  . This version listed for US $2,500.  I see them listed for $1,300 right now on ebay but I believe the owner was able to get it much cheaper.Lexicon DD8 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard.  I set the gain to max which nicely gave me 29 dB which is what I have standardized on:This is above average performance with distortion kept below 100 dB;Noise performance is good as well:Ideally we would get 16 bits at 5 watts but 15 is a good effort.I was disappointed by the early cut off from the output filter:This is due to rather low switching frequency of 250 kHz  , which made the filter harder to design:Crosstalk is fine:Power into 4 ohm is rather low:The protection circuit was aggressive which made getting max and peak power difficult.  Still I managed to get some numbers:While we get more burst power courtesy of power supply designed for a lot more channels than two, max power with 1% THD+N still was rather low.I then tested the amp using 8 ohm and surprisingly, it produces more power there:To see how the power scales, I measured max power using two and four channels.  Both were the same using 8 ohm:Most disappointing was varying the frequency and producing a power sweep:As you see, there is huge penalty at higher frequencies.  Furthermore, there are power related linearities.ConclusionsIn mid to low frequencies, the DD8 produces well above average performance.  Above that frequency though, distortion increases substantially and other non-linearities surface.  Output seems to have some load dependency while also rolling off early.If you can get the unit for a few hundred dollars, then its compact enclosure and general performance may be a steal.  You could almost push me to recommend it but I am not going to.  I like to see better performance with respect to frequency response and high frequencies.   I think for its intended custom install market, it is perfect  .  For hi-fi use, you have to make that decision. -',\n",
       " ' Outlaw 2200 single-channel amplifier. The 2200 costs US $399 plus shipping although I read that it goes on sale for less than that.I was surprised how svelte the 2200 is given its power capability:The diminutive size comes from \"class G\" implementation which varies the power supply with signal.  This sharply lowers the power loss at lower power levels allowing the heatsinks to be much smaller.   Despite its low \"1U\" height, the 2200 is heavy though courtesy of a larger pancake toroidal power transformer.It is always great to see balanced XLR input and trigger capability on amplifiers:In use, the 2200 was solid as a rock.  It never shut down or complain and ran very cool even after full suite of tests.  I was worried about recommendation to stack these from Outlaw but after testing, I think that can be done without much concern.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:SINAD is supposed to be sum of distortion and noise relative to our input signal.  Here, distortion is very low, approaching -105 dB.  So the fact that the SINAD is just 86 dB tells us that the number is dominated by noise as you will see shortly.  As it is, this is above average for some 75 amplifiers tested so far:Here is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and full power:Frequency response is a bit more limited than I like to see:Measured power at both 4 and 8 ohms exceed outlaw specifications:Even more power is on tap if you allow higher distortion or for momentary peaks:Wideband spectrum analysis shows very clean output:Those of you who are bothered by class D switching noise, should be happy to see this.  Indeed I performed all of my tests without an ultrasonic filter on my Analyzer.Thermal StabilityPerformance was rock solid from cold to operating temp:ConclusionsThe Outlaw 2200 monoblocks provides solid performance, easily besting the amps you get in a typical home theater AVR and then some.  Its slim packaging allows you to con ure as many channels as you need without needing a lot of space.  Efficiency is good but doesn\\'t bring with it the light weight of the class D.  I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2200 amplifier. -',\n",
       " ' Niles SI-2150 Class D amplifier. He purchased it refurbished and I see it for sale at $367.  Original cost seems to be US $850.By using efficient Hypex UcD250LP class D amplifier modules, the SI-2150 manages to fit in a small, 1U rack chassis:Niles is targeting this amp as Custom Integration   channel so has good control as far as trigger and such:In use, the unit stayed cool and calm.  When pushed into clipping it will go into protection.  Sadly it stays in that mode until it is power cycled rather than recovering on its own.Nice set of gain controls are provided which lets you get precise channel matching -- something that is rarely the case in many amplifiers.  I set them to 29 dB for my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone dashboard into 4 ohm load:SINAD which is the ratio of distortion and noise versus signal is better than average at 85 dB:Signal to noise ratio ranks in the same region:Frequency response is flat enough in audible band:Power into 4 ohm shows good noise and distortion:Lots of power is available if we allow the distortion to rise to 1%:Response into 8 ohm load is rather odd:Usually we have a declining graph with hard clipping in solid state amplifiers, not this gradual rise in distortion.  As such, it was not easy to determine the clipping point as I normally do.Typical of class D amps, the relationship with frequency and power is complex:Removing my ultrasonic filter allows us to see the switching spectrum of the amplifier:ConclusionsI am not sure at the regular list price but at refurbished cost, this is a steal of an amplifier.  Lots of power in a cool, small enclosure with above average distortion and noise.I am going to put the Niles SI-2150 on my recommended list. -',\n",
       " \" Peachtree amp500 stereo amplifier.     costs US $1,499.The amp500 comes in the same packaging of many previous Peachtree products. I wish company would innovate here as the design looks kind of dated. Then again it is very unique.  This amplifier comes with balanced inputs which I very much like:When I pushed the amp, the protection circuit naturally kicked it but unlike many other amps, recovered automatically without the need for a power cycle.The back half of the box is empty so the amp module is small.  And there is plenty of ventilation on top.  There was only modest temperature rise in the case post all the testing I did which is admirable.Peachtree amp500 MeasurementsThe amplifier was ready on power up:Dashboard measurement shows above average performance:Noise+distortion as embodied in SINAD is well above median although well sort of state of the art:I could not come close to matching company spec for SNR:Frequency response was flat enough and not dependent on impedance which is very good for a class D amp:Crosstalk was state of the art so I am assuming some kind of dual mono con uration:Multitone was respectable:Let's see how power it pumps into a 500 watt load:That is a lot of power!  The clipping is quite sharp though which when combined with the protection circuit, would not allow me to measure max power.  But I did get peak power:I think spec is 700 watts but we are close enough.  Even at 8 ohm we have good bit of power:High frequencies bother the amp but go lower and linearity is excellent:Finally, we have a new test: power on noise:I haven't run this test on other amps to know if this is good or bad.  Once I do get some mileage on it, we will better know what is going on.  If I were to guess, I would say this is good performance.ConclusionsStory here is simple: tons and tons of power with above average noise and distortion.  A cool running switching amplifier in small package as well.  Really, nothing much to complain about here.I am going to recommend the Peachtree amp500. \",\n",
       " ' Outlaw 2220 single channel amplifier.     costs US $399.The look is simple but elegant in its slim form factor.  I like that it is just heavy enough to give you confidence but not so much that you can\\'t lift it.Nice set of features are provided from balanced XLR input to trigger.  A larger toroidal transformer indicates class class AB design  .Outlaw 2220 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm:I like the very low distortion spikes that are around -108 dB or so.  Some power supply noise   and general noise lower SINAD down to 85 dB which is still quite competent:Noise level could be a bit lower at 5 watts but still respectable:Multitone test shows the very low distortion of the amplifier:Frequency response is flat which is an improvement over the 2200 model which drooped at 20 kHz:The word \"monoblocks\" sets up expectations of high amount of power and the 2220 delivers:This should be plenty of power for just about any use.Finally we can examine performance at different frequencies:Some strange distortion mechanism sets in at highest frequencies but only during a limited power range  .  Fortunately you hardly ever have content at high frequencies at high amplitude so not an audible concern.ConclusionsPerformance of the Outlaw 2220 is solid, solid, solid!  What can I say.  It delivers what you expect with nary any results that raise an eyebrow sans that high frequency distortion.  You have ton of power which should be handy for both stereo music listening and home theater.  At $399 it brings great value as well.I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2220 monoblock amplifier.

       " ' all-in-one Marantz HD-AMP1 DAC and integrated amplifier.      retails for USD $1,100 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.The unit has a somewhat retro looking of other Marantz audio products with the round digital display and wood sides:There are both digital inputs and analog allowing one to build a complete system around the HD-AMP1.  I was surprised to not see RCA outputs though so no convenient way to use its internal DAC by itself.Amplification is through class-D technology which allowed the unit to run cool.  Without permission from its owner though, I did not put it through thermal stress.In addition to speaker output, there is also a headphone jack so   output through that too.There is a lot of functionality in HD-AMP1.  I chose to test a few of them in this feature and will test more based on requests.MeasurementsI started by testing the DAC+headphone stage using our usual dashboard:As you see, I set the output to 2 volt which is the nominal output of stand-alone DACs.  Alas, performance is nothing to write home about.  Second harmonic distortion is quite high, setting the SINAD at just 85 dB.  This would put in the fourth quadrant of DACs tested  .  We also have fair bit of harmonic spikes from the power supply from 180 Hz and up  .Loading down the headphone output with 300 ohm, we get this:There are internal gain settings but I did not mess with them.  As it is, level of noise and distortion is quite high relative to desktop DAC+amp products.  Power output however is decent.Switching to the power amplifier, here is the power versus distortion+noise measurement:I have plotted three graphs using three different volume controls with input being swept up to 2 volts.  Distortion climbs less steeply than other amps so hard to know where to stop and measure the wattage.  I selected a conservative point and got 47 watts.  I believe the rating from Marantz is 70 watts using my 4 ohm load.    You could certainly get there and beyond if you tolerate more distortion.As I have noted, the performance is similar to budget amplifiers like NuForce STA-200   but not even remotely getting close to our best in class Hypex NC400 amplifier  .  Best case performance is about SINAD of 72 dB or so.Above is with my 40 kHz AES-17 filter by the way.Frequency response was very good for a class D amplifier:And here is the broadband spectrum analysis of a 1 kHz tone:The first large spike comes at nearly 500 kHz which I am assuming is the switching frequency of its class-D amplifier.  Its second harmonic is at nearly 1 Mhz and down -60 dB.Finally, here is the harmonic distortion+noise versus frequency at 5 watts of output using 90 kHz of bandwidth:Once again, it is not on the same planet as the Hypex NC400.  It also has instability when the analyzer switches its frequency as indicated by the \"T\" symbols.  It takes some 5 seconds for the readings to become stable.  We saw this in the Behringer A500 amplifier review.ConclusionsI wanted to like the Marantz HD-AMP1.  It has been in demand for quite a while on the forum to measure it. Having done that, I see no signs of excellence. It follows the drifting backward industry trend of \"good enough\" performance specs.  This is reflected in lack of hardly any specifications provided by Marantz.  On feature side, it is very strange that there is no RCA outputs to use the DAC and pre-amp with a different power amplifier.Needless to say, I can\\'t recommend the Marantz HD-AMP1. -',\n",
       " 'This is a follow up to my first test of the Cambridge Audio CXA81.  Results there showed fair bit of noise which was uncharacteristic of other products I have tested from the company.  There were a lot of speculation as to the source of the problem but no data to back any. Fortunately company CEO was kind enough to contact me about a week later expressing surprised at my results. I asked them if they have measurements that are better.  After some investigation, they said that they could replicate my results at their China manufacturing facility but not their R&D lab. I expressed that I no longer had the unit so there was not any work I could do to get to the bottom of this.  I was offered a new unit and offer for payment to test again. I accepted the second unit but turn down the offer of payment.In the communication, I was asked   whether I lifted the USB ground using the switch in the back.  I had not and ran those tests on the second unit.  This is with the unit grounded:The low frequency noise was much lower in this sample but you can still see the channel in red showing a wide spectrum of high frequency noise.  This reduced its sinad fair bit compared to the \"good\" channel.  Lifting the ground made that better but created a new problem:At first it appears that there is more harmonic distortion given the spikes at 2, 3,4, 5, etc. KHz.  But that is not so.  USB micro packets are 1 Kbytes each and frame boundaries are showing up there as leakage from digital to analog circuits.  So lifting the ground is really not a good solution here although I appreciate it being there as it may help some systems.Post this we had a conference call with the designers of the product.  Issue was brought up that this is an instrumentation thing that the Audio Precision analyzer is creating a loop and ground noise that would not be there.  While this is true, I explained that I have tested hundreds of DACs that don\\'t have this problem.  I have once in a while seen this but it is exceptionally rare.  Since overall results were more positive than the first sample, I offered to re-run all the measurements and post them.A problem which we did NOT have a disagreement was, was the output limit of the pre-out.  Like many AVRs, this is lower than I like to see at 1.5 volt.  Above that it will saturate and distortion will increase.With this intro, let\\'s get into the measurements.  Company has seen all the measurements and agrees with them.CXA81 DAC Measurements  I wanted to break the electrical link between the analyzer and CXA81 so started my DAC testing using Toslink optical. Here is our dashboard:Note how I have picked the max output before output saturating.  If we sweep the input level we see the full range of output relative to distortion:As you see at 2 volts, we get down to SINAD of 75 dB which is what I measured with the first sample at that output.I next switched to USB input:We see noise intrusion reducing SINAD by a few dBs relative to TOSLINK optical.  Here is a key discovery though: this is NOT due to USB input but mere connection of USB cable.  You can see that noise even with Toslink when I have USB plugged in  :Turns out this noise issue will proceed to corrupt the measurements of all other subsystems and was the reason why the amplifier for example did not perform well either in the first round.  The impact with this second unit is lower than first sample though.  This could be due to noise conditions changing on my test system   or something is different in the second sample.To eliminate USB noise as a factor I continued the rest of DAC tests using Toslink so let\\'s go through them quickly:Linearity test was impacted by another rare issue which is power supply noise very close to the test tone of 200 Hz I use here.  There is a strong bandpass filter here but not enough to get rid of that:We see clear jitter sources but they are benign audibly:IMD test shows more noise than I like to see but is very good at the limit, beating my reference DAC in blue:Here is our reconstruction filter:And THD+N vs frequency:Pre-amp MeasurementsHere again we see the impact of connecting the USB cable or not while testing analog in/analog out:Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard:This is above average for all amplifiers tested to date and far better than noise-induced measurements of the first sample.  Distortion is at -100 dB which is very good.Power sweeps are much improved due to lower noise:We see that in various frequencies as well:The lower amount of noise allows distinction between the test tones.ConclusionsThe second sample combined with not connecting USB cable shows CXA81 in much better light.  Performance is competent now for the class and transparent for most uses.  Where would one put the blame for noise being induced using USB?  Me? Instrumentation? Vagueness of computer audio/grounding?  Some or all of the above?  When testing AVRs, I have started testing with Toslink to remove issues related to HDMI.  I should have opted to do the same here but did not since I consider the unit in a different class.  Still, I take some blame and should have done this before returning the unit. As I expressed to the company though, this is not a problem that other devices have so I implore them to investigate how to use this variability. After all, your system may be much worse than my con uration as your downstream devices and upstream computer may present even a worse situation. One likes to take comfort in thinking \"one digital input is the same as another.\"As it is, you have the tough situation that you can\\'t leave USB cable connected lest you degrade the performance of the rest of the system.  If you don\\'t have an audible issue, this is not a concern but if it is, experiment with removing USB cable and see if fixes the problem.For me personally, USB connection is critical and about the only input I would use on such a combo device.  So the above is not something that works for me.  But may be fine for you.I also like to see output levels of 2 volts for unbalanced without saturating.  We are seeing AVR/AVP companies going this way.  No reason to do different in a combo device like this.  Higher output level gives better freedom to use external amplifiers.Finally, let me express my sincere and deep appreciate for Cambridge Audio and company CEO for accepting the challenging results of the first test and working with me on better clarity and a constructive path forward.  In that regard, they earn highest levels of respect from me.  I look forward to quality products from them that come across my bench.',\n",
       " ' Allo Volt+ D class D amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by   costs US $129 in this \"dual mono\" con uration with stepped attenuator.I am not a big fan of these clear cases but in this case, pun intended, it works!Hard to take a picture of it though without heavily accentuating dust and such that normally is not visible:Dual TI TPA2116 class D amplifiers are used plus a front-end switching power supplies to generate the required plus and minus supplies.Not that no power supply comes with this amplifier.  You have a choice of what you put in there.  I used my lab power supply at its max setting of 31 volts and 3 amps.  It could use more than 3 amps with 4 ohm load as the power supply current limited near max power sweeps.  It was fine with 8 ohm load though as that doesn\\'t need as much current.There is no remote control so this is really a desktop amplifier.  There is a gain switch below that switches between 19 and 26 dB.  I used the default 19 dB which works well with desktop DACs that have no trouble producing near 2 volts you need for max power.Overall the Volt+ D makes a very positive impression with respect to looks and build quality.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is nice!  Budget class D amps routinely produce SINAD in 55 to 65 dB and here we are well above that at 84 dB:I was also impressed with how low the noise floor was at 5 watt playback:Many amplifiers fail to achieve 96 dB which is my target for this level of playback.Crosstalk is superb, better than just about any amp I have tested recently:Frequency response has a tiny bit of roll off at 20 kHz:As I noted in the introduction, with 4 ohm load my power supply lacks enough current so I also tested with one channel driven:So it seems that getting the 60 watt advertised power level is possible.Taking advantage of onboard capacitors, I ran my burst test:So even in stereo you have over 60 watts, going to nearly 90 watts with one channel.Power into 8 ohm load is naturally lower:Notice that noise floor is very low contributing to very good response at lower power levels.Varying the frequency gives us the following power levels and distortion:At or below 1 kHz response is excellent and frequency independent.  Above that it varies which is typical of many class D amps.Finally, I ran a spectrum analysis without my usual class D amp filter in the path:Wow, TI put some clever filtering/design in there.  Usually the switching frequency is down just 10 to 2 dB from our main tone.  Here, nothing rises above -88 dB or so!  TI advertises that the amp will not interfere with AM radio and it definitely won\\'t.ConclusionsThe Allo Volt+ D amplifier is a delightful surprise.  Careful design has elevated the performance of these switching \"chip amplifiers\" to that of mass market hifi/class AB designs.  Yet, it runs cool and costs very little.  Yes, you need an external power supply and that is the only flaw I see with going with this solution.  Overall, I am happy to recommend the Allo Volt+ D for its nice and elegant design and performance especially at this price. -',\n",
       " \"  of Amazon Echo Link Amp power amplifier, DAC and network streamer.  I purchased this from Amazon for USD $299 and it arrived yesterday.While rather featureless from front, the overall feel of the plastic and case is quite good:When you rotate the volume control white LEDs light up to show a coarse volume control.  They time out very quickly though so I could not capture them on the camera.Not sure what the hole is for.  Maybe it is for a remote control but none was provided.The back panel is the more interesting bit:In addition to the power amplifier, we have a nice little DAC and pre-amplifier here.  There are digital inputs in the form of both Coax and Toslink S/PDIF.  And of course we also have streaming capability with the Ethernet jack and wifi.  Surprisingly we also have S/PDIF and Toslink output for digital connectivity to other DACs and amplifiers.There is analog input and output.  Former can be used for your analog gear and the latter, for use as a DAC or pre-amp.  There are issues with this mode though.  See later in measurement section.Operationally the Link Amp runs very cool.  However at higher power there is an audible mechanical hissing sound likely caused by resonance of an internal inductor.  It was audible to me from 3 feet away without use of speakers  .As you can imagine for a product with Amazon name of it, there is a professional looking label underneath with every regulatory and safety certification you would want to see.  This is important as the Link Amp like many other power amplifiers is mains operated with a lot of high power circuits.  Oddly there is no power button.Sadly there is hardly any documentation provided with the unit.  You are supposed to seek help in the Alexa app.  I naively assumed that connecting ethernet cable would mean the Link Amp wout get instantly recognized by the app but such was not the case.  I had to con ure it using Wifi with the mess that is: connecting to local ad-hoc wifi it creates and then using the main home network.  Process was quite non-intuitive and took multiple reboots of phone and link amp to get it to finally recognize it.  Boy, do I miss the simplicity of the original echo.  Oddly, Alexa app provides no control over inputs!  I just fed it S/PDIF and it output that. Ditto for analog.  Can't tell what priority it will use if both are active.There is a volume control in the app but it only controls local/streaming content, not the volume control on the Amp.  Really?  The volume control is digital so why can't I control it in the app???Amazon has really lost its way here with respect to software here.  Added complexity over time has not been managed.Also at fault is the computer and networking industry that has not invented a new revision of Wifi standard that just works with devices like this.Overall, my impression of hardware is positive and software negative.Anyway, let's get into measurements.  With so much functionality here, I have chosen a subset to test, mostly focusing on the amplifier performance.DAC MeasurementsI was happy to see line out so thought we can check the performance of the DAC this way.  Alas, this was not meant to be as without a load, the amplifier shuts down when you turn up the volume to max to get the nominal voltage you like to see on a DAC.  There should be a software option to turn off the power amp so it doesn't do that.  So I had to connect my dummy loads to the amp to test it.  Here is the outcome:The power amplifier reduced performance by about 5 dB. SINAD was 92 dB or so without the load.  The current values put the Link Amp in the lower tier of DACs tested:It would have gone into a tier higher if I didn't have to run the power amplifier along with it.Here is the DAC frequency response which was promoted by later test results:The 44.1 kHz sampling results are fine.  What is not fine is that no matter what other sample rate you use, you get the same bandwidth!  In other words, while higher sample rates are accepted, everything seems to be down sampled to 44.1 or 48 kHz.  So forget any dreams you have of high resolution audio.Power Amplifier MeasurementsImportant note before we get into this section: during testing the results were a complete mess at lower frequencies.  The graphs were literally not readable with very high variations of THD+N.  So I spent a few hours with my son working through it and turned out some of these class-D amps cause frequency modulation at low frequencies which throws off the analyzer notch filter.  The result was that THD+N would go from correct value to 20%+ which would totally screw things up on the graph.  I found a good work-around for this which made the measurements look a lot nicer.  Alas, this means you can't quite compare these results to previous measurements where this issue was visible.  Fortunately we had very clean amplifiers such as Hypex NC400 without this issue so those results stand.Let's start with power amplifier dashboard st 5 watts using digital input:When   SONOS Amp there was a lot of degradation with analog input so let's test that:Ah, a sigh of relief.  Performance actually improves a bit using analog in!  Noise floor is flatter and lower although not enough to make the SINAD any different.  Putting that value in context of other power amplifiers tested, we get this:I updated this graph with the digital input of SONOS which nicely outperforms the Link Amp.  However, as noted with analog input the Amazon Link Amp is much better.Frequency response with digital input shows the same bandwidth limitation that the DAC did:Same test with analog input shows a droop at low frequencies as well:Note that even when using analog input, you are limited to the same 24 kHz bandwidth!  Someone didn't want you to mess with high resolution audio no matter what.  That aside, there is now a low frequency roll off too.Here is the signal to noise ratio:Let's deal with the most important test: power output versus distortion and noise:Compared to other budget amps like the $199 Topping TP60, there is much more power here and at lower noise and distortion.  Don't like one channel having more distortion though.A more direct competitor is the SONOS amp which costs twice as much but otherwise has streaming functionality:The Link Amp has better noise level but that is because SONOS has poor performance with its analog input.  The SONOS has tons more power and its two channels are staying in synch.  So the SONOS is a better deal here putting the cost aside.  Of course neither comes remotely close to our reference Hypex NC400 DIY build  .There has been some interest in running jitter tests on these power amplifiers.  So here is a snapshot of that:The THD+N versus level and frequency where my new tests show much cleaner results:Note that I have limited the bandwidth to 61 kHz. That is enough to capture the third harmonic of 20 kHz but low enough to keep the ultrasonic noise that these amps have.  I will show that in a bit.  Here we see that distortion rises with low and high frequencies.  The curve though matches how our hearing works in that we are much less sensitive in low and high frequencies so the distortion products are likely not audibly a problem.  Note then that testing at 1 khz shows the best case scenario for these class D amplifiers.I have another variation of above where I sweep the level/power and keep the frequency the same:We see that at 20,000 Hz, the two channels perform the same.  But as soon as we lower the test to 2,000 Hz and then 200 Hz, one channel gets a lot worse. This tells me there is insufficient power supply capacitor reserve for one channel than for the other.  The lower frequencies are more taxing this way because they stay at their extreme peaks of the sine wave longer.Lastly, here is our ultrasonic spectrum of a 1 kHz tone:We see our sharp spike around 600 kHz indicating that is the switching frequency.  The rise in ultrasonics around 100 khz shows noise shaping  .  Levels for these are quite low as class-D amps go, showing good attention to filtering, no doubt helped with the limited bandwidth of 24 kHz.ConclusionsMechanically and from safety and emissions point of view, Amazon Echo Link amp delivers for just $299.  This puts it way ahead of many offerings in this price range which are more akin to DIY efforts than a polished product.  On top of that, you have streaming, DAC and a digital and analog pre-amplifier.  This is a lot and I suspect Amazon is losing money on each one or barely breaking even.While some attention has been paid to produce a performant product, there are clear limitations and issues here and there.  Limiting of the bandwidth to 24 khz in all modes is a miss objectively but not subjectively.  As with other class D amps, we have odd behavior here and there such as rise in low frequency distortion, ultrasonic noise.The mechanical whistling while the amp is pushed should have been caught and fixed although in practice, the music should mask that well.At $299 with so many features and generally good performance, I am going to go ahead and put the Amazon Echo Link Amp on my recommended list.  No, it is no audiophile find.  But for secondary use its performance is good enough to make it a good buy. -\",\n",

Ditto on the back side:The claim to fame of this amplifier is use of GaN transistors which in theory simplify the design of a class D amplifier   and improve its efficiency  .  And in theory, it can also produce lower distortion  .  The drawback is much higher cost of the transistors compared to MOSFETs.  Let's see if the performance is there.Peachtree GAN400 MeasurementsI performed all of my testing using XLR input.  Let's start with our usual input of 1 kHz with output into 4 ohm to the tune of 5 watts:There is fair bit of inconsistency between the channels with respect to SINAD.  I switched my loads and issue persisted so it is not my setup.  Averaging the two we get 84 dB which is slightly average for all amps tested but not where performance should be:Frequency response is disappointing as it shows load dependency:This means that the high frequency response will be speaker dependent which is not good.  I expect this kind of performance in ultra budget amplifiers  , not at this price.Noise performance is good but again, not where it should be:Same for multitone distortion:Crosstalk however, is superb indicating two independent amplifiers:There is lots of power both at 4 and 8 ohms:As noted though, the curve starts to go up prior to clipping which means distortion is increasing.The amplifier more than meets its 400 watt spec at 1% THD:The shape of THD+N graph is very smooth which perhaps could be attributed to GaN transistor design:There is no pop on power up but there is when you shut it down:The amp is stable on power up so no need to leave it on:Peachtree GAN400 Power Stress TestWith the owner's permission , I subjected the amp to varying load angle   and down to 2 ohm impedance.  It did very well:Variations of ±60 degrees did not bother it at all at either 4 or 8 ohm.  A bit strangely, at 2 ohm it would not run with 0 load angle but did produce half the output at other angles  .  Since minimum impedance is 2.5 oh, we can't fault it for this.  FYI I tested a couple of amps at my disposal and the both got quite unhappy with varying phase angles, shutting down and such.  Whereas the GAN400 marched through this test without once going into protection.ConclusionsI just bought a 65 watt GaN based USB-C charger and am amazed at how small it is.  The buzz from there has travelled to audio and has resulted in GaN based amps like this Peachtree.  Alas, there is no performance advantage that can be seen in this implementation.  Noise+Distortion is only slightly better than average and far cry from top performing amplifiers we have tested in the past.  Combine this with quite high price of $2,500 and this is a difficult offer to swallow.  Good news is that there is plenty of power at 400+ watts independent of the load  .Personally I don't see a reason to pay so much for this level of performance so I can't recommend the Peachtree GAN400 amplifier. \",\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A07 Pro stereo amplifier.   costs about $90.As you see the distinguishing factor from some of the other Aiyima amplifiers is inclusion of tone controls. Alas, that is also where the problem is with this unit: there is no detent and no way of setting its response to flat. Worse yet small changes in the dials will make large differences in tonality. So while I like having toner controls, I definitely like to see a tone defeat feature.  Otherwise the unit feels nice to use and operate.  As is typical, the power supply is much larger than the amplifier itself:AIYIMA A07 Pro MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into a pure 4 ohm load, driven to stereo at 5 watts:We expect good performance from AIYIMA and we get it:Switching to my PowerCube Loadbox, we can simulate more complex loads:  As you see, performance is essentially the same.Noise performance is good enough for this class of budget amplifiers:Multitone shows good performance:Frequency response unfortunately is load   dependent:So you may be forced to use the treble control to adjust high frequency response for your speaker.Crosstalk is very good:Let's get into all important power measurements starting with 4 ohm:This is plenty for desktop use.  Switching to 8 ohm naturally robs us of fair amount of power:Fortunately vast majority of speakers on the market are 4 ohm nominal.To see stability of the amplifier, let's subject it to suite of loads and reactive components:An ideal amplifier would follow the red line.  We are essentially there for both 8 and 4 ohm.  Surprisingly this little amp managed to also keep running at 2 ohm, albeit without capacitive component and some power drop.  Many amps simply shut down and won't even work into 2 ohm.Edit: here is the response vs frequency that I forgot to post originally:Finally, here is the warm up profile:In use, the amplifier ran pretty cool.ConclusionsThe AIYIMA A07 Pro continues the tradition of the company providing competent levels of noise and distortion, good bit of power and very reasonable price.  While tone controls are a nice added feature, they lack a defeat switch.  And we have our usual load dependency.Personally I very much dislike the lack of tone control defeat so won't buy it.  But if that doesn't bother you, then the AIYIMA A07 Pro is another good bargain in stereo amplification. \",\n",
       " ' Peachtree Nova 300 integrated amplifier with DAC and phono stage.      costs US $2,199.  The Nova 300 fits in the same chassis Peachtree has successfully used for last 15 years:It is quite beefy and heavy.  Volume indication overloads the LED indicators on the input selectors showing a coarse 8 levels.  For this price, I would expect an LED indicator of the actual level.Back panel shows good quality connectors and rich feature set for a desktop amplifier:Peachtree made its name on DACs and had quite a following 10 to 15 years ago.  I was curious to see if they had upgraded the DAC subsystem since that time so let\\'s start by measuring that subsystem.Peachtree Nova 300 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit over USB input, sampled the output from preamp out and adjusted the volume to output 2 volts:Well, this is quite disappointing.  Noise and distortion as represented by SINAD is in decidedly \"poor\" category in today\\'s market:The unit can output higher levels so let\\'s see where peak performance is:No luck there as the peak is actually at 1 volt out.Dynamic range is better indicating distortion is the problem:At this point I didn\\'t see a need to run more DAC tests and switched to testing the amplifier.Peachtree Nova 300 Amplifier MeasurementsFor this test I used the Aux analog input:Ah, this is very respectable and above average performance:SNR is not as good as I like at 5 watt but gets better at full power:Crosstalk is excellent:Frequency response shows a peaky filter though:Multi-tone results indicate \"good enough\" performance:What was most impressive is the amount of power available from the ICE amplifier module they are using:Since I am driving two channels, this is over 900 watts of power!  Indeed the peaks hit 1000+ watts:Even at 8 ohm there is copious amount of power available:Interesting to see little dependency on frequency until we hit a few watts:ConclusionsIt is clear from the measurements that the DAC subsystem is a relic that is simply behind times.  The product though benefits from using a competent B&O ICE module which has stayed competitive producing far more power than you would expect in a \"lifestyle\" product of this kind.  As such, I expect subjective performance of Nova 300 to be excellent regardless of what speaker you attach to it.  I usually don\\'t worry about price/performance in my reviews -- that is yours to worry about.    But here, the price seems quite high relative to the other internet focused amplifiers which have come out in the last couple of years.  Some of those are powerful and all of them cost a lot less than the Nova 300.Overall, I can\\'t recommend the Peachtree Nova 300 as a new purchase.   -',\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio BT20A stereo class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 IC.   costs US $99.99 with 32 volt power supply.Despite its low cost, the case gives a feeling of quality. I am not usually fan of tone controls in low cost amps because you can never set them to flat response  . As you will in the measurements, Fosi has made sure that they work correctly in this instance.  A stout power switch controls power. In addition to 32 volt supply, company also shipped the optional   48 volt supply which is quite a giant:As you see, Bluetooth input is also supported.FYI there is an included orange volume control knob to give the unit some color.Fosi Audio BT20A Pro MeasurementsThe tests are in 48 volt unless I say otherwise  .  Here is our dashboard:Notice the great channel match in addition to very good SINAD which represents noise and distortion.  Same is true with 32 volt supply:This nicely lands the BT20A Pro in the \"very good\" category of all amplifiers tested regardless of price:Zooming in to see the competition:SNR is good for the class:I expect load/impedance dependency in this class of switching amplifiers but here, the peaking is almost entirely out of band which is good:Seeing how you have tone controls anyway, you could tailor any peaking with adjustment of the treble control.  Won\\'t be exact but should be good enough.That aside, note how the response is more or less is flat in audible band with the treble and bass controls set to their detent, center position.Multitone is good enough for the class:Crosstalk is very good:Let\\'s start our 4 ohm power measurements with 48 volt supply:Wow, this little box can pump out some serious watts, albeit in the short term testing!  Switching to 32 volts cuts this down even though 4 ohm is mostly current limited:The larger power supply must have more capacitor reservoirs than the 32 volt.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally see the biggest hit to power: []Although to be fair, I put the cursor at an earlier point than for 48 volt supply  .I was pleasantly surprised by the transfer function being so smooth:Finally there is not much of a pop on but there is for off:ConclusionsThe TI TPA3255 seems to be a capable platform when paired with a good implementation which is what we have in BT20A Pro.  You get a sense of that in company marketing material which includes Audio Precision measurements.  Usability is excellent with high quality case and controls especially with respect to ability to set the tone controls to flat.It is also nice to see so much power coming out of this little box with the beefy 48 volt power supply, showcasing the advancements in amplification density we have today.As an aside, the company has been a joy to work with.  They were exceptionally polite, cordial and patient as I went through my testing and evaluation.  They tell me they have internal R&D team and it shows.I am happy to add the Fosi Audio BT20A Pro to my recommended list. ',\n",
       " ' IOTAVX SA3 integrated stereo amplifier with built-in DAC and subwoofer output.  It was kindly purchased by   drop shipped to me.  It costs £399.00   on company\\'s website.  Hard to find it on sale in US but found one ebay listing for $498.SA3 nails the industry design with svelte chassis, dot matrix display and judicious use of backlighting for the logo: I left the plastic on the display as otherwise it looks nicer than it does in the picture.  A reassuring power button is the left and a nice feeling rotary control handles the volume.  If you press it, it becomes an input selector.  Very nicely done.Back panel shows a lot of inputs:There is phono input which I did not test.  I did test both analog input and Toslink digital input.  Sadly there is no USB input.  There is bluetooth but no streaming support over network.Let\\'s get started by using the line in   input to the power amp and work our way out to the DAC section.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWith integrated amplifiers with volume controls, I adjust that to produce roughly 29 dB of gain which is a THX \"standard.\"  That gives us this dashboard:Distortion dominates with second harmonic telling the full story.  Wish channel 2 was as good as channel 1 but this is typical.  Averaging the two we get this kind of ranking:So above average among 89 amplifiers tested so far  .  But not state of the art by any stretch.Noise performance is good:You almost clear the CD\\'s 16-bit dynamic range at 96 dB at 5 watts output.Typical of class AB designs, bandwidth is abundant:Should the zombie apocalypse come, you can hook up a few hundred yards of wire to the speaker wire and have yourself an AM transmitter power amp!!!  A microphone and simple modulator and you could be talking to people thousands of miles away at night....Crosstalk is surprisingly good:If you look inside the chassis, you realize why.  A toroidal transformer is in the middle with each amplifier nicely separated from each other by good 8 to 10 inches.Power output at 4 ohms falls a bit short of the spec:And I am not too happy about the constant rise in distortion from just 1 watt, ending worse than one of our worse performing Audio Video Receiver  .It is a bit happier driving an 8 ohm load:That\\'s not a lot of power though so best get an efficient speaker is 8 ohm is the language it speaks.Fortunately burst power is quite decent  :Changing the frequency of the test tone hardly bothers the SA3:Other topologies such as Class D make a mess out of this measurement.DAC Audio MeasurementsTaking advantage of the pre-amp output, I fired off a few DAC tests to get an idea of how good that subsystem is starting with our digital dashboard:OK, this is a bit disappointing.  You want a SINAD here that is 10 dB better than the amp for it to be transparent.  Here it is actually a couple of dB worse then the amplifier which means the combo will drag down the performance of the amplifier some.As a DAC, it falls in the failing   category of all DACs tested to date:Noise performance is decent:Intermodulation+noise test is disappointing:The upper line in orange is a phone dongle!  The SA3 hugs that performs like it is related to it which it should not be.Jitter performance looks better than it is due to high noise floor potentially hiding other spurious tones:So overall the DAC portion is barely a match for the amplifier.  If the amp gets the grade B, the DAC gets a C+.ConclusionsIt is nice to see a fresh take on the integrated stereo amplifier from IOTAVIX.  The SA3 looks attractive, has good feature set including many inputs from digital to analog and takes up little space. You can nicely put it under your monitor, add a couple of speakers and be in business.You don\\'t get to brag its measured performance but what is there \"is not broken\" which is often an accomplishment in world of audio.  Performance is solid across the board with the DAC trailing a bit.  I would happily use it in a secondary system.Overall, I am going to recommend the IOTAVIX SA2 amplifier. ',\n",
       " \"  of Living Sound Audio Electronics Voyager GAN 350 stereo amplifier.     costs US 3,000 from the company.I really like the high-end look of this amplifier case:Strange though as there is no power indicator, nor switch.  The latter is in the back only:I really dislike the hard to read type on the back.  Other than that, the connectors seem to be of good quality.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses GaN transistors to ostensibly lower distortion and increase efficiency of the amplification.  In use, the bottom where all the modules are mounted barely god warm so efficiency is good.LSA Voyager GAN350 MeasurementsI started my testing with XLR inputs which showed really odd results:As you see, the gain is nearly 10 dB different between the channels.  I looked for con uration switches but couldn't find anything.  After wasting half hour, I switched to RCA input and problem vanished:If I were to guess I would say the XLR input is miswired on one channel.  Bad execution if so in such an expensive amplifier.  For the rest of the test I stuck with RCA input.Signal to noise ratio while OK, is not state of the art:I like to see full 16 bit/96 dB dynamic range at 5 watts.  We fall short here.Frequency response was sad to see:Class D amplifiers have a low pass filter that can interact with the load if not designed well and that is what we have here.  The impact falls clearly in audible band.  This would be OK for a budget amplifier in $100 range but not in this class.  Depending on what speaker you hook up to this amplifier, the highs may be exaggerated or filtered.Crosstalk on the other hand was exceptional due to dual mono design and no crosstalk through the power supply:Multitone performance was also very good, indicating low intermodulation distortion:Power was healthy into 4 ohm albeit with unexceptional distortion and noise levels:There is still plenty of power available even into 8 ohm:Interesting how distortion keeps rising and clipping is rather soft.  As they state, this indicates low amount of negative feedback.Transfer function is frequency dependent with distortion rising quite a bit at higher frequencies  :Spectrum of switching frequency shows good attenuation but not that high of a frequency:If they had opted for higher speed which GaN transistors allow, the impact of the output filter would have been lower  .The amplifier doesn't need any warm up as it is stable on power on:ConclusionsOther than having a lot of power and good efficiency, there is not much else to be happy here.  Clearly companies are using GaN as a buzzword without fully taking advantage of what it can provide.  Lots of money is left on the table here in many areas from frequency response load dependency to high amount of distortion.  At the end of the day, you have an expensive, high power amplifier here with average performance.I can't recommend the LSA Voyager GAN 350.  Performance is not there, nor is quality control.Edit: teardown just posted:  always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   \",\n",
       " '  of AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier with Bluetooth support.   costs US $139.99.It is so nice to see a VU meter on an amplifier!  This one actually seems high quality with nice ballistic response  . Bass and Treble controls are there but I wish there was a tone defeat as well. The position of the indicators is where I had to set them for more or less flat response. I do like the very fine detents on it, allowing you to more precisely adjust them at least.The included power supply is one of the largest I have seen but is rather light for its size:There are no remotes so the amp is for desktop use.  Class D implementation means the amp ran with no temperature rise even after all my tests. Protection circuit was excellent with automatic restarted after overload. The meter is useful in this regard as the amp shuts down when the meter is almost at the end of its range.AIYIMA A08 Pro MeasurementsI warmed up the unit for about 10 minutes with very stable response:Running our dashboard we see the usual good performance from AIYIMA amplifier range:Performance is above average despite the very low cost:Noise level falls in the same category of very good:As noted, there was a bit of a struggle to get flat response:And typical of their designs, there is load dependency.Crosstalk was above average for all amplifiers tested:Multitone performance was very good:This little box outputs good bit of power at 4 ohms:Even with 8 ohm load you have good bit of it:Transfer function   is pretty good for class:ConclusionsAIYIMA has a good class D platform which they turn into various con urations with good success.  The A08 Pro is no exception.  You get unique looks and to some extent, functionality at still a very reasonable price.  With 100 watts per channel, both driven, you have very nice capability to drive any desktop speaker to its limit.  My own wish is the remedy of the load dependency but otherwise, this is a job well done.I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier. ---As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   ',\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A07 desktop amplifier based on TPA3255 class D amplifier chip.      drop shipped to me.  The cost is US $72 on Amazon including prime shipping.  And as of this shipping, it also included a 32 volt, 5 amp switching power supply.  Member also purchased and sent me a 48 volt/3 amp power supply which I also tested.The case is standard budget audio affair:The volume control feels cheep but does the job.  The back panel terminals were way too small for my binding posts:The DC input socket was quite stiff especially with the 48 volt power supply.  Tightness is not a bad thing as far as power transfer is concerned but this was a bit too stiff.  Here are the two power supplies:They both feel kind of cheap as they would be at these prices  .  Personally I would not leave these plugged in permanently if I am not around.  The included power supply has a two-pronged AC cable that was not polarized.  Rotating it around made a small difference in mains leakage.AIYIMA A07 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohms:As you see in the FFT display, there is considerable amount of mains leakage at 60 Hz.  This tends to be a function of switching power supplies.  I played with grounding and improved it a lot in one channel but not in the other  .  SINAD did not get impacted since it is bound by distortion harmonics.  As it is, performance is above average:Signal to noise ratio is not great due to the mains hum:Frequency response is well behaved, albeit with a slight droop at 20 kHz:Crosstalk is good and well above bargain basement desktop amps:Power is everything in a small amp so let's see how we do with 4 ohm load:As expected, with low impedance of 4 ohm we are current limited so the 5 amp stock power supply does better, turning in 77 watts.  Yes, the 300 watt rating is a fantasy but maybe it can do better with momentary peaks.  Alas, its aggressive protection circuit would shut it down and not let me test max and peak power.Naturally the higher voltage power supply does better with 8 ohm load where we become voltage limited:Sweeping power vs frequency and distortion shows a very well behaved class D amplifier:ConclusionsTraditionally these desktop amplifiers have produced really poor performance in the form of noise and distortion.  Not so anymore.  These TPA3255 based amps seem to have good bones in them, producing above average performance for peanuts.  Alas, you are saddled with two boxes and cheap and potentially non-safety compliant parts.  For desktop use, these are probably acceptable compromises.  I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A07 based on its performance.And with this, our last review of 2020 comes to an end!  Nice that it is ending on a happy note.   -\",\n",
       " ' Linn AV5125 5-channel amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  It is out of production but originally cost US $2999.  I only see one used one on ebay for $2100 which seems pretty expensive for an old amp.  Then again Linn is a high-end audio company so maybe it holds its value?EDIT: member feedback shows prices are really in US $600 range for used units.Despite the high channel count, the AV5125 is quite light and small:The back of the unit shows the unusual BFA   speaker connectors:I had to rebuild my test harness to test it which I was none too happy about it.  It basically a banana plug but hollow on the inside.The trick to light weight is a switching power supply and a set of fans to cool the heatsinks:A pair of integrated IC amps are used for each channel.  The heatsink is beefy despite its reduced height.  In use the fans never came on.  I am suspecting some kind of rail switching is used to keep power consumption low.Overall, it is a \"cute\" design if you have to ask me.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with a simple 1 kHz tone driving the amplifier to 5 watts with 4 ohm load:SINAD which is a combined metric of noise and distortion is above average of 90+ amplifiers tested in all forms:Crosstalk is not very good:Frequency response is also not flat which is surprising:Dynamic range though is very good especially near full power:As noted though, when I ran the full power test momentarily, it started to scream quite loud.  How loud you say?  Well, my wife who was downstairs, listening to her podcast using headphones heard it and asked, \"are you making that beeping sound?\"  So there, we also have wife stories in our tests!Power test produced an unusual curve:As you see in the two reference amplifier tests in dashed lines, usually the graph points down due to noise contributions lowering as power goes up.  Not here.  The curve is flat which indicates constant distortion.  That is not a bad thing per se as we see really good performance until we exceed 20 watts and then we get ordinary response.Same repeats with 8 ohm load:Here, at low power we have very clean output.Back to 4 ohm load, we can see how much more power we get if we relax distortion to 1% and also measuring momentary power:The news is not good as is typical in amplifiers with switching power supplies which run regulated.  For good or bad, you get maximum power they have in all conditions.  Typical class AB amplifier has unregulated power supply rails which due to a capacitor bank, can produce more power in short duration.ConclusionsThis is an unusual design from a high-end company which went after \"home theater\" market back in the day when they could  .  The guts is not high-end but seems custom and well thought out.  Performance is reasonable to good.  I tend to like the originality, small size, light weight and proper engineering from this Scottish company.If you can find one on the cheap  , then it is worth looking at the Linn AV5125.  I am going to recommend it more from emotional point of view, than logic.   ',\n",

Design is based on TI TPA3255 IC.AIYIMA A200 MeasurementsLet's start with RCA input:SINAD which represents a measure of noise and distortion is above average:Unfortunately digital input degrades that some:So the rest of the tests are with RCA input.  SNR is good for class:As is distortion as represented by multitone:Frequency response is flat enough but is load   dependent:Crosstalk is good:Let's see how much clean power it can produce with 4 and 8 ohm loads:Allowing for 1% THD we don't get more power but burst delivery is higher:For a desktop amp, this is pretty good amount of juice.Sweeping at different frequencies shows very predictable response:Of note, power doesn't drop much at 20 Hz which is very good  .Finally the amp is good more or less when you power it up:ConclusionsAIYIMA once again shows that it has as solid hold in the mid-power amplifier market with above average performance at bargain prices. Integrated power supply solves one of the hassles of their separates and provides nice turnkey solution.  Interface and build is good for the class.  So really, if you want a competent amplifier with good power and little money, you have it.I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A200 amplifier. -\",\n",
       " \" Hegel H95 integrated amplifier with DAC and streaming support.     costs US $2000.The H95 looks pretty nice:I really like the large, high resolution and very responsive graphic display. What I don't like is the absence of power button on the front face.  After some research I found out it is on the bottom.  I realize without it there is symmetry but the one or two times that you play something super loud and want to rush to shut it off, you will hate the fact that it will take some effort to reach under to power it down.  Another thing I didn't like is lack of acceleration on volume control.  You have to crank and crank it to turn it all the way up and down.The back panel shows the extra connectively over a standard analog amplifier:Very nice to see built-in DAC and Ethernet streaming.  What is not is the maximum supported sample rate of 96 kHz over USB.  This tells me they are using ancient and obsolete USB interface.  They say they did this for ease of design and to save money to put toward making the DAC itself better.  We will see about that.A simple plastic remote control is provided which is very similar to what we see from Chinese desktop manufacturers.  I tend to like it but it is unusual for such an expensive product to come with this kind of remote.  Usually they include some heavy but harder to use remote.Hegel H95 DAC MeasurementsThis being an amplifier, I immediately jumped to measuring that part of it first.  But then I had to backtrack when I noticed digital input performance was worse than analog.  Given the line out, I decided to measure the DAC using coax input.  For some reason, like a Hegel DAC I tested in the past, my ASIO4ALL interface would not see the USB input so I decided to test with Coax.  Here is our dashboard with volume control adjusted to produce the nominal 2 volts:I don't need to tell you that this is stunning high level of distortion, landing the H95 seven from the bottom list of some 350 DACs tested:When sweeping IMD distortion level, we can see part of the problem:This is something we see in Audio/Video receivers where they set the optimal gain to drive their amplifiers and not the 2 volts we are looking for.  Even then performance is not good, barely showing less noise than a $9 phone dongle!  We can measure the noise itself:This is horrid performance in any modern DAC.Back to distortion, we see that again in multitone test:Jitter performance is lackluster and what I would expect to see from random ebay DAC:To finish our suffering, here is poor linearity measurement:I think they may have unseated Schiit with their multibit DACs and poor linearity!Really, really bad showing.Hegel H95 Amplifier MeasurementsI first started with line in and adjusted the volume to get the nominal gain of 29 dB we use in integrated amplifier tests:Noise and distortion is just above average:I expected a lot better as the company's claim to fame is a comparator which supposedly detects distortion and sends an inverted signal to the amp to correct.  We see plenty of amplifiers without such circuit performing far better as you can see in above graph.  And of course we have products that use true feed forward technology such as Benchmark AHB2 currently occupying #1 spot in above graph.What's more, there are stability issues with that circuit  .  Check out the warm up performance of this amplifier:I have never seen anything like this.  Variations are quite large   with two very large spikes.  It never stabilized even though I let it warm up far longer than other amps to tune of 17 minutes.  Best case performance was actually when the amplifier was just powered on at 80.5 dB SIAND but then finishing at 79.5.  Switching to DAC input which one would hope would eliminate source of external noise made things worse, not better in that regard:You are losing 9 dB in SINAD due to much higher noise floor.  Why or why?  Again, AV receivers do this but I don't think I have measured this kind of degradation before when using digital input.So from here on I focused on analog input.  Here is our dynamic range:I like to see 96 dB at 5 watts but 91 is fine.  The max power performance doesn't improve much because this is not a very powerful amplifier.Crosstalk is also good:Frequency response is flat in audible band:Power output is just 63 watts into 4 ohm at the knee of the distortion curve:Allowing for more distortion and busting sharply increased available power:Power into 8 ohm is very low for this expensive of an amplifier:Checking for frequency dependency we see something limiting power before the amplifier naturally doing so:Hegel H95 Headphone AmplifierI usually don't bother testing headphone output on this type of amplifier as it is usually an afterthought.  But company talks about improving its output and noise level relative to prior products so I decided to test it some.  Here is our power curve into 300 ohm:I like to see 100 milliwatts of power here and 80 is close enough.  Switching to low impedance, we should get a lot more power but we do not:The guarantee reason is high output impedance and that is precisely what we have:I am amazed that in this day and age companies like Hegel are not aware of the fact that high impedance is bad for many headphones   and that even budget headphone amps have impedance below 1 ohm.  77 ohm is just out of the question.ConclusionsLet's quickly agree that both the DAC and headphone amplifiers are junk.  They are better off leaving both out.  You can do better with hundreds of products that cost the same as the shipping or tax of the H95.  I watched one video where the youtuber said he preferred the sound of Hegel DAC to his Chord Mojo in some ways.  Wonder what he thinks now.The amplifier in H95 is good as far as noise and distortion but nothing to write home about.  Continuous power is very low for an amplifier costing $2000 however.This is just a bad attempt all around.  I can't see any reason to recommend Hegel H95.

       " ' SMSL DA-6 stereo desktop class D amplifier. It was sent to me by Shenzhen Audio and costs US $99.Ah, what a pleasure it was to unpack the DA-6 and see this nice thin packaging!  That niceness extends to the back, fixing one of my main complaints with compact amplifiers:Instead of stacking the binding posts on top of each other and thereby making it very difficult to put large binding posts, they are lined up horizontally.  This allowed me to connect my locking banana plugs into them with relative ease. Of course we are saddled with large laptop power supply running at 24 volts at nearly 7 amps.A remote control is provided to navigate through the menus to change bass/treble settings, volume control, etc.  Same can be done with the front panel and rotary control.A new Infineon class D amplifier IC is used here  .SMSL DA-6 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard:Relative sum of noise+distortion as expressed in SINAD lands the unit above average of some 350 amplifiers tested:I am assuming volume is controlled digitally given the perfect channel balanced.  Noise performance by itself is good for the class:Frequency response in EQ bypass mode still has a bit of low frequency roll off:Type of speaker you drive with this little amp could benefit from being pushed to play those low frequencies.  I thought I could fix that by boosting the bass setting one notch.  That tool though brings a sledgehammer to a nail being put on the wall to hang a picture:Oh, I forgot to mention that there is no load dependency which is something we often can\\'t find even in expensive class D amplifiers.  Not only that, the response is quite extended, going beyond 100 kHz!  I guess this is what they mean by \"high-resolution.\"There is no warm up requirement as the unit is stable out of the box, running quite cool:Multitone performance is again good for the class:Output power is more modest than I wanted to see but I guess you can\\'t have miracles:The response though seems dependent on level and keeps changing at micro level.   We see the same when we sweep with different frequencies:There is no headroom as expected:ConclusionsSMSL nails the industrial design and usability of a super compact desktop amplifier offered in attractive aluminum case.  A clear white display shows the volume control and inclusion of remote control lets you place it out of the way and still change its volume.  I don\\'t usually take price into account but in this class I must.  For $99 this is a lot of performance and good lucks/design.I am happy to recommend SMSL DA-6. ',\n",
       " ' B&K Components AV30.2 Power Amplifier. The AV30.2 is discontinued but is available on the used market for low price I am told.  I found one listing with asking price of $175 but not others.  The good news is that it uses the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE class-D amplifier module so the review should be relevant to other amplifiers in the market now.The B&K amp is targeted the CI   market meaning it is usually installed in home and businesses by a dealer/installer as part of a larger system.  This amp for example could be hidden behind a flat panel TV powering a couple of speakers.  For this reason, the form-factor and connectivity follows the requirements for this market.Here is the front panel:The \"business end\" is on the back:As you can tell, there is fair amount of connectivity for home automation.  I did not investigate them but I imagine you can power the unit on and off remotely to say, synchronise with the TV being turned on/off.I liked the level control for both channels.  It is buttery smooth, putting many other volume controls to shame.  Using that, I was able to get perfect match between the two channels -- something you can\\'t hardly do with any modern amplifier anymore.The speaker connections use phoenix connectors which while super common in CI industry, was not the greatest choice here.  It was very easy to have the outputs short out if you left any copper sticking out the screw terminal.  In use, the connector did not make tight enough connection causing the performance of one channel to vary as much as 20 dB.  It was tight by feel but noise level would go up and down if I wiggled it.  For intended application probably did not matter.  If you want to use it for hifi home application, you may want to hard wire them if you run into the same issue I did.In use, the unit barely got warm to touch.  There is plenty of ventilation on top and bottom which helps in this regard as does the high efficiency of its switchmode power supply and class-d amplification module.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard at 5 watt into 4 ohm:I adjusted the output gain to 29 dB which means the controls were near max.  Performance may vary some at lower gain values.  I used 29 dB since it is probably the most common/THX recommended gain level.THD+N was 0.008%.  The 50ASX2SE spec from what I recall is less than half at 0.003%.  The discrepancy may be due to gain stage, the connector and just variation in units.  Overall, it is in the ballpark of what they advertise.   This translates into a SINAD above mid-point of all the amplifiers we have tested:Signal to noise ratio is just good enough for 16-bit audio playback at 98 dB at full power:On right is the same measurement but relative to max of 5 watts.  SNR does not drop much which is very good.Frequency response was dead flat in audible band and quite well-behaved with output filtering:Wide-band FFT spectrum shows ugliness that we typically see in class-d amps   and this is probably a more uglier than the normal picture:More of a visual scare though than audio.Most important measurement for an amplifier is power versus distortion and noise.  Let\\'s start with the common load of 4 ohm:As you see, one channel started to deviate as I said in the introduction.  But still, both of them are smooth and well-behaved giving us a power rating of 42 watts before hard clipping sets in.At 8 ohm, power level drops a lot as you would expect:Funny there though in how much lower noise and distortion the AV30.2 has compared to the NAD T758 AV Receiver  .  Would be a good replacement for it had it had more power.  If the modules higher in range have same performance, they may be a good application to power home theaters.That said, these modules have almost no headroom as their peak power is almost the same as average:This is because unlike class AB amplifiers, the power supply in these class-D amps is regulated and so other than some storage in output caps, can\\'t provide more juice for short periods. Another sign of good design is how the performance of the amplifier varies with level and frequency:Each line pair of the same color   is at a different frequency.  An ideal amplifier would not care about frequency so all the graphs would land on top of each other.  Here, they vary some but much less than some other amplifiers I have measured.ConclusionsThe B&K AV30.2 provides competent performance across suite of measurements.  It runs cool, is efficient and small.  It easily outperforms mass market AVRs for example.  Alas, there is not a lot of power here so other than desktop speaker application, I would seek out something more powerful.Overall, I am going to put the B&K AV30.2 and by implication, the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE on my recommended list for mid-level performance amplification. -',\n",
       " \" Niles SI-275 stereo power amplifier. The SI-275 is discontinued.  But since it is sold to the custom integration channel, they come up used and in working orders  .  I am told it can be picked up as low as US $100 to $150.  I see one on Amazon for US $230.  But there is a used one on ebay for $100.The look is fine:I like the tall feet on amplifiers to allow for more air flow.  A massive heatsink goes the full width of the unit with beefy transistors.  Love the fact that it has two trim resistors to balance the gain in both channels.  So annoying that these days balance controls are impossible to find yet amplifiers routinely have gain that is different in each channel  .Back panel is simplicity in itself:In use, the SI-275 was solid as a rock.  Never shut down.  Never complained even when fully clipped.  The top of the unit barely got warm despite using traditional class AB amplification.  That large and heavy heatsink does a great job of spreading the heat load.  Nothing remotely like flimsy heatsinks in mass market stereo amplifiers or audio/video receivers.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our dashboard:Notice the perfectly matched channels.  SINAD is middling but is actually better because distortion is near -100 dB.  It is pulled down by power supply noise which due to being low frequency is not very audible.  Using what we have, performance is slightly above average:Noise performance follows the same standard:Frequency response is dead flat in audible band and extends way up:The wider the bandwidth, the more challenging the design  .  Power into 4 ohm is healthy:Allowing for 1% THD+N, we get even more:8- Ohm power is:Response with bot loads is very controlled with no oddities.  Amplifier was stable as soon as powered on and performance did not change much after running for a few minutes  .ConclusionsThe Niles SI-275 is made for abuses of custom integration channel which routinely stuffs amplifiers in places they don't belong  .  Its construction is well beyond today's mass market product.  Measured performance is just above average.  Combine these with prices as low as just $100 and you have a great deal.I am happy to recommend used Niles SI-275.  Bargain shoppers rejoice!   -\",\n",
       " \" SMSL SA400 switching desktop power   amplifier.    for testing and costs US $660.The SA400 is a powerful amplifier yet it comes in the same compact SMSL package and UI you would find in their desktop amp:Amplification is provided courtesy of ST Micro STa516BE.  The marketing material for SA400 shows a digital feedback but I don't see that in the ST specs.  I am not clear if this is an addition by SMSL or it is part of ST amplifier chip that they don't talk about.  Either way the input to the amplifier is digital so even though we have analog inputs, they need to be digitized to be used internally:A resonant LLC switching power supply provides the heft juice needed to drive this amplifier in a small package.  Bluetooth input is provided as well as a subwoofer output with low pass filter.  In addition, tone controls are included using a dedicated JRC chip.There is an informative temperature measurement you can turn on which I did as you see in the picture above.  With normal music listening   the unit stay pretty cool.  In testing however, the case got fairly warm and the display indicated 58 degrees C.  I suggest not stacking anything on top of SA400.One issue is a mechanical whine from an internal coil.  I can hear it even when nothing is playing from about 1 foot or so.  When testing at higher powers, this became much louder but when playing music, you won't be able to hear it most likely.  SMSL SA400 MeasurementsThere are three gain settings but performance is very similar between them.  I adjusted high gain for 29 dB which is my standard  :For the rest of my testing I used the adjusted high gain for better comparison to other integrated amps adjusted the same way.Distortion is around -90 dB but what pulls down SINAD is the rather high noise floor.  This causes the overall ranking to be just slightly above average:Indeed we can see the noise issue in our SNR measurements:State of the art amplifiers get 16 bits of dynamic range at 5 watts so we are two bits short here.  Even at full power you are adding noise to a 16 bit signal  .  This, and the fact that there is no bandwidth above 20 kHz nukes any idea of playing high-res content:Sure would have been nice to use an ADC that was running at 48 kHz, not 44 as it seems to be.  Use of the ADC is likely the reason the noise floor is higher than it would be otherwise.  We have seen this in AV receivers which likewise digitize their analog inputs  .There is some very good news though. The feedback for the amplifier is taken post filtering which means it can compensate for the interaction between that filter and the load.  The above measurement shows actually two graphs: one at 8 ohm and the other, 4.  Both land on top of each other showing the amp doesn't care which is great.  We only see this in the best class D amps like Hypex Ncore and Purifi.Crosstalk was very good but unpredictable:You can see the normal trend in the other two amps  .Most important test for any amplifier is how much power we have and how much distortion and noise so let's look at that at 4 ohms:This is a powerful little amp, producing nearly 500 watts of power especially if you allow some peaking:It complies with the spec which I think is 220 watts.  Power naturally drops at 8 ohm but still healthy:On our last test which is power versus distortion+noise at different frequencies.  The output was quite unique:I have not seen a power amplifier show this level of frequency independence.  Yes, having only 20 kHz bandwidth helps but still, even linear amplifiers don't produce such dead straight and sameness the SA400 is producing.  This is quite excellent.Note that the the amp went into protection at both 20 kHz and 20 Hz in this sweep.  Alas there was no indication on the display. I had to power cycle the unit to get it to work again.SMSL SA400 Amplifier Listening TestsEven though I listen to every headphone amplifier, I only do so rarely for power amplifiers.  I decided to start doing listening tests with this amplifier which was a good thing.  I used an Infinity 253 speaker for my testing.  Despite driving only one channel, the SA400 drove the R253 with extreme authority and clarity.  Tons of detail and dynamics with little else to wish for.  Putting my ears next to the tweeter I could hear a slight hiss but a few inches away it would disappear.  The sound was so enjoyable I am still listening to it as I type this!ConclusionsSMSL brings us an interesting and unique power amplifier to us.  Love the load independence and small packaging plus tons of power.  Performance drops to average levels in some areas but nothing that appears to be faulty or poorly engineered.  I guess my one reservation is the cost.  I am not sure how much of this is temporary given the world order with component shortages, high shipping costs, etc. but to me, the better retail target would be $499.  The warranty is short at 1 year as well.  For DACs and such I am not worried about warranty much but for amps I do like to see longer warranty.Overall, I am going to put the SMSL SA400 on my recommended list.  It delivers tons of power with no weak points.  -\",\n",
       " \" Crown DCI 4 | 300N four channel DSP and networked professional amplifier. It was kindly purchased   and sent to me for testing and costs US $3,511.There is only a power on/off on the front. I wish there was a processing bypass as well. The full capability is visible on the back:I wouldn't be able to scratch the surfaces of all that this amplifier can do.  Suffice it to say you can do full processing  , environment/remote control, and transmission of digital audio over Ethernet type cabling.  Con uration is available using Audio Architect software.  Typical of these Pro applications, it takes a bit of effort to get used to its operation but after that, it seemed easy enough to use.A rather loud fan turns on during power on testing and then goes off.  Alas, during my testing it came back on.  Unless the amplifier is way away from your listening spot, better plan to put it in another room/dedicate closet.Connections are all through screw terminals. Not so bad for speakers but for balanced/unbalanced input, you are going to need to have bare wires  .  Not the end of the world but don't expect to buy and power on the same day if you don't have these bits.I was disappointed with the trim controls in the back.  They are very coarse and hard to adjust to an exact value.  And being on the rear makes it harder to manipulate.  For its intended application of professional installation is not a big deal but for one-off testing/use, is more work.I chose to test channels 3 & 4 as my standard setup is stereo.  During use, the amplifier case did not rise above ambient but again, the fan was running the whole time.Note: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and we move probably more Crown amplifier than any system integrated on the west coast.  So feel free to read bias into my subjective remarks.Crown 4|300N Amplifier MeasurementsUpon power on, output noise+distortion was quite stable which is nice:So on to our 1 kHz dashboard @ 5 watts into 4 ohm load:I must say, I expected much worse performance!  Distortion is below -100 dB and SINAD as a result, is dominated by noise.  As is, performance is a bit above average of many amplifiers tested to date:As noted, noise floor is somewhat high causing SNR at 5 watt to be below desirable level  :Using default settings  , this is our frequency response:I was surprised to see the response not being flatter at 4 ohm.  Still, we are talking about less than 0.5 dB.  Importantly, there is slight change with load change to 8 ohm, indicating small amount of load dependency  .Multitone yet again displays the low levels of distortion:Crosstalk is better than most amplifiers I measure:We have healthy amount of power into 4 ohm:And get even more when we allow 1% THD+N:Switching to 8 ohm load, we naturally get less but there is still good bit of power on tap:I was disappointed to see distortion rise though above 1 kHz as power increased:On the positive front, there is not much impact at 20 Hz so you can comfortably use the amp to power subs and such.Finally, turn on and off behavior is very good:Do notice the long time to turn on though  .ConclusionsNice to see that as we go up in price performance of a pro amplifier improves as well.  No, it is not state of the art but this combination of four channels with sophisticated DSP and audio streaming is not easy to find in consumer domain.I am going to put Crown 4 | 300N amplifier on my recommended list. -\",\n",
       " ' Behringer NX1000D power amplifier with DSP. Can\\'t tell if it is discontinued or not but see it on sale at one place for $299.  Retail cost is $549.I am a fan of orange displays and NX1000D delivers on that  :What I am not a fan of, pun intended, is the super loud fan that stays on all the time.  I walked away to go to the bathroom and was so surprised that I could hear it from very far distance in the house.  Unless you can put it in a sealed cabinet, I don\\'t see it being useful for hi-fi use.  Maybe you can modify it to quiet the fan or make it temperature sensitive. On the positive front, I really liked the look and feel of the control app that talks to it:The only thing I did not like about it is that it is not clear when some processing is on or off.  For example above, is the peak limiter on or off???The back panel shows SpeakOn connectors:And of course combo XLR/1/4 inch balanced inputs.  You can bridge the two channels although I did not test this con uration.  The \"1000\" designation is for total amount of power available.  As you will see, I was not able to come close to that in stereo use with 4 ohm load.Behringer NX1000D MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is average performance as amplifiers go:But it is good for pro amps.  SNR falls in the same category:Best in class amplifiers produce 96 dB at 5 watts and we are pretty shy of that.  So be mindful of background noise you may get out of your speakers if they are sensitive.Frequency response thankfully is load independent as the company advertises: Due to inclusion of DSP though, your bandwidth is severely cut to that of 44.1/48 kHz sampling.  So \"no high res sampling for you!\"Crosstalk was surprisingly good for the class:As I hinted, power delivery into 4 ohm is way under specifications:Even allowing for 1% THD and burst mode, we can\\'t get to the company spec:How did they get their 300 watt number?  Using car stereo \"standards?\"Power drops quite a bit into 8 ohm:Just 78 watts in a pro amplifier???  This is AVR class amount of power, not what you see in this class of product usually.Multi-tone test shows distortion increasing at both low and high-end of the spectrum:We see the same in our power testing versus frequency and distortion+noise:Notice how the 20 Hz distortion rises unusually what way.ConclusionsWe, the home users, look to pro products to get more wattage on the cheap.  Behringer unfortunately doesn\\'t give us that here.  Instead, it saddles the product with a loud, non-temperature sensitive fan which rules it out of many applications we may have for it.  So I don\\'t think it is a fit for what most of us want out of an amplifier even though there are some good qualities like load impedance independence, DSP, low cost, etc.As is, I can\\'t recommend the Behringer NX1000D. -',\n",
       " ' five channel Classe Sigma AMP5.  It was kindly sent to me by   originally cost US $5,000.  I see one on ebay for $1,900 right now.This is one heavy amplifier for a class D architecture:At first I thought it had a linear power supply and its transformer was the reason behind the weight.  Alas, looking into other reviews and pictures inside, it uses a switching power supply.  So all the weight is from the enclosure and likely the very thick front plate.At first I was hoping that the glossy front where the logo is, is an LCD display with VU meters and such.  But there is not.  It is just for looks.  I must say as high-end products go, it is not that attractive to me relative to the high cost of the enclosure.  It has sharp corners which is not nice.The back shows quality selection of parts:I like the staggered speaker binding posts which makes it easier to plug things in.  XLR connections is what I like to see in an amp in this price range and we have them.  This amp was mated to their processor of the time which I suspect is discontinued longer than this amp.Amplifier MeasurementsI tested two channels   using XLR input.  Here is our dashboard:Rather high second and third harmonics dominate causing the overall ranking to be middle of the road:Nice to see precise channel matching though.Frequency response showed unexpected results:Researching I found out there is an analog to digital converter which explains the sharp cut off.  I thought that meant DSP functions but there is none.  Instead, the digital signal is used as part of a protection circuit.  I can see that as a parallel path but not as the main path compromising the response this way.  This amp came out in 2015 so it is not like we didn\\'t have higher sample rates available then to at least go up to 48 kHz and get us flat audible response.Signal to noise ratio is middle of the road as well:Crosstalk is \"OK\" but should be better:Power vs distortion shows odd response at 4 ohm which gets worse at 8 ohm  :Very strange noise response at the start and the multiple sources of distortion take over, each causing their own non-linearities. On the positive front, we have healthy amount of power.  Not much more is available though in burst mode  :Here is power into 8 ohm:That step function is quite bizarre. Worst measurements came when bandwidth was increased to 45 kHz and frequency sweeps were used:No way this amplifier is so well behaved.  Instead I think there is high amplitude noise that is masking any distortion present  .  We can see that if we perform a wideband frequency analysis:We see sharp increase in noise right above audible band.  This is either caused by noise shaping in the ADC, the Amp or both and explains the previous graph.There is naturally switching spikes   but I am disappointed that its level is just 8 dB or so below our fundamental.  I like to see 20 dB or more attenuation. ConclusionsThis is a custom Class D design and switching power supply from Classe.  It clearly shows deficiencies of the design and creating a market for Hypex to come and show how class D is done.  Digitizing the input is not a good idea if there is no user benefit to it and there is none here.We could get depressed about the above or look at copious amount of power this amplifier produces while remaining cool  .  Since lack of power is the #1 reason amps sound bad, I am going to put enough emphasis on this as to not give it a failing grade.Overall, I am neutral on the Classe Amp5.  At current sale prices, you have about $400 per channel for 400+ watts of power.  It may be hard to match this with Hypex amp so you decide if it is worth it or not. -',\n",
       " \" Schiit Vidar stereo amplifier. The Vidar costs US $699 and nicely comes with a five   year warranty.  With amplifiers being one of the most susceptible audio products to failure, long warranty is a real value.The Vidar sports the usual design style of Schiit which in this form factor is attractive:Despite its narrow width, the Vidar is quite heavy as it uses a linear power supply and class AB amplification topology.Back panel connectors are fine but I always miss balanced inputs in audio products:During power testing and such, the Vidar got fairly warm but not too hot and typical of the category.  It only shut down once when I ran a sweep causing it to clip at 20 kHz.I only tested the unit in stereo mode and not bridged.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone delivering 5 watts into 4 ohm load:We see the typical power supply noise spikes to the left and right of our tone.  SINAD   is dominated by second harmonic distortion though which rises to -80 dB or so in the worse channel.  As it is, performance is a few notches above average of some 85 amplifiers tested to date:Signal to noise ratio and crosstalk follow the same ranking:Frequency response is excellent though:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important aspect of an amplifier is amount of power it can deliver cleanly.  Let's start with 4 ohm load:We are getting 183 watts which is a bit shy of the 200 watt specification.  But that is at higher distortion.  If we allow that, we get there as well:Unlike class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, class AB amps like Vidar have much higher peak performance for short duration as you see above right.Using 8 ohm load we actually beat the company spec:Finally, the difficult test of power versus distortion versus frequency:Nice to see these lines without any strange curves and overlap.  This indicates there are no hidden dragons in the design of Vidar, just a standard degradation with frequency.ConclusionsSeems that Schiit set up to design a straightforward Class AB amplifier with lots of powers and no design flaws.  In that regard, it succeeds.  You have an attractive amplifier with long warranty and lots of power into 4 ohm load.  At US $699, it is priced well.Overall, I am happy to recommend the Schiit Vidar. \",\n",
       " ' Parasound 2125 V.2 power amplifier.     costs US $899.The 2125 has an understated look with just a few touches to keep it from looking boring. The only controls in front are for which set of speakers it drives.  There is more however in the back:For those of you wanting to use it with a sub, it has selectable high pass filter of 20 or 40 Hz.  Trigger is supported as well as bridging.Parasound 2125 V.2 MeasurementsI had a heck of a time getting stable ratings in the dashboard with channel 1 mostly going nuts on its own. I thought this was a grounding problem so tried many things.  There was hardly a difference.  It was not until the power measurements that I realized something is going on the amp in the 5 to 20 watt range.  Anyway, here is our dashboard when both channels were behaving:Measured noise+distortion lands the 2125 above average ranking:Noise performance is not great at 5 watts but naturally improves at full power:Multitone reflect the average distortion rating:Frequency response is very good:I was however surprised that gain dropped when I activated the high-pass filters.As noted, my first power sweep had instability in mid power.  I thought this was instrumentation error so I filtered the heck out of it and got these:On reflection though this was amplifier instability as we can see when I sweep the frequency:There is a frequency dependent hump in distortion which is very strange.  It is likely due to some kind of voltage rail switching.There is a lot of power available though in a cool running case:ConclusionsThis kind of performance would usually garner my recommendation for the 2125. On reflection though, I am worried about increased distortion in the \"sweet\" area of power band -- 5 to 20 watts.  Company needs to work on mitigating this issue.  So for now, I won\\'t be recommending the Parasound 2125 even though it checks many boxes from value to functionaltiy. ',\n",
       " \" Class D Audio   CDA-250C Power   Amplifier. The CDA-250C costs USD $495 from the company direct which barely sneaks it into affordable class.There is not a whole lot to look at on the face of the unit:As you see, the unit is made in USA.  I suspect the case is generic Chinese though given the DIY look and feel it has.The power button is oddly in the right side of the unit.The back panel sports very large speaker jacks which is nice:Unfortunately there are no balanced inputs even though the holes seem to be made for them.Another miss is lack of any safety or regulatory certification.In testing, the CDA-250C ran completely cool.  I could not feel slightest rise in temperature of the case whether I touched the top, left or right, which is really good.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard at 5 watts of output:I was pleased to see the unit working well enough to allow me to measure it down to DC and hence the DC offset.  Many recent switching amplifiers make my analyzer go crazy if I DC couple of it.SINAD   is rather low and seems to be driven by high noise floor than distortion products  .Signal to noise ratio is disappointing:We can't even clear the CD's 96 dB at either 5 watt.  We barely get there with 200 watts of output  .The news gets pretty ugly when I measured THD+N versus frequency at six different power levels:We have multiple problems here.  At both low and high end of the frequency spectrum we have rising noise and or distortion.  The higher the power, the worse they get.At low power outputs  , low frequency noise seems to escalate which may be due to power supply noise.To top it all, two channel are wildly different than each other.  One seems to be a lot more susceptible to noise than the other.Let's look at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone with wide bandwidth and see if we can  ure this out:I should have run this without my external filter but let's run with it anyway.  We see our usual spikes in hundreds of kilohertz due to switching frequencies.  But we also see a rise in noise around 50 kHz or so.  The previous test uses 90 kHz bandwidth so this peak will impact the measurements.  Note again the channel mismatch.Let's rerun the previous test, this time by limiting the bandwidth to 22.4 kHz.  Note that this means that we can't capture anything past second harmonic for the high frequencies  :The graph becomes somewhat cleaner especially at low output level  .  But otherwise, the signature issues with distortion/noise remain.Let's run our typical power versus distortion test.  Note that 1 kHz tone is used for this test so doesn't incorporate the issues we see above:We have good bit of power reaching 178 watts into 4 ohm before clipping sets in. FYI, I have refined this test to give us more resolution near max power so it is a bit unfair to previous products I tested.  Still, this is quite a bit more power than the two reference amps in the graph.When I get a chance later, I will test the output impedance versus frequency.  And a frequency response test which I just realized I forgot to run too.  ConclusionsGetting nearly 200 watts/channel into 4 ohm for a US made power amplifier for $500 is not bad.  Outside of that, you have to close your eyes to many flaws.  These noise and distortion issues way dwarf anything upstream.  As such, I don't see the Class D Audio CDA-250C in any kind of high fidelity system.  Our search will continue for something with Hypex NC400 performance but at half the price.Needless to say, I can't recommend the CDA-250C but you can judge it for yourself and your application based on above data and decide. -\",\n",

I went to look up the price just now and it says no longer available!  I think it was US 116.The enclosure is heftier than is typical for the class:A cute set of white LEDs rotate around the volume control when first turned on and then indicate volume level.   An unusual twist for this class of amplifier is inclusion of mains power supply:No  ure-8 power cord was included however so I have to supply my own.  As you see, there is a little fan to help with cooling but it never came on during my testing.  I had the top open and touching the heatsinks showed that they were pretty cool which explains the fan staying off.Note that while there is a DSP subsystem, I did not test it.  It is based on \"Sigma\" ADAU1701 platform which I already reviewed. Amplification is provided using the ST Micro TPA3255 chip.SY-DAP2002 MeasurementsI started my testing using stock con uration:Distortion is quite low at -95 dB however SINAD is way worse at just 72 dB indicating noise as the limiting factor  .  Don\\'t be confused by the -100 dB noise floor in FFT.  That is after some 35 dB of \"FFT gain.\"  The owner had warned me about the noise and indeed had gone ahead and purchased the recommended upgrade opamps, the LM 4562.  I took the top off and swapped both and performance indeed improved:Noise still dominates though so performance continues to be average:You can see the effect of noise in SNR tests:Here is the comparison of noise with no input signal with or without the op-amp upgrade:Frequency response is limited based on digitization and load dependency:Crosstalk was generally good but somewhat variable:Multitone test shows how low the distortion is, alas with high noise floor:Healthy amount of power is available before shut down:Because of aggressive protection circuit, I could not get to 1% THD to measure max or peak power.Good bit of power is available at 8 ohm indicating that the 4 ohm performance above is current limited:Transfer function is quite good for a switching amplifier:SY-DAP2002 TeardownOverall construction seems reasonably clean:Top row is the switching power supply which naturally has high-voltage rectified mains in it.  As such, I would have liked to see a routed slot in addition to existing isolation that exists on the PCB.  That would reduce the chances of arcing from high voltage side to the low voltage amplifier.Capacitors are lower grade as usual but at least all the ones I looked at are higher grade 105 degree C.  The heatsink is quite beefy for its size and seemed to do its job keeping the TPA3255 chip amp cool in my testing.  I am not sure the fan will do any good since it likely pushes air in but there are no vents to push air out.  High static pressure then reduces its effectiveness although likely it is better than nothing  .I did not like the Bluetooth antenna lead travelling from the front of the board to the mains side.  The noise from switching power supply may reduce Bluetooth range and at any rate, it is not a safe place for it should the lead come off and touch the high-voltage areas of the power supply.  The RCA cables could have been moved a bit up   and made room available for that in the low voltage section.I see no regulatory and safety certifications which is not good in mains powered gear.Overall, this is not nearly as bad as it could be.  ConclusionsGetting a DSP platform and top-flight chip amp and power supply in a small box takes good bit of effort.  Overall, this is not a bad platform but compromises are there with performance dropping below what the chip amp can do.  Personally I use DSP upstream so have no use for it in the amp in this con uration so the performance hit   is not good in my book.  But you can decide otherwise.I could have recommended the amp but seeing how I had to upgrade the op-amp to get good performance, I am going to pass. -',\n",
       " \" Rotel RB-1070 stereo power amplifier. It was released in early 2000. Can't find the cost then but I see it used for around $400 to $500.I have always found Rotels to be most attractively designed power amplifiers.  One look at that front panel and you immediately think of muscle and beauty in design.  Alas, the extruded aluminum in front which gives it that look, is cosmetic.  There are two others internally which do the job of cooling this classic AB design.  In use the heastsinks got pretty warm to touch to give it some air to breath.Not much news in the back other than nice inclusion of trigger input/output:Rotel RB-1070 MeasurementsThe unit warmed up nicely without its performance changing much:So let's see what our dashboard of 1 kHz tone does into 4 ohm load:The amp is about 2 dB more sensitive than usual which likely accentuates the power supply noise a bit.  I was able to reduce 60 Hz hum in one channel but not simultaneously in the other.  That is exceeded however by the power supply noise at 120 Hz and multiples.  SINAD is likely dominated by distortion to the tune of -80 dB.  This lands the RB-1070 slightly above average of all amplifiers tested:Despite the power supply noise, dynamic range is very good:Frequency response is excellent and spec compliant:Crosstalk is good:Multitone shows no frequency dependence which is nice:There is ample power available into 4 ohm:The response is quite odd in that it doesn't slope down.  Don't know if that is intentional, accidental or due to power supply caps aging, letting in more ripple as power goes up.Regardless, lots of power is available:Company only specs the power into 8 ohm at 130 watts.  It certainly delivers that:Putting aside noise floor which is rather high, the units transfer function is one of the best I have ever seen:Sadly there is a significant power on pop:ConclusionsAs one of my favorite   brands, I was very anxious to measure a Rotel amp, hoping it would not let me down.  Fortunately it did not.  No, the SINAD doesn't break new ground but the rest of the measurements are very good with plenty of power available.  It is a great choice for people wanting good amount of power in an attractive package with competent performance.I am going to recommend   Rotel RB-1070. ---As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   \",\n",
       " \" Outlaw Model 5000 five channel home theater amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by   drop shipped to me.  Despite the number of channels and power of each, the Model 5000 costs only US $649 though shipping adds fair bit to it.The shipping is expensive because this is thing is super heavy.  It is at the limit of what I can reasonably carry upstairs to my lab  :My back nearly got killed just rotating the darn thing in my photo booth:Sadly, as you see, there are no balanced XLR inputs.  You are given heavy binding posts though which is nice.Left and right channels are far apart which is the right away to do it as they, and the center channel get beat the most.  And is most logical layout in my book.In use the Model 5000 never complained, shut down or anything of the sort.  The heatsinks are below the top cover so you can't exactly feel their temps.  I would imagine it would shut down though if it got too hot.Not much else to talk about so let's get into the measurements.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Nice to see the gain at 29 dB which is the only recommended standard in the wild  .There is fair amount of mains hum and power supply noise.  I improved them a bit with messing with grounding but this is the nature of the beast when a linear power supply is used.Distortion is dominated by second harmonic which combined with noise and hum gives us a middle or the road SINAD:Speaking of noise, there is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and near full power:I like to see 96 dB or better at 5 watts to clear the dynamic range of the CD but we don't get there.  At full power though, we meet that target and a bit more in the good channel.Frequency response is basically flat in the audible band:Testing with my simulated speaker model did not change the response hardly at all:Crosstalk was good as it should be in modular amplifiers like this with independent amps:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important deal with any amplifier is its power versus distortion and noise so let's start with 8 ohm load:Nice to see the Outlaw 5000 completely outclass our NAD AVR both in much lower noise, distortion and available power.  The picture is almost the same with 4 ohm load although distortion rises:These are two channel tests.  Adding two more 4 ohm loads power drops a bit naturally:That is over 800 watts delivered into the load which is great.Back to two channel power, here is what we get with short bust   and more steady state -- both at 1% THD+N:The toughest test I run is power versus frequency while trying to achieve 0.1% THD+N. The amp has to deliver its output while being stressed the entire 3 to 4 minutes the test runs.  Many AVRs quit.  Not so with Outlaw 5000:As you see, it not only passed the 2 channel test, but also 4 channel.  A quick statistical analysis of my high-res music library shows highest peaks at 40 Hz and that is where the cursor is.  We are getting 252 watts at that frequency with two channels and 207 watts with four channels.  Yes, it is lower than 1 kHz peak I use in other graphs but still a lot of power.ConclusionsDespite its bargain price, the Outlaw Model 5000 is solidly built and delivers tons of power without complaining.  It provides a clear setup over the built-in amplifiers in home theater AVRs.  No, it doesn't deliver state of the art distortion and noise.  For that, you will have to pay a lot more money.  For what it is, it is very good and I am happy to recommend the Outlaw Model 5000. -\",\n",
       " ' Douk Audio H7 stereo class D desktop amplifier.   costs US $144.Right away we see differentiation in the form of the nice looking VU meter.  Not only that there is a control to set it sensitivity which is a must in my view. The backlight is nice and bright and goes well with that yellow/orange ring.  The case is machined aluminum so feels nice and heavy for its size.  The switches and controls are surprisingly robust and impart a feeling of quality.  In other words, this is in entirely different class compared to typical budget desktop amplifiers.  Surprised continue to the back side:Yes, we have real, full size XLR inputs!  Of course there is also RCA input but they also added a set of RCA outs.  I am assuming that is to connect subs and out but there is no internal filtering.The heart of the unit is TI\\'s TPA3255 single chip stereo class D amplifier with very lofty specs:Wide input range is provided. Included power supply is manageable with 32 volts output with 5 amps of current.  If you are going to drive higher impedance speakers and you want to go louder, you may want to up that to 48 volts.One negative which actually follows some \"high-end\" gear is dual volume controls.  Yes, to increase or lower the volume, you have to crank both of them. I would have wanted to see a single volume control with a balance knob.  As is, you can set them once and use an upstream DAC with its volume control  .  That is how I tested it by setting the gain to 29 dB and treating it as a power amplifier.  You can see the position of the volume controls in the picture for that gain setting.Douk Audio H7 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm load using XLR input:The SINAD of the good channel at 82 dB is above average for all amplifiers tested.  But for some reason the other channel   is distorting more which drags the average down some:Zooming in:Noise performance is quite good for class although short of the TI specs:As is typical of budget class D amplifiers, the frequency response varies with what load   you connect to it in treble region:This means you may hear brighter or softer sound depending on exact impedance of the speaker. Best to use EQ and tailor that to taste.Distortion is kept very low at 5 watts:The less good channel lost 1 bit here  .  So still quite good and more than enough for the application.Crosstalk is very good for any amplifier let alone a budget one:Let\\'s see how it does in power department starting with 4 ohm load:This is good bit of power and only gets better if we allow 1% THD:I ran this three times as I could not believe it breaking into 3 digit department!  200 watts out of this little box?  Granted, the test is short term but still, that is quite healthy.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally get less power:Note that most speakers are around 4 ohm in bass frequencies where most of the volume is so don\\'t go optimizing for this unless you know you have an 8 ohm speaker in that region.EDIT: forgot originally to post the power vs frequency:There is only a dB or so impact due to warm up   so I would just turn it on and use:Finally, there is likely to be some audible pop on both turn on and off:Kind of strange to see the blue channel die out that way.  This may have something to do with that channel also underperforming in the dashboard.I had no luck trying to test the H7 with my powercube reactive loadbox. It caused some kind of interference that would keep it from switching loads.  Will need to spend more time investigating what is going on.ConclusionsThe Douk H7 breaks new ground in multiple areas from nicely done VU meter, nice looking case, and very good measured performance.  The only issue is if you can live with dual volume controls.  I am happy to see such differentiation in this highly price sensitive and crowded market.I am going to recommend the Douk Audio H7 amplifier. ',\n",
       " \"  of a DIY combination of ICEpower 200AC and 200ASC in a Ghent audio case.  It was kindly supplied by a local member.  Total part cost is US $310.The case work is fine:I like the hefty power switch which also acts as protection circuit indicator.  Speaking of that, it is of nice variety that self-resets and doesn't require manual power cycling.The back panel sports far better connectors than you could get in any mass market amplifier:And of course balanced inputs.The internal amplification for one channel is provided by the ICEPower 200ASC which has an integrated switchmode power supply.  This in turn feeds power to the amplifier-only 200AC module.  Nice and clever!ICEpower 200AC MeasurementsLet's run our usual dashboard into 4 ohm:Having been spoiled by high performance class D amplifiers, this is somewhat of a letdown.  Distortion is dominated by third harmonic at around -78 dB which sets SINAD to the same rating.  Result is average performance among all amplifiers measured to date:Signal to noise ratio is good though:Frequency response is as well:Power into 4 ohm though show early rise of distortion:Disappointing to see performance be worse than some of the worst AVRs we have measured at the limit.  Same is true at 8 ohm:Even when we allow distortion to rise to 1%, we still don't get the rated 200 watt power:The power supply is the limiting factor likely.Sweeping the power range at different frequencies gives us very complex response:The lines going backward are caused by the amplifier going into temporary shutdown.  This is occurring at just 40 or so watts at 20 kHz!  Fortunately there is not much music power there but still, from engineering point of view, I like to see far cleaner and stable response.  In some cases SINAD is rising to below 50 dB at just 2 watts!ConclusionsAs usual, we have high efficiency and compact packaging of class D amplification here.  What we don't have is performance that matches or beats good class D amplifiers.  Of course the cost is much lower as well  .  So you have a trade off to make.  I am too much of a perfectionist to want to recommend this unit but depending on what you are using it for, it may be fine. -\",\n",
       " ' Emotiva BasX series A-500 five channel home theater amplifier. The A-500 costs US $529 which seems reasonable given the functionality and ratings.I can\\'t say that I find the A-500 attractive but is not ugly either:Here is the connectivity which sadly does not include balanced XLR connections:This is a Class AB amplifier with a rather larger toroidal transformer.  It is not overly heavy though which my back appreciated.The heatsinks end well below the top of the case so it was hard to judge how warm it got by touching the case.  A quick test with IR temperature sensor showed the heatsinks running around 50 degrees C.In use the A-500 never complained, shut down or go into thermal protection.  This is nice benefit over the delicate amplifiers in AVRs which if you look at them wrong, they go into protection/shut down.  Clearly this is much more robust solution.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts output:I was surprised by two things: large channel disparity with respect to distortion   and very high mains hum at 60 Hz.  No amount of playing with grounding fixed the latter which tells me the 60 Hz is probably induced from the transformer into the amplifier section.  The former, channel distortion parity varied with which channel you used.  Channels 1, 2 and 4 were very close and good.  Channels 3 and 5 lagged way behind.  The \"good channels\" had their SINAD actually dominated by that mains hum and power supply noise, not distortion  .   The situation was reversed for the \"bad channels.\"Averaging all the channels we get a middle of the road score:Signal to noise ratio reflected the above issue with a-weighting resulting in substantial improvement of SNR:Our threshold of heaving in low frequencies is quite high so this is not as big of a problem audibly as it is in measurements.Frequency response was very good, almost ruler flat in audible band and going beyond 100 kHz at -3 dB:Crosstalk between channels 1 and 4 were rather disappointing:It is closer to a $29 amplifier than our state of the art Benchmark AHB2.The meat of the review is power measurements versus distortion.  So let\\'s get into that at 8 ohms:Nice to see the massive improvement relative to a higher end AVR   but as soon as distortion takes over, that advantage is sadly lost.  We do get a few more watts though than our AVR.Here is the same measurement with 4 ohm load:Let\\'s sweep from 20 kHz to 20 Hz and see how much power we get with THD+N set to 0.1%  :We see a small drop in power at the extremes which is good.Some of you have been demanding that I work harder and measure performance with more than two channels.  So here you go:I could not get the amplifier to distort less than 0.1% with 4 channels regardless of output level. So I stepped that up to 0.2% to get the third graph.  I could have been watching a movie instead of running these extra tests so I hope you are happy!ConclusionsThe Emotiva BasX A-500 seems to be a decent shot at building a 5 channel amplifier for a very decent price.  Yes, it is a bit of a gamble how good each channel is, and how audible that mains hum can become.  Other than that, it is a definite step up very amplifiers in AVRs.Overall I can recommend the A-500 if you are on a budget and have a bad back stopping you from lifting something heavier. -As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.Do you work on weekends?

       " 'This is a review and abbreviated measurements of the Linn Majik DS-1 integrated streamer and amplification. It has been discontinued but back in 2010   when it was announced it was US $4,200.  I see a recent ebay sale for a bit over $1,000.The Linn is an attractive unit:The interesting bits are in the back:You have full suite of analog and digital inputs although given the age, USB input is lacking.  Roon remote is built into the networking which is very nice for an older device.  And of course you have full amplification in there for a single box solution.Streamer DAC Stereo MeasurementsSince there is line out, let\\'s use the Toslink input into its DAC and measure what comes out before the power amplifier:By today\\'s standard, this is definitely subpar with sum of distortion and noise relative to signal not close enough to beat the CD format:I tested streaming with Roon player and performance was identical which is good.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started testing the power amplifier by using the Toslink optical input first:We see sum total SINAD of 78 dB.  This obviously is NOT limited by the DAC as it produced 20 dB better performance.  Indeed switching to analog input we see that confirmed:As its, the DS-1 lies smack in the middle of rankings of all the amplifiers we have tested regardless of price  :I quickly ran a frequency response test using analog input and was quite surprised that it was not flat:Thinking it may be digitized, I switched to digital input with both 44.1 kHz and 96 kHz sampling:We see the same curve.  So unless there is some kind of EQ I don\\'t know about, it is sad to see such roll off.Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm:This is very little power for all but secondary use.  It naturally drops lower with 8 ohm load:And these are not \"good watts\" either given how early distortion takes over and flattens the curve and then swings up at clipping.ConclusionsIn 2010 this kind of functionality would have been advanced.  But today there are a range of streaming solutions with amps that retail in hundreds of dollars with much more power.  It is disappointing to see an engineering focused company like Linn target so low in power and noise and distortion.Anyway, even at $1000 I can\\'t recommend the Linn Majik DS-1.  That said, if you have one using it in a secondary location like bedroom, office, etc. would be fine. -',\n",
       " ' Behringer A800 Class D Stereo Amplifier. The A800 costs US $299 including free shipping from multiple sites.The member who loaned it me has done a youtube video of it which you can see by clicking on this link.Behringer has been in this game for a long time and it shows from high level of optimization of weight, size and robustness of the A800:The unit is quite shallow relative to its width. Standard gain controls are provided which go up to 30 dB  .  Nice set of LEDs show the output level including clipping indicators.  All amplifiers should come with such displays  .  I could do without the notches in the volume control though as they are fake   and made exact setting harder  .  Not a big deal though.Back panel shows nice set of connectivity:For my testing I focused on XLR input only and standard speaker banana connectors.The amp hardly radiates any heat and has no fan.  Given the pro application of these amps, I expect them to be robust and reliable.During measurements, the A800 provides high level of predictability and assuredness that I sometimes miss when testing switching amplifiers.  It only shut down once after fair bit of experimentation at full power.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a gain of 29 dB to deliver 5 watts into 4 ohm load:This performance is very close to the Behringer A500 which I reviewed before.   That amp though, generated much worse SINAD because of its non-switching power supply:Its distortion products are capped to -80 dB which is what we see in A800.   Eliminating those power supply components sharply improves SINAD which is relative to sum of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is \"OK:\"Don\\'t use it on sensitive speakers you may hear some hiss  .32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows early rise in distortion with frequency:Crosstalk is reasonable:Dual, 19+20 kHz tone shows very high level of intermodulation distortion as we saw in multitone test:Fortunately your music doesn\\'t have such high amplitude tones and threshold of hearing is high that I don\\'t think this is nearly as much of a problem for the ear as it is for the eye.Frequency Response MeasurementsThe necessary low pass filter is causing some peaking at 20 kHz to the tune of 0.5 dB:The above is with a resistive load.  I have been asked frequently how the amp performs with a real speaker.  Stereophile uses a simulated load of a 2-way speaker that was given to them by NHT.  I built a similar load based on schematic from Doug Self:Here is the impedance of my load versus frequency:My response is more damped in low frequency than what Doug Self and Stereophile show.  I will investigate this further but for now, it is close enough.  Here is the phase response:And Stereophile graph of the two:Using my simulated load this is what I get with A800 amplifier:As you see, there is hardly any difference.  Looking at stereophile graphs, they use highly zoomed version to show differences.  This is what happens when I do the same:So a bit of ringing becomes apparent but it is so small as to not be of any consequence.  Heaven knows your speakers are not anywhere close to this level of variation.I will test some of the other amplifiers I have with this load and see if it causes more variation.  As it is, resistive load is the same as complex one.Note that neither my load, nor stereophile\\'s are high power ones.  So I cannot plot full power graphs and such.  Above measurements were at 5 watts.Amplifier Power MeasurementsGoing back to our resistive load, we get this output with 4 ohms:The show starts well with A800 being much quieter than our premium brand NAD AVR.  But then distortion kicks in and we don\\'t do as well.  We get however tons of power nearly a quarter of a kilowatt.  Similar story holds for 8 ohm load:Still, that is a lot of power at 8 ohm leaving our AVR way back in the dust.Using 1% threshold for THD+N, we get more power naturally than my graphs above indicate:Left hand is short-term burst power, right side is long term.Thermal StabilityPerformance improved just a bit after 10 minutes of warm up at 5 watts:So you don\\'t have to leave it on for good performance.ConclusionsThe Behringer A800 does what pro amps try to do: provide solid, middle-of-the-road distortion and noise with tons of power in quiet and light package for little money.  The design is stable and better than the A500.  As such, I can recommend the A800 as an everyday amplifier. -',\n",
       " \" Wyred4Sound mINT integrated stereo amplifier and DAC.      costs US $1,499 from the company.  I see reviews dating back to 2013 so the box has been around for a while.The design goes with the rest of Wyred4Sound gear although in person looks less refined than I expect in this price range:The back panel shows some very good functionality such as triggers and home theater pass through:The overall package is small and convenient from that point of view.  It ran reasonably cool which was also nice.As I took this picture, I realized USB only goes up to 96 kHz which is the old school USB interfaces of the time.  Fortunately it is asynchronous which was novel at the time and could have been worse in the form of synchronous USB.Wyred4Sound mINT MeasurementsWhen I first powered on the unit, the measurements were low so to make sure it was not my setup, I took the time to route all cables separately tightened all the connections and performance seemingly improved.  But this morning I got up and thought maybe the box was warming up and changes had nothing to do with the wires so ran my standard warm-up test:Looks like my guess was correct.  The amp did not stabilize even after 7 minutes of running with load on.  I waited at least that long before I took the measurements you see below so represents the warmer side of things.  With amplifiers with both digital and analog inputs, I always have to determine which input is best which depends on topology of the amp.  So let's do that here, first using Aux In analog input:I tried hard to suppress that mains noise at 60 Hz but every change made it worse.  I then switched to USB input:Man, this is bad.  It should be a walk in the park to have  DAC that keeps up with an amp that has a SINAD of 77 dB but here we are, with one of the worst performances I have seen with digital input.  So let's continue with analog input for the rest of the tests starting with our SINAD rating:So below average and disappointing.  Even more disappointing is the high noise floor:Crosstalk is fine:Frequency response unfortunately shows variability which means the class D amp used doesn't use a feedback loop outside of its filter to remove that dependency:Assuming you have good high frequency sensitivity, this amplifier will sound different with different speakers.We see that distortion sets in early and rises a lot:Here is our peak and max power at 1% THD:Sweeping different frequencies shows reasonable response for a class D but not in general:ConclusionsI very much like the functionality of the mINT with cute small size.  Performance though is subpart and much better can be done than what we have here with discrete parts which may cost even less than this combo.So I can't recommend the Wyred4Sound mINT.  But if you are fond of the functionality, I am not going to chase you out of the room . \",\n",
       " \" Jeff Rowland 535 stereo   amplifier. I believe it costs US $5,900.If you are not familiar with Jeff Rowland, it is a high-end audio company, known for their gorgeous machining of their cases that imparts a 3-D look.  You can see that coming through the protective film which I chose to leave on:The unit is incredibly heavy for its small size.  The back panel shows the most unusual binding posts I have seen:Those big knobs rotate to tighten bar on two spade terminals.  The feel incredibly nice.  Alas, they don't mate with banana leads and I had to screw around to connect mine.The amplifier is said to be balanced throughout including input transformer which is made with wire from Cardas  .  Company only states that a switching power supply is used but says nothing about the rest of the functionality.  From my testing, it seems to be class D which would explain why the amp stayed completely cool to touch under testing as if it was never on!  The massive chunk of chassis aluminum is likely responsible for great thermal performance.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz dashboard at 5 watts into 4 ohm:Ah, this is disappointing.  Distortion peaks to -80 dB which sets SINAD at an average number of 77:This is way below stated of the art in switching amplifier design.  Company specs are similar by the way so this is representative performance as designed.Where specs don't match is in signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk curve usually gets worse with frequency   but here it is rather flat:Frequency response is very good with no indication of interaction with the load:Another shortfall from the spec is in power department:Letting distortion peak up to 1% still doesn't give us what the spec says:I don't know how they get to 500 watts unless it is at even higher distortion levels.As a way of comparison, let's see how the power curve looks like relative to noise and distortion of Hypex based NC400:We have slightly more power although the NC400 I tested had a shared power supply.  That aside, there is no comparison in noise and distortion department.  The 535 way underperforms the Hypex.Finally, here is an unfiltered output of the amplifier at 5 watts:We clearly see the switching waveform.  Attenuation is better than 30 dB which is more than a number of other amps I have tested so that is good.ConclusionsThe Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier has beautiful fit and finish.  And is solidly engineered to run cool and I am sure reliable as a result.  It produces good bit of power which should be able to drive many speakers to desired loudness.  Alas, it reinvents the wheel and makes it less round.  Any amplifier based on Hypex modules will have as much or more power with far less noise and distortion and lower cost.Bottom line, I can't recommend the Jeff Rowland 535 due to its high cost and average noise and distortion. \",\n",

Tone controls are not centered however for flat response  . Typical of these budget amplifiers, power is provided externally through a switching supply:Binding posts are spaced out a bit more which made it easier for me to plug in my large cables.This is a class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 single chip amplifier.Fosi Audio TB10D MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watts measurement of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:Dominant distortion is third harmonic which essentially sets SINAD to same level. This is slightly below average but considering the price of this amp, it is reasonable:Kind of interesting that the $5,900 Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier lands almost next to it!Signal to noise ratio is modest but again, good for the class:Crosstalk holds its own against much more expensive amplifiers:Frequency response is variable due to bass and treble control and load dependency:The load dependency is the norm in this class.  Hopefully some amp comes along and with no cost penalty takes care of that  .Distortion rises with frequency which we can see in multitone test:Power is everything in amplifiers so let\\'s see how much we have:This is quite healthy for such a small and low cost amplifier!  It gets even better if we allow 1% distortion:We are talking essentially 200 watts coming out of this little box!  Cost per watt is just 35 cents.  Amazing.Even with 8 ohm load we get good amount of juice:Amplifier \"transfer function\"   is very good for class D although it does show rise in distortion as noted earlier:Of note, you still have 66 watts of power at 20 Hz.  Many budget amps drop to 20 or so watts which can be problem as bass is what requires power.ConclusionsMaybe one day this will change for for now, in under $100 range you can\\'t expect perfection in performance of a stereo amplifier.  What you do want to see is delivering healthy amount of power with close to our average of all of our amplifiers tested to date.  On that front, the Fosi Audio TB10D delivers. If you need an amplifier for secondary use  , the TB10D is a very good candidate for no more money than one or two dinners!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio TB10D amplifier. ',\n",
       " ' SMSL A100 A100 stereo amplifier.   a member. I can\\'t find it on sale anywhere but seems to have cost US 100.I like the simply but rather elegant/symmetrical design.  Same for thoughtful rear connections:Almost every manufacturer puts both speaker outputs together making it so hard to plug in the banana plugs. Here they are spaced apart which essentially solved that problem. Inclusion of an AC power supply is unheard of in this price class and nicely declutters your desk.Oddly the USB input is type A.  At first I thought this was for external storage but manual talks about using this with a computer.  I didn\\'t have a type A to type A cable so didn\\'t test this and stuck with Aux analog input.The heart of the unit is Infineon MA12070 class D amplifier.SMSL A100 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Distortion is actually better than 90 dB but there is rising level of noise and high order spikes which drag it down to 76 dB.  This puts is slightly below average:Edit:Request was made to measure using USB input.  I had to use a special breakout box to interface to the unit given its type A connector.  Here is the dashboard:As you see, performance is degrade fair bit.  My breakout may be causing some clock jitter but then again, if async USB is implemented, this should not be the case.Noise performance is \"OK:\"Multitone shows the same problem at high frequencies:I expected frequency response to have load dependency but thankfully, it did not:What ringing it has is above audible band which is good.Crosstalk is very good, beating some home amplifiers:Power output is naturally modest:Sensitivity to high frequency input becomes very clear as we do power sweeps:Unit didn\\'t need any warm up.ConclusionsThe message here is a sum of good and not so good.  I really like the frequency response for a class D amplifier and inclusion of AC power supply.  Distortion on the other hand rises with frequency.  I like to see perfection but we don\\'t have such an example below $350 currently.  Overall I would say not a bad attempt.  Strange that despite having become available late last year, it is discontinued already.  Maybe there are part shortages.I am going to recommend the SMSL A100 as a budget amplifier. ---As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   ',\n",
       " \"  of BasX A-100 Class AB amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by   drop shipped to me for testing.  The A-100 costs US $229 from the company direct.I must stay, this is one gorgeous looking and nicely feeling amplifier:This is a deep cabinet ending in the terminals in the back:As you see it has trigger capability.  Not a fan of the  ure 8 AC mains cable as I have very few of them.  Best to not lose it.There is a fan on top but I did not hear it come on.  The unit does get quite warm though so allow ample cooling/space above it.Emotiva BasX A-100 MeasurementsAnother member had contacted me asking me if I could test if the unit was distorted while cold.  I had stopped testing for this since the warm up effect has been so minimal.  Not so here:You see what I am seeing?  12 dB improvement in distortion after 5 minutes???  I am assuming bias is not optimal while cold but why? Temperature compensation is quite cheap and has been part of design of amplifiers forever.Anyway, here is our usual dashboard:Not happy about the channel gain difference.  As it is, performance is a bit below average:I like to see a dynamic range at 5 watt approaching 96 dB and we are fair bit short of that:Frequency response is flat enough:Crosstalk is pretty good for a budget amp:Here is the multitone:Power versus distortion+noise is good:If we allow 1% THD, we get the power spec from the company:Distortion characteristic has a simple relationship with frequency and that is it:ConclusionI really like the packaging and price of this amplifier.  While overall performance is good, having to wait 6 minutes before it stabilizes is just not acceptable.  I would be tempted to buy this and mod it to make it temperature stable.As is, I can't recommend the Emotiva BasX A-100 amplifier. -\",\n",
       " ' Argon SA1 integrated amplifier with phono input and Bluetooth. It is on kind from a European member and costs €369.I have a soft spot for white audio electronics and the SA1 goes right after that!  Quite elegant. What I didn\\'t like is the lack of indication on the file LEDs which indicate inputs. The volume control is digital  . Pushing it selects the input.  The LEDs also blink for other reasons I did not try to  ure out. Here is the  back panel:It was odd to see just a type A USB that is indicated as USB power.  There should be proper USB input in this day and age. There is pre-out but in my testing, I found that the volume control did not adjust it when using digital input but did with phono. Maybe this was operator error, I don\\'t know as only a single half-sheet of instructions is provided with the unit.The unit as shipped is for 50 Hz/250 volt so I used my lab AC generator to power it.  Specifications say \"40 watts\" of power so thought my 300 VA lab supply is enough.  As it turns out, it was not.  See the measurement section.FYI, there is a very clos cousin of this unit from NAD in the form of AMP1. I could not find either for sale in US.  The AMP1 lacks Bluetooth I believe but has Chromecast built in  .  It is not clear who built this unit.  Likely it is an OEM for both.Argon SA1 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit Toslink and measured from the pre-out.  The output was severely clipped.  So I brought the input level down -12 dB to our nominal 2 volts and no clipping:This lands the unit in the middle of our \"fair\" category:I like to see a SINAD of over 100 dB for this class product and we are good few dBs short here. Here is the response sweep of digital input levels:Our dynamic range is just \"OK:\"At this point, the picture of the DAC performance is clear so I thought I cut to the chase and measure the amplifier.Argon SA1 Amplifier MeasurementsWith amplifiers that have both analog input and digital, I start by testing both to see which is more transparent and run with that.  Here is analog input:This is not a happy picture with rising low frequency noise and distortion that is just below -80 dB.  Let\\'s try Toslink input:Ah, that is much better.  The combination of noise and distortion is well above average now:So let\\'s continue with Toslink input starting with our SNR:We are a few dBs short of my 96 dB requirement for 5 watts but 88 dB is not so bad. I expected crosstalk to be better given the digital input:Frequency response shows some load dependency in this Class D amplifier but better than many with this problem:Let\\'s see how much power we have starting with 4 ohm load:Multitone performance is good:I could not get to clipping range as my AC lab supply would shut down.  So likely there is more power to be had as you can see in this dynamic test:I did have enough juice to run the 8 ohm test:In both cases the SA1 beats the ARCAM AVR10 in noise which is good.Argon SA1 Phono MeasurementsThere was tremendous amount of mains interference in the phono stage dashboard.  I am not going to show that as it may be due to use of my lab supply.  But here is the all important RIAA equalization:It seems to be a little heavy handed in upper bass with a rumble filter built-in.  Not bad but not perfect either.ConclusionsI really like the way the SA1 looks.  But looks can\\'t get me over \"checklist\" DAC performance of around 16 bits.  The analog input on the amp doesn\\'t perform well but digital does.  Overall I have mixed feelings on the unit so not going to pass judgement one way or the other.  I let you all do that by answering the poll. ',\n",
       " ' Crown XLS 1502 \"PA\" Power Amplifier.  It is on a kind loan from a member who bought it new and drop shipped it to me.  It retails for USD $349 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.  At that price, it seems like an incredible value.I have to say, while the unit looks industrial/military, it does not at all feel cheap.  As expected it comes in 19 inch rack mount con uration but very shallow:Not only do you get a high power amplifier with front graphical display and such, but also a built-in DSP.  It is not a fancy subsystem but allows you to dial in crossovers and such which is very handy in live sound.   At may company   we use a ton of Crown amps not for hifi applications but for music distribution in the home.  The built-in DSPs come in handy for limiting the frequency range, max output, etc..Unlike home units, the XLS 1502 has a built-in fan with tons of holes for ventilation as you see.  Fortunately it is temperature controlled and barely came on during my nearly 50 watt soak time.  And when it came on, it was very quiet.Here are the guts of the unit  :Man, is this clean!  Look at the beefy mains chokes to keep noise at bay.  The power supply is integrated on the same board as the power amplifier so you can\\'t swap one to fix the unit although at these prices, getting a new unit is more economical anyway.  The fan is placed not only in front of the heatsinks for the power transistors but also the output filter inductors which is nice as far as keeping them cool too.I noticed that the output stage is depopulated.  Seems then that the step up model just has a few more parts in it and that is that:There are tons of connectors in the back which I let you read about elsewhere.  Overall, this is jaw droppingly nice unit and unbelievable at the price that is being charged.I did a lot of searching and was surprised that there were no measurements of these units.  A lot of empty reviews, yes.  But no measurements.  So you get to have an exclusive set of data in this review!    So let\\'s get into that.MeasurementsI started by cooking the unit for a while at 48 watts with kind permission from its owner:Unlike some other amps, bringing the unit up to temp ever so slightly worsens performance.  There are also some interesting thermal effects from time to time represented by the spikes.  Anyone who thinks they can predict what thousands of components do as they warm up should get into predicting the weather on tuesday next week, 10 years from now!  Anyway, let\\'s look at our dashboard at 5 watts of output:Sorry I did not set the reference in the FFT.  But the news is there in the SINAD   of just 75 dB.  We have seen worse but also much, much better.  Gain is about 30 dB by the way.Signal to noise ratio is decent but again, nothing high-end about it:Let\\'s look at power versus distortion+noise:So we see that the Crown XLS 1502 easily outperforms the no-name Chinese class D amp we recently tested  .  It has a well behaved response with sloping down curve and then onset of clipping.  Power was around 336 watts @ 0.008% distortion.  I say \"around\" as there are not enough points in these measurements to find the exact onset of clipping.  The number is therefore a bit understated.  Crown specs the unit at 525 watts though at 4 ohm and we are not going to get there without a lot of distortion.The hypex Hyped DIY Nc400 amplifier far outperforms the XLS 1502.  It has far lower noise and distortion although not as much power before clipping.  It costs nearly four times as much though.I thought I do a comparison against the Behringer A500.  The A500 feels a lot more cheaply made but is also priced at $199:We see that the Crown XLS 1502 is better in every regard with lower noise and much more usable power before clipping.I thought the continuous power would be a walk in the part for the XLS 1502 but did present a surprise:The red \"thermal\" light came on the front panel but instead of shutting down, the power was reduced a bit.  \"The show must go on\" seems to be the rule here and nice to see instead of full shutdown we saw with Hypex Nc400.   As you see, I let the unit keep going and it went to 8+ minute maintaining that status.Frequency response was surprising but easily explainable:We have a \"brickwall\" style filter which indicates our analog input is digitized first through an ADC running at 48 kHz sampling, processed through DSP  , and then converted back to analog before amplification. Both the ADC and DAC therefore sharply limit the bandwidth to 48 kHz.  I was surprised to see some roll off at 20 Hz too.Wideband FFT   as usual shows a lot of activity in higher frequencies:The first peak is very nicely truncated at a little less than 100 kHz to pass emissions standards  .  Crown class I devices interleave the output stages which would explain the energy spread over four quadrants at multiples of that ~100 kHz pulses.  Since the XLS 1502 has passed emissions standards I would not worry too much about them.ConclusionsIt is hard to fathom that a properly engineered and produced mainstream brand amplifier with so much power can be sold for so little money.  This is a robust but bargain amplifier designed for heavy punishment in live sound.  Can it be used for hi-fi use?  Sure but it will severely limit both the resolution and potentially bandwidth of upstream sources.  Its best use would be as a subwoofer amplifier.  If you need an all in one unit, Hypex NC400/NC500 designs are so far my choice among amplifiers tested. --',\n",
       " ' Outlaw Model 7140, seven   channel home theater power amplifier. The 7140 seems to have come out a few years ago and is shown as discontinued.  At the time it was out, the cost was a reasonable US $1,100.  The new replacement series, 7000X looks just like this so not sure what they have changed.The 7140 is a beast of an amplifier, nearly breaking my back carrying it up to my lab:The design is highly modular with a massive toroidal transformer powering 7 independent amplifiers, each with their own power supply on board.  The heatsinks are rather beefy with plenty of distance between them and top of the unit.  The feet are also quite tall allowing better ventilation from bottom to top.The back panel shows the inclusion of XLR inputs which I appreciate:The inclusion of a grounding terminal was interesting.   It did no good in my testing with XLR inputs as it should not.During use, the 7140 was quite stable, never complaining, shutting down or anything as Audio/Video Receivers   tend to do.  Clearly then this is a more robust solution than internal amps in those units.Power Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard view of 5 watts into 4 ohm load using a 1 kHz tone:I was surprised to see such high mains hum at 60 Hz.  A prior review of another unit with just RCAs complained about the same thing and recommended a ground terminal on the unit which they have added.  But as I mentioned, it made no difference.  I have to think this is magnetically coupled into the amplifiers.Fortunately or unfortunately the distortion spike from 2nd harmonic is bit higher still so didn\\'t impact measured SINAD  .  As it is, the 7140 lands below the average for all the amplifiers we have reviewed so far:Frequency response is flat enough:32-tone signal to resemble \"music\" shows the typical rise of distortion with frequency:And rather high noise floor which could be caused by that power supply hum.Here are the noise  ures for 5 watt and full power:We are not clearly more than 14 bits or so at 5 watts so not very quiet.Here is our power versus distortion and noise at 8 ohm:We see the elevated noise and distortion relative to our reference amplifier.  Power produced is right on the money at 146 watts.Here is the same at 4 ohm:The above tests are at 1 kHz.  Here is what happens when we sweep the frequencies, aiming to measure power at 1% THD+NQuite a drop in power with both loads when we get down to 20 Hz.  The power supply capacitors are likely too small to keep up with the slow rate of change at low frequencies.We see a similar view when we look at sweeps at different frequencies:Finally, some people like to see intermodulation distortion of 19 + 20 kHz tones so here it is at max power:ConclusionsThe Outlaw Model 7140 has a very sturdy build.  It produces good power per specifications provided from manufacturer  .  The down side is too much ground/mains leakage and distortion+noise that is slightly below average.  Paying more   will get you sharp reduction of such problems.For typical home theater duty, the 7140 should do the job fine.  It just isn\\'t something to get excited about from pure performance point of view. -',\n",
       " \" Sound Town ST-UPDM4C four   channel professional amplifier. It was purchased new by   drop shipped to me. It costs US $540.As you see, there is a bit of style to this amp with the front panel.  This is a straight amplifier with no DSP:The fans came on immediately and made moderate amount of noise  .  As you see, input is XLR and output is speakon connectors.I was very pleased to see Audio Precision analyzer graphs in the manual.  They were quite tiny and hard to read but made me hope that the design was verified through such.Sound Town ST-UPDM4C MeasurementsThe tests you see are all performed using Channels 1 & 2 on one side.  Let's start with our dashboard:SINAD is below average of all amplifiers tested by 4 dB but for a Pro amplifier, it is not bad:But there is more going on here.  There is broad set of noise between 2 and 4 kHz.  I shut off the signal feed to it and was very surprised to find this noise component:Seems like some square wave with harmonics buzzing around internally that is bleeding into the amplifier.  Not good.That noise limited the signal to noise ratio:It also showed up in multitone test:Notice how the ends of the spectrum has reduced levels which indicates non-flat frequency response:Not only do we have   load impedance dependency but we are missing the lows as well below 40 Hz or so.  As such, you can't use this amplifier for subwoofer duty.Amplifier is rated at huge wattage so I was shocked to see so little output with 4 ohm load:I am used to seeing power exaggeration in pro amplifier specs but this is in entirely different class.Strangely, I got identical amount of power into 8 ohm load:Is there some kind of limiter in the unit?  There must be.  See what happens when I change frequencies:See how the curve goes up but then starts to go backward below 1 kHz?  That is electronic limiter in action.  Finally crosstalk was very poor:ConclusionI have hardly seen any audio device show issues in every test I run but here we are.  I don't understand what is going on here.  How can they have analyzed the performance using AP yet have so many issues left on the table?  Did they design change post those measurements?  This is the frequency response from the manual:It shows flat response to 20 Hz.  Notice the date is 2003.  Is it really that old of a design?Anyway, I can't recommend the Sound Town ST-UPDM4C.  \",\n",
       " ' PS Audio Sprout100 integrated DAC, headphone and power amplifier. The Sprout100 is an upgrade over the original Sprout and costs USD $599.I remember the first time I saw the Sprout at an audio show.  I thought it was utterly cute!  It is small and handsome little package with a ton of functionality:As you see, in addition to functions I mentioned, it even has Bluetooth included.  And moving magnet turntable input.  It is a dream product for a frustrated marketing guy in a high-end audio company like PS Audio, wanting mass market product that appeals to the \"younger audience.\" The volume control is a rotary encoder with a built-in switch that powers the unit on and off.  If you hold the button down, the LED color changes from purple to white, indicating bass boost is on.  The rotary encoder is poorly programmed to have linear and slow response, making it very, very slow to change volume.  To go from low to high volume you may have to turn it seven or eight times!  We live in a digital age with music that is fast to access and comes at all levels.  Having the ability to quickly change volume is important.Input selection is old school mechanical selector.  I like the clear labels.The backside shows how much is crammed in there:I did not test sub out but it has sensor that automatically activates that output  .In addition to USB input, we also have toslink optical which is nice in case of ground loops.The nicest bit is included power supply in such a small package.  Kudos for managing to fit that in there and reduce clutter.There is protection circuit for both power amplifier and headphone.  During testing I found it to frequently activate which simply turns off the unit.  It caused a lot of head scratching until I discovered the latter action.It is also I think underdesigned from cooling perspective.  When I started my DAC testing, I had the dummy load connected to the unit as well.  After a few minutes of testing I noticed the signal went away.  Then I realized per above it had shut down.  Went to touch the power button and it was hot as heck.  As was the rest of the enclosure which was super hot.  Even the top \"wood\" panel was hot to touch.   I would not rely on the 100 watt rating into 4 ohm to be a continuous rating for any length of time.The Sprout100 is rated at 100 watts into 4 ohm and according to PS Audio uses ICEPower modules.I should tell you that I hate testing multi-function devices like this.   Every subsystem takes as much time as reviewing another product with just that functionality.  In the interest of getting the review done, I did not bother to test the Vinyl input.  I also did not touch the sub out or toslink.DAC MeasurementsThe inclusion of line out allows us to test the DAC subsystem independently so let\\'s start with our dashboard there:The output was variable so I adjusted it to 2 volt.  Per my review notes above, the power amplifier was on and was whaling away into the dummy load at the same time.PS Audio rates Sprout100 as having less than 0.01% THD+N distortion from line out.  We are beating that although that is such a low bar.  Equivalent rating in SINAD   puts the Sprout100 in our bottom quarter of DACs reviewed:Not a good place to be although probably fits the performance target they created for themselves for \"lifestyle product\" like this.Back to our THD+N rating, we can separate the components of distortion and noise and get this ratio:They are both contributing to the final THD+N but the noise is a bit more dominant.  Likely in this small enclosure the could not get enough isolation for the DAC subsystem to reduce noise levels.The high noise level makes the jitter graph \"pretty\" with almost no spikes visible but that is because the noise floor is so elevated:Best in class DACs put that noise floor down to the bottom of the graph.Same noise problem manifests itself hugely in linearity test:That smooth, exponential rise indicates random noise polluting the voltage reading at each level.  Noise-free performance then stops around 80 dB or 13 bits -- quit a bit shy of 16 bit performance of CD.  In this day and age, I like any DAC to at least do justice to CD format, bringing fully transparency to 96 dB.Intermodulation test shows similar higher noise floor but also pretty early rising of distortion levels:Similar story for THD+N versus frequency:Dynamic range of the DAC is as spec\\'d:Speaker Amplifier MeasurementsNote: all amplifier testing except when noted, is with an AUX-0040 Audio Precision filter in place to reduce high frequency components given the fact that this is a switching amplifier design.As usual, for amplifiers I test with 5 watt output.  The trick is to know what to use for input level and volume control.  With digital input that was easy as I set the level to 0 dBFS.  But then I thought we want to know the performance of the amp alone so we better test with analog input and here is what I got:With digital input I could get over 80 dB by the way.  But no combination of input and volume level could get us there with analog input.  In some sense then the amplifier is good enough for the performance of the DAC.Frequency response showed different response in each channel:I swapped my loads and the curve did not change, indicating that the variation is due to the amplifier   design, not differences in my loads.  Clearly the channel in blue is resonating around 50 kHz, causing that large boost of nearly 20 dB!  What you get with your speaker load and its wiring is unknown.  The red channel is more behaved.  We saw the same discrepancy between channels in the SINAD in the dashboard.Poking our noise into the design using high-bandwidth spectrum   analysis, we see this:Note that this is a raw test with the external filter removed.  We clearly see the switching frequency around 600 kHz peaking up to almost -20 dB.  You can have your own AM station if you like.    We have an early rise in noise before 100 kHz which is due to some kind of noise shaping.  There are a lot of other spikes which one could examine to see what is going on but I am too lazy to do so.  Regardless, these amplifiers are not pretty to look at as far as performance above audible band.  It is the price you pay for having 100 watt/channel amplifier squeezed into a little box.Speaking of power, let\\'s measure that into 4 ohm load:We get 82 watts with both channels driven which is shy of the 100 watt specification.  Noise and distortion is lower than Topping TP60   amplifier.  And there is more power.Signal to noise ratio is \"OK\":Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s jump right in with power versus distortion and noise at 300 ohms:We have competent level of power but much more noise and distortion than our reference Topping DX3 Pro  .  I like to see at least 100 milliwatts here and the Sprout100 delivers.Here is the picture at 33 ohm:We have 420 milliwatts of power until the Sprout100 shuts down causing the graph to shoot back to the left.  In other words, the unit is distortionless until it shuts down.Output impedance is a bit high at 5.7 ohms:Headphone Listening TestI started my testing with Sennheiser HD-650.  There was enough power there for a very good experience.  I could not detect any onset of distortion.Switching to Hifiman HE-400i, I got a bit more power and again, clarity and power until the end.Dedicated headphone amplifiers will produce more power but there was enough here with either headphone to give a bit of tingling to my ear lobes during bass so I was happy.  I could not get the Sprout100 to shut down with the HE-400i so in practice this may not be a serious problem.ConclusionThe reviews I read prior to testing the Sprout100 all point to how great it is that a \"high-end\" company like PS Audio has produced such a mass market product.  And that this association must be translating into excellent sound.  Our objective measurements show that this is not the case.  Performance of such subsystem as the DAC and headphone amplifier is nothing to write home about. Subjective aspects though are good: lots of power from the headphone amp and to some extent, from the power amplifier.The miss from usability is the super slow to change volume control.  In many cases I could move it a notch and nothing would happen to the output in my analyzer let alone the ears.So where do we land?  From objective performance I can\\'t say that the Sprout100 lives up to the promise of the brand.  From full functionality point of view at $599 it seems to be there though although I have yet to test many products in this category.  For this reason, I am going to withhold giving or holding back a recommendation.  Let the data guide you in that regard. -',\n",
       " \" Crown XLS 1002 rack mounted pro amplifier.      drop shipped to me.  The 1002 costs US $339 including Prime shipping from Amazon.Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman and hence Crown products.  We use fair bit of Crown amps in custom installs usually to power in-ceiling speakers and such.  Member wanted to buy it through us but the margin on it was no more than a cup of coffee   so I suggested he buy it elsewhere which he did.Not sure what to say about the look other than it is made to have some style while being rugged:The LCD with bluish backlight reminds me of displays on electronics back in 1980s.  I guess at this price they had to cut every penny.I was relieved to see binding posts besides speakon connectors:Now don't laugh but I could not  ure out how to pull out the safety plugs they put in the darn binding posts!  There is no way to grab then and I did not want to put a mark on them by using a sharp tool.  The manual says only European units have it but clearly that is not correct.  Anyway, I resorted to using the SpeakOn connectors for my testing.  For input I focused on XLR inputs.I set the gain to max to get the nominal 29 dB I have standardized on for testing amplifiers.There is a fan in the back and some inside.  But none came on that I could hear above the sound of my PC during testing.  Nothing shut down even when the amp was pushed into clipping.  Some kind of limiter would kick in after short period to keep the power level at max.  Temperature of the case didn't even rise above room temp.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsPerformance was stable during a 5 minute warm up time so I ran with them:Strange to see higher order harmonics dominating the distortion profile  .  Ratio of noise+distortion to signal as expressed in SINAD is what I expect decent pro amps to produce:Slightly below the average of all amps tested.Signal to noise ratio is in the same range:Crosstalk is reasonable:Frequency response test shows that everything is digitized due to inclusion of DSP functionality in this amp:Power into 4 ohm is healthy as is the case with most pro amps:I was disappointed to see one channel be much worse than the other though.Letting distortion go higher we get higher power output:The burst/peak power is not higher because of the limiter I mentioned in the intro.Using 8 ohm load gives a more behaved response than 4:This indicates the one channel is starving for current than the other  .I was unhappy to see distortion shoot up at higher frequencies:Fortunately in practice there is not much energy up there so you will be operating in low wattage area where distortion is quite a bit lower.Finally, I removed my AES filter to get the spectrum:Switching frequency is around 380 kHz and decently attenuated.ConclusionsCompetent pro amplifiers target for good enough noise and distortion.  The Crown XLS 1002 falls in that category so if you were expecting to have anything better for so little money and so much power, you would be disappointed.  But otherwise the amp does what it targets to do.I am going to put the Crown XLS1002 on my recommended list for non-critical applications or for driving subwoofers and such. -\",\n",
       " ' Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 Stereo Class D power amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by   costs US $799  .The GaN 5 comes in a compact enclosure with plenty of ventilation at the cost of decent looks:Beside the sole power button and blue indicator, there are two red LEDs that turn on when you power the unit on and then go off.  Strangely, when the amplifier goes into protection, they do not light up and getting the unit working again requires a power cycle.  I like to see protection circuits that self recover when the extreme condition goes away.The back panel shows binding posts that are too close together for easy fitment of my large banana speaker cables.  But I like the inclusion of balanced XLR inputs:As you see, there are also jumpers to change the gain setting although the range is not very large  .  Most of my testing was with medium gain which is as shipped.I had trouble getting the amplifier to function initially.  It would simply not output anything.  I played with grounding as I have seen some very low end amps cause AP to not be able to capture their output due to high level of noise  .  This didn\\'t work at first so I switched inputs to RCA.  That did not work either.  After some fiddling and switching back to balanced input, the amp all of a sudden started to work.  Not sure how much of this is interaction with Audio Precision or design issue.  Either way, it is an exception to the rule of 95% of amplifiers I have measured.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses the new Gallium Nitride transistors   which has some advantages over classic Mosfet transistors.  All else being equal, it can produce higher efficiency and better performance at expense of higher cost.Mini GaN 5 MeasurementsAs noted, I started my testing in medium gain which produced near nominal 29 dB which is my standard for amplifiers.  XLR input was used per introduction:Well, this is disappointing.  Distortion is fairly high causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion+noise to be worse than a number of budget desktop amplifiers:Noise performance by itself is not good either:I had trouble getting the amplifier to go to full power for the right graph.  It would shut down at just 0.7 volt input. Strangely, later on it accepted higher levels of input.  I think the impulse nature of this measurement was causing it trouble.  So maybe it can produce higher SNR at higher power but still, none of this is competitive.On the other hand, crosstalk was very good:Multitone performance was also reasonable:What is not reasonable is high dependence on speaker load when it comes to frequency response:This is just not proper.  Clearly the output filter is interacting with the load.Power measurements were quite puzzling:Notice the pull back due to some protection kicking in, likely the power supply rather than the amplifier.  I could not remotely get the power rating they specify using medium gain.  I thought maybe low gain does better but then the pull back occurred at even low power  !  Beside lack of power, distortion is also quite high for this price class and category.  We are talking about poor Audio/Video Receiver amplifier performance!Switching to 8 ohm tamed the output a bit but power shortfall is still significant:This being the second amplifier I have recently tested with such power shortfall, I started to doubt my instrumentation.  So I pulled out my Purifi reference design and measured it.  It tracked the dashed line in the above graph from a year ago 100%.  Someone had posted this from their website:600 watts per channel??? Into 8 ohm?  This is the spec from the manual:How on earth did they measure 600 watts when the spec is 200 watts?  Strangely, that graph is nowhere to be found on their site.  There is some talk about a larger amplifier of which is a shrunk version?  Maybe that is the one that produced higher power but why does it say \"mini\" in the title of above graph?FYI, this amplifier has the green board which I understand to be the newer design.  Maybe the older red one had more power.  Hard to say.Anyway, I tried to run my max and burst power:In Burst mode, the amplifier would keep going into pull back and so I could not compute anything for that.  Likewise the THD+N vs frequency and power could not be run.  As the frequencies got lower and lower, the point where the amp would pull back would also shrink to lower and lower wattages.   What I could get did not show great transfer function.ConclusionsWhile I leave the door ever so slightly ajar to some interaction with Audio Precision, the measurements seem to indicate an amplifier that has both design issues and inability to meet specifications.  The fact that the company took away the only measurement graph makes it suspect that maybe they had have modified the design and selling something different than what they originally intended.  As it is, it is a waste of GaN technology as it brings nothing to the party but high expense.I can\\'t recommend the Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 amplifier. ',\n",
       " ' \"upgraded\" TPA3221 chip based AIYIMA A05 integrated amplifier.      costs US $80 from Amazon including Prime shipping.For a budget amplifier, the controls feel nice:As you see, tone controls are provided.  Alas, there is no detent or switch for flat response.  If you center them, you actually get too much bass.  I had to adjust them using iterative measurements to settings you see in the picture above for flat response  .A giant external power supply providing 32 volts is included which dwarfs the size of the unit itself:I dislike these little speaker terminals but they are very common in this price class.  They are too close to each other to connect beefy locking banana connectors I use for testing.Bluetooth is provided which I did not test.In use, the unit never even got warm so efficiency must be quite high.  Or else, the heat is not transmitted to the case.AIYIMA A05 MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:SINAD is dominated by distortion and ranks below average of all the amplifiers tested to date:Still, for this price and category, I think this is pretty good.Signal to noise ratio becomes good at full power:Crosstalk is decent as well:Here is our frequency response with my adjustments of the tone control:As you see we get a typical peaking of the response when I change impedance to 8 ohm.  This is due to the filter in the class D amplifier interacting with the load.  Fortunately you have tone controls here so you can compensate for it.Multitone shows best performance in mid frequencies which is a good thing compared to the alternative:Let\\'s see how much power the A05 can produce into 4 ohm load:This is much more than I expected.  We get decent amount of power even with 8 ohm:Above is with 1 kHz.  Let\\'s see how it does when we vary that:Not pretty at either high frequencies or very low.  As noted, mid frequencies do well which is good as that is where we are most sensitive.  ConclusionsGetting decent amount of power and low distortion and noise is hard in ultra low price category but the AIYIMA A05 gets there.  So I decided to grade it on a curve and give it my recommendation. -',\n",
       " ' Monoprice 150 watt \"605030\" rack mountable \"pro\" stereo amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing.  The 605030 costs just US $119 from Amazon including Prime shipping which is remarkably low.From a distance the unit looks like any other pro, R1U amplifier:It looks rather cheap an unattractive to me but hard to imagine any pro amp getting some kind of design award for their looks.Two gain controls are provided in the front which I appreciated.  For testing I aspire for gain of 29 dB and I almost got there at max level as shown.  That is how   unit.  There overload indicators which was niceWhat I did not like one bit was the rather loud fan which runs continuously.  Monoprice, please take another $5 from me and make the fan temperature dependent please!Seeing balanced input in any amplifier at $115 price range is incredible but that is what we have here:Output is provided in the form of SpeakOn and mono 1/4 inch sockets.  Neither is convenient for in-home use but you can deal with it as I did.The loud fan did have one benefit: the amp never changed temps above the room after all my tests.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI powered on the unit and ran the dashboard and was immediately disappointed with the very high distortion:I checked all of my connections and distortion persisted.  I almost didn\\'t run the rest of my tests but decided to do anyway.  As another 5 to 10 minutes passed, I noticed the performance had improved so I went back and re-measured the dashboard again:I have never seen an amplifier improve by 11 dB after brief warm up.  Some kind of thermal compensation is left out to save money I guess.  If the fan was not running, you could leave it running all the time but with the fan, I certainly would not.  Anyway, the ranking is still below average but at least not in the broken category:Frequency response shows anomalies in the filtering of the switching design:Depending on your speaker and its impedance, you may get accentuated highs.  There is also low frequency roll off which indicates likely capacitor coupling.Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about:Crosstalk is kind of average:Power versus distortion and noise into 4 ohm load shows unacceptable rise at higher power levels:We get the rated power and no more:Into 8 ohm performance is rather strange:Weird to see that smooth and gradual rise in distortion as if not much feedback is used.Sweeps versus different frequencies indicates the same issue as distortion rises with frequency:Finally, without my AES filter, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:Pretty ugly but levels are low and of course well above our hearing.ConclusionsThe cheap looks, loud fan, and lack of power for a pro amp was enough for me to dislike the Monoprice 605030.  Then I wondered what else you could get for so little money and there is nothing that comes close.  Hell, if this doesn\\'t work as an amp, you would get your money\\'s worth in the form of chassis, power supply, etc!Personally, I am too much of an equipment elitist to want to buy this amp.  I would pay more to get a quiet unit, with more power and slightly better looks.  But you all can decide as you want. -',\n",
       " \" Starke Sound AD4.320 four channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member new and drop shipped to me.  It costs US $1,499 but they have had sales with prices as low as US $900.The Ad4.320 looks a bit industrial and is quite heavy for a class D amplifier:The reason for heavy weight is dual linear transformers and power supply on the right side.  Usually class D amplifiers use switching power supplies which keeps the unit light.  My own switching amplifier also uses a linear power supply with its weight and size penalty.I was pleased to see balanced inputs and triggers for remote on and off:As you can see, you can bridge two channels together and get double the power.  Unlike other amps that require funky connections, you have two dedicated terminals with a slide switch to select the mode  .  When I powered on the unit, I could not get output out of one channel.  I switched the bridge mode left and right   and it got both working.  For bulk of my testing I tested channels 1 and 2.Starke Sound AD4.320 MeasurementsWe start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a load of 4 ohm with power of 5 watts:Gain is atypically low at 21 dB  .  Not a problem with our dedicated DACs as they can easily provide the voltage the unit needs.  Sadly we have high 2nd and 3rd harmonics that cause SINAD to droop down to 73 dB. This is well below average of all amplifiers tested:We are talking chip-amp performance level here not anything that would come at this price range.Signal to noise ratio is better but not exciting:Multitone test shows rapid rise in distortion with frequency:The class D amplifier filter is not inside the feedback loop so shows high sensitivity to load:This means the tonality you get may depend on the actual impedance of the speaker you use.  Crosstalk between channels 1 and 2 is very good:Key performance metric for any amplifier is powered and I was very surprised to see far less power than specified:We are not even in the same planet with 104 watts vs spec  of 320!  I switched channel 2 to 3 just in case there is a power supply limit but it almost made no difference.  We are still way short of the company specs:Story repeated with 8 ohm load:Forgetting about lack of power, we also have very early rise in distortion and rising before clipping.I thought maybe they had used peak power to rate the amplifier but that is not in the same vicinity either:We do see the benefit of the linear amplifier in the way it allows higher burst power than tightly regulated switching power supplies.Sweeping the frequency and measuring power and THD+N, shows smooth lines which is good but they are quite elevated at higher frequencies:ConclusionsThe AD4.320 underperforms in so many categories.  You can argue about audibility of this and that measurements but not the lack of power. That, you will hear.  Is the unit broken?  Could be but it doesn't perform like it is broken.  I thought maybe it is set to 240 volts but it is clearly marked as being a 120 volt unit  .  And at any rate, if they shipped the amp this way to a US customer, then that is what they are going to get.I can't recommend the Starke Audio AD4.320.  Getting four channels with so much power would have been a good value if they had delivered.  But when they don't, there is no reason to buy it. \",\n",
       " \" Emotiva XPA HC-1 Monoblock amplifier.     costs US $879.As the name indicates, this is a single channel power amplifier. I have a soft spot for monoblocks and the HC-1 hits it. I especially like the power button which has buttery action and nice orange color when you hit it. Alas, then it switches to the cold, trademark blue color of Emotiva. Wish they would switch to that orange!Note that the amplifier is *very* deep, probably three times as deep as it is high.  Back panel shows nice inclusion of XLR input which is what I used for testing:The design of the amplifier is Class AB with dual power supply rails in order to keep power consumption low at lower powers. It did that as the amplifier barely generated any heat during my testing.  I was not a fan of the protection circuit though as when it clicked in  , it required power switch in the back to be toggled.  I like self-resetting protection circuits and if that is not possible, have the front panel be used for that purpose.If you are not familiar with my amplifier measurements, I highly suggest watching this video on amplifier measurements.Emotiva HC-1 Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our usual 5 watt dashboard using XLR input:My eye quickly went to the high distortion products which sadly lands the HC-1 at well below average of all amplifiers tested:Even though SINAD is distortion dominated above, noise performance at 5 watts is not anything to write home about either:I like to see an amplifier above budget prices to clear 16 bit hurdle of 96 dB at 5 watts.  Or else, sensitive speakers may spit out noise.Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and good bandwidth:Multitone test patter shines a familiar light on the amplifier when it comes to distortion:In an attempt to have more common measurements with other sites, I decided to run the 19+20 kHz intermodulation distortion  :Spray of intermodulation products around our dual tones don't paint a pretty picture.Let's run our power sweeps:We do have a lot of power but alas, that comes at the expensive of noise+distortion.  Allowing for 1% THD distortion, we do get a lot of power:Rail switching design   shows distinct change in performance as that happens:Notice how distortion is lowest around our 1 kHz testing and increased when you go lower or higher in frequency.  The latter is kind of expected but not the lower.ConclusionsThe Emotiva brand is one of budget prices but with high performance.  Alas, after testing many of their products, the right message here is budget prices with slightly below average performance.  Company really needs to retool their products and bring up the objective performance up a notch or two.  Then they will have a winning formula.  As is, we see products like HC-1 here which underperform more than half the amplifiers ever tested  .  Fortunately it is very powerful so likely sounds OK.I can't recommend the Emotiva XPS HC-1 amplifier.  It is an OK amp but we are not here for OK products. ---As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   \",\n",
       " ' Rega IO stereo integrated amplifier with phono input.      costs US $649 on Amazon including Prime shipping.  It is designed and built in UK and price there seems much more reasonable  .The front panel doesn\\'t do much for me:It is function though with a simple input switch and power.  The inclusion of remote control is a nice touch:Courtesy of the company heritage in building turntables, it has phono input built-in.  No digital inputs  which is an odd omission in this day and age.Rega IO Amplifier MeasurementsWith power amplifiers I let them run at about 5 watts into my 4 ohm load and watch their distortion+noise to see when it stabilizes.  It did not in the case of Regao IO and contrary to audiophile belief, kept getting worse!I watched every video review of this box while waiting but it would simply not stabilize.  At around 23:00 minute, I started to sense the smell of electronics running too hot so I put my hand on it.  That was a mistake as it darn near burned it!  The sides were quite hot.  I took an IR picture of it:As you see the left and right bars run much hotter with the back end being at around 45 degrees C.  This is in open air in cool weather where we live.  Imagine what it would do at higher power delivery and when put in a cabinet.  Not good.  Company provides lifetime warranty but says it won\\'t include wear and tear.  Wonder if it cooks itself whether they repair it under warranty.Anyway, let\\'s get on with our testing starting with our dashboard:A lot of things stand out.  For starters, the channel gain is not matched.  The mismatch seemed to be volume pot independent.  Then there is the matter of very high levels of mains hum and harmonics.  No matter what I did with grounding, it would not make any difference whatsoever.   The mains noise is actually higher in energy than the harmonics.  That is not a bad thing in that our sensitivity at lower frequencies is much lower than at higher ups.SINAD sums all the noise and distortion and lands the IO in the \"fair\" category:This is well below average of nearly 79 dB.Signal to noise ratio as a result is nothing to write home about:I was surprised that despite being a simple class AB design, it doesn\\'t have flat response in audible band:Most shocking measurement was that of crosstalk:Here is our multitone test showing the impact of distortion:Company specs the amp at just 30 watts into 8 ohm and good news is that it delivers that:But this is not much power.  Here is what we get into 4 ohm:Thankfully being a class AB amplifier with unregulated power supply, it does better in burst mode:Modern speakers are built in compact enclosure that reduces their efficiency greatly.  I am not sure this is enough power.Here is our frequency stepped response:Class AB designs sport clean transfer functions and the Rega is no exception.  Typical of all amps though, you lose power at very low frequencies.  Usually you have a lot to loosing some is not super painful.  Here though, you don\\'t so that is not good news.Phono Stage MeasurementsThere is no preamp output so I decided to use the headphone output to measure the RIAA equalization:Good showing here assuming you prefer less bass to LP rumble.Headphone Output MeasurementsCompany specifies the headphone output as having an impedance of > 100 ohm which is massive.  It will cause frequency response error in vast number of headphones which have variable impedance.  And on those flat ones which tend to be low, it will dissipate a lot of power internally:This is basically a checklist feature and not something that you want to use for any serious headphone listening.ConclusionsI have a soft spot for western companies trying to compete with Asian ones in budget audio products.  Alas, performance has to be there to do the job and for the most part, it is not with Rega IO.  Capability is poor as far as power output.  Measurements like crosstalk are horrid.  Headphone output is years behind times with super high impedance.  And then we have the large amount of heat this generates.  If this were a powerful amplifier I could understand idling high but not when all you have is 30 watts into 8 ohm.  Amplifiers have a tough life and you want them to be reliable.  I am not sure how long the IO will last given the elevated temps under which it operates.I don\\'t know that this is a terrible amplifier but when test after test makes me cringe, I have no choice but to withhold recommendation for Rega IO.Edit: see teardown here:  always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   ',\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A300 stereo amplifier with balanced and Bluetooth inputs.   costs US $177.I like that you can easily defeat the tone controls now and select one of three inputs, allowing the amp to replace a pre-amplifier as well.Especially nice is inclusion of power supply which is a rarity in budget/small amps:The speaker terminals are small but typical for the price class.I could see an aluminum heatsink in the box for the power device/IC.  In use though, it never warmed up above room temp.  Neither the top, or the bottom registered a temperature rise which is nice.AIYIMA A300 MeasurementsLet's start with unbalanced RCA input first, setting the gain to 29 dB as with other amps I test with adjustable gain:Switching to balanced we essentially get the same performance:That distortion spike at nearly -72 dB limits SINAD to below average:In fairness and comparison to a few amplifiers with much lower gain, I also tested the amp at 12 dB gain:A bit better but still not enough to cross the average line.  For the rest of the tests, I stuck with XLR input and 29 dB gain.Here is our SNR:These are disappointing numbers relative to what AIYIMA has shown it can do.Multitone test result is not too bad:Crosstalk is good:Frequency response unfortunately shows load dependency:Key here is to see if we can get more power out of this small package and we do:Interestingly, we get almost as much with 8 ohm load!Back to 4 ohm load, with short bursts we get a lot more power:Finally, there is little frequency/power dependency which is very good for a class D amplifier:Warm Up Time MeasurementAmplifier stabilizes quickly:ConclusionsIt would have been great if the A300 had followed the footsteps of previous AIYIMA amps but with more power.  Alas, it delivers on more power at the expense of noise and distortion.  Assuming you don't hear the noise, it may be the right trade off in a budget amplifier.  On packaging, I really like the integrated box with XLR inputs.  Amplifier power supplies can be huge and that is avoided here. I am personally snobbish and want my power with low noise and distortion so can't recommend the AIYIMA A300.  But your priorities may be different. \",\n",
       " ' Crown XLS2502 DriveCore   2-channel amplifier. The XLS 2502 cost US $645 including free shipping from Amazon.  It has DSP functionality which I did not test.  And is specified to drive 2 ohm load.From the outside, the XLS2502 is built like a tank:It is very light of course due to switching topology for the amplifier and power supply.  But also very sturdy with plenty of steel to keep its shape.The two gain controls are notched which gives them a nice feeling but the gain is not matched and is hard to get there using those notches.Here is the back connectivity:There is a fan as you see but in normal testing it never came up. During stress testing, it did come on but was pretty quiet compared to what I expected.  Mind you, I don\\'t think you want it close to you if it is going to be running.Alas, the fan was insufficient to keep the unit cool under full power.  The red thermal indicators came up even though the fan was running.  The amp seemed to be functioning still but to be on the safe side, I terminated my testing there.  In typical home use, even for subwoofer duty, I doubt that this is a concern as you will see later as far as what wattage we are talking about.Overall, the impression of the amplifier is positive, making you think you have something made to be run over by a car and still function reliably.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:I set the gain to 29 dB for consistency.  I also tested it at 19 dB gain and it only made 1 to 2 dB improvement.  The reason is that SINAD   is dominated by harmonic distortion.  Here, those harmonics are very high order which perceptually is not very good as they are not masked as easily.  Anyway, with a SINAD of 71 dB, we have below average performance:The XLS1502 did a bit better in this regard, garnering a SINAD of 77 dB.Frequency response shows the same sharp cut off:I don\\'t know if this can be changed using DSP programming or not.Above is with resistive load.  Switching to a simulation of a 2-way speaker gets us little difference:So there is some speaker dependency but I would not lose sleep over it.Crosstalk is OK but could be better:The red line is a $30 amplifier by the way.32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" gives a more hopeful picture of distortion:The spray of harmonics is high in frequency where our hearing threshold is higher.Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts but gets better at full power:Lower gain settings may improve this a few dBs.Amplifier Power MeasurementsYou don\\'t buy this amplifier to listen at 5 watts so let\\'s see what it can do when its wings are given enough room to fly:Wow!  Nearly 500 watts of power is delivered into both channels simultaneously.  The good news doesn\\'t end there. Check out these ratings when distortion is relaxed to 1%:1600 watts of peak power is delivered out of standard 120 volt outlet!  These thing is a powerful beast.Noise level is decent but I wanted to make sure the high gain was not impacting it.  So I reduced gain to 19 dB which required some 6 volts of input to drive to clipping:There is no difference at all.For the rest of these tests I stayed at 19 dB gain.  Here is the power output with 8 ohm:Over 300 watts at what should be inaudible distortion for most people.Finally we get to my stress test.  I played with the settings because the high frequency noise shaping would not let me perform the sweep.  So I decided to change this test and set the limit to 22.4 kHz   and limit the sweep to 6 kHz.  That way, the third harmonic of 6 kHz   is still included in the computation.  No music has full power at high frequencies anyway so I don\\'t think we need to keep measuring to 20 kHz with respect to power.  Here is the output:As noted, the red warning lights came on as the sweep was going from right to left so I terminated the test.  Delivered output was about 520 watts which is still plenty but is naturally lower than 1 kHz which was in high 600s.ConclusionsThese pro amps have mastered the technique of delivering tons of power with distortion and noise kept under control.  Lack of power is the #1 reason an amplifier can sound bad.  Don\\'t care how good the SINAD is at 5 watt.  If you run out of power, you will hear distortion, lack of dynamics, etc.  So if you need the power, it is best to get it than to have less of it.  And on that front, the Crown XLS 2502 delivers tons of it, breaking all previous records for any amplifier I have tested.  The price is ridiculously low for the amount of power you get as well.Ideally, you would use more finessed amplifiers above bass frequencies and use the XLS 2502 to drive the subs.  But if not, the XLS2502 can deliver good performance.Overall, I am going to recommend the XLS 2502. -',\n",

Ethernet input allows a nicely done web interface to be used from anywhere:There is a microphone I believe and ability to automatically calibrate the room response.  I did not use or dive into this functionality.There is a fan that came on when powered on but nicely powered down gradually and I did not hear it during operation.  When it runs it has a lower frequency and a bit less annoying than on pro amplifiers.There is a strange setting for 2 vs 4 ohm speaker load.  I set it to 4 since I tested it at 4 and 8 ohms.  Manual doesn't say exactly what this does.APA1200DSP Amplifier MeasurementsI set the gain to -10 dB which gave me the nominal 29 dB I look for and measured using XLR input:Switching to digital input showed essentially the same performance:This level of noise+distortion   puts this amp way down in our rankings:Noise level was not very good either, using analog or digital input:Unit was stable on power up which is good:Crosstalk was decent:Multitone suffered from high noise floor and sporadic distortion spikes:Sadly frequency response is highly load dependent due to class D amp's output filter interacting:We also see sharp cut off due to internal processing being at low sampling rate.  Switching to digital input at 96 kHz sampling made no difference:The name indicates it produces 1200 watts.  Let's see what it can do into 4 om with both channels driven:The curve wiggles as protection circuit kicks in.  Prior to that, it produced 370 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% didn't do much better:Switching to 8 ohm naturally cut the power substantially:Stepping through the test frequency shows a number of odd behaviors:ConclusionsTypical of this class of amplifier, power specs are mostly imaginary.  Objective measurement of noise and distortion are also typical with little attention paid to minimize them.  So you are left with buying this for functionality not because it has any great implementation of class D amplification.I can't recommend the Dayton Audio APA1200DSP DSP based on its pure measured performance.

Doesn't matter if the performance is good anyway.Is this the first audio product we have tested from Serbia?Vista Audio Spark MeasurementsI had to crank the volume all the way up to get close to my nominal 29 dB gain  :Boy, that is a lot of power supply noise.  Playing with grounding reduced the spikes at 60 Hz a bit but did nothing to the harmonics which are caused by the internal power supply.  Even if that was low, the distortion spikes are not.  As a result, the amplifier rates quite low in our overall ranking:Signal to noise ratio is better than what we saw in the dashboard indicating the noise floor rises with power:I was surprised to see a bass roll off in this day and age where just about every amplifier is dc-coupled:Multitone shows a messy response with the lows polluted by the power supply and highs due to inadequate feedback:Crosstalk is below average:The amplifier is rated at only 20 watts but I was not able to get that:It did better actually with 8 ohm load indicating current delivery is its issue:Back to 4 ohm, if you allow more distortion or buRst the input, you do get a bit more power:Finally, there is fair bit of variability when we sweep frequencies:ConclusionsSometimes I really wonder what appeal such amplifiers have that attract buyers.  This amp has too little power to drive most speakers and has a lot of noise and distortion as well.  There must be some mystique about it that I don't understand.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Vista Audio Spark II amplifier.  I hope the designer sees these measurements and at least works to sharply reduce the power supply noise as that can't be anything good no matter what school you are from. -\",\n",

The latest version is being sold on Amazon for US $277 including Prime shipping.  Considering this is a brand name company and we have a class AB amplifier, this seems like a reasonable price.The Zamp V.3 comes in a tiny and rather cute, half-rack package:In addition to power button, you also have a headphone jack.  From the bit I have read, the output is just the amplifier with a resistor inline.  This means its output impedance is high   and likely noisy as well.  I did not test it.The back panel exposes good bit of control not seen on \"normal\" hifi amplifiers:Parasound has a leg in two industries: the Custom Integration   channel and hifi.  The former is for companies who install these amplifiers in hide-away places to for example power a couple of speakers for a bedroom TV.  The gain controls and such give flexibility to this kind of installation as does the small form factor  :Crosstalk was poor, matching a $25 amplifier I tested:Frequency response is OK:Noise performance as you can predict from the dashboard is not fantastic:Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet\\'s get into the most important bit which is power capability starting with 4 and going into 8 ohms:Weird how one channel goes crazy at just 1 to 2 watt.  Specs are matched though.Allowing for higher distortion of 1% doesn\\'t help with max power but does give us more burst power:Thermal StabilityHere is the test that resulted in the shutdown:I was messing with grounding and caused that little blip so ignore that.ConclusionsI really like the cute and small form factor of this amp for desktop use.  Alas, with a weak thermal management, it won\\'t produce much volume before shutting down.  Used ones have probably had a hard life due to this reason as well.  If you are going to play with one and want to shy away from the million switching amplifiers out there in this price range, go ahead.  But I can\\'t recommend the unit. -',\n",
       " \" Yamaha A-U671 USB DAC and integrated class D amplifier. The A-U671 costs US 499 but most vendors say it is no longer available even though it shows as current on Yamaha site.  How fast modern gear becomes obsolete...Yamaha has been clever to mimic the look of 1970s and 1980s switchgear:Alas, the controls are plastic and don't have nearly the nice feel of their old brethren.  The volume control is motorized though and is operable through the remote. A built-in DAC and analog input would nicely satisfy many people.  Unfortunately the unit arrived with something rattling in it. I took it part to find out it was a clamp of sort for the power supply bundle that had come loose.  I put it back together and all worked except the USB DAC.  I could control it, change its sample rate and such but it would not produce audio  .  Another one of the power supply screws was also loose.  They should have put thread lock on them so that they don't come loose. The back panel is as expected but with decent quality speaker terminals:Since I had to take the unit apart anyway, here is a quick teardown:The DAC is on top and the amp on the bottom of the green board.  The yellow board is the switching power supply.  And that black wrapper is what had come lose.In use the amp was very quick to shut down on overload.  It would actually power off telling me it may be the power supply that is undersized. Temperature rise is not remotely an issue. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load @ 5 watts:I set the volume control manually to 29 dB as I normally do with integrated amps.  SINAD which represents the worst of noise and/or distortion is dominated by distortion.  At 70 dB, this is well below average:Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about either:Crosstalk is good  :Frequency response is problematic, showing that it changes with your speaker load:Multitone shows frequency dependent error and high noise floor:Here are the power ratings:The regulated switching power supply allows no headroom:Thermal StabilityNot a whole lot changed with warm-up:ConclusionsI have a soft spot for the look of the Yamaha A-U671.  And inclusion of a USB DAC in a light and compact enclosure.  Not much else to hang your hat on from there on.  If you can find one at a yard sale for $100 it would be a good purchase.  I don't know that I would buy it over so many other modern choices with Room EQ and streaming built-in. -\",\n",
       " ' Naim Uniti Atom streamer, DAC and integrated amplifier.     costs US $3,799.The overall industry design is attractive and has a high-end look to it.  Alas, every part of the unit has an ultra sharp edge from heatsinks to edges of the plexiglass   front panel.  It is a heavy box which makes you really feel those sharp edges as if they are going to tear into your skin.  It was unpleasant every time I had to move or rotate the unit.The front panel is large and sharp which I like.  Alas, and strangely so, it is not a touch screen.  In this day and age and at this price, a touchscreen is a requirement in my opinion.  A very large rotary control managed the volume.  It seem to have some kind of acceleration but wasn\\'t very intuitive.Here is the back panel:I was surprised to see the compact binding posts that are made only for banana plugs.  Likewise there is no USB B to use the unit as a DAC.  Maybe you can use the type-A connector for that but even so, it is very unusual choice.  Nice to see a floating ground switch.  In my testing, it only impacted the networked tests.  Otherwise it had no effect.Inclusion of HDMI is very important to allow sound from TV to be piped into it.Upon booting and with Ethernet cable plugged in, it nicely told me there is new firmware.  It took something like 10 minutes to download the image and then went into a seemingly infinity cycles of booting, dark screen, non-descript progress bar and power button that would fade on or off or solid on.  I left there for probably half hour when it finally seem to be ready.There is the usual app to control it but I opted for the included remote control.  It too has very sharp edges but otherwise functional.Naim Uniti Atom DAC MeasurementsI started by testing the unit using Coax due to lack of type-B or type-c USB port.  Here is our usual dashboard:Distortion dominates causing our SINAD   to barely reach into \"fair\" category:Distortion rises into the noise floor of even 16 bit content so not a good first showing.  As noted, changing the grounding mode made no difference in any of these measurements.The output stage is capable of higher voltage which is nice:Good to see the output does not become all distorted once the internal amplifier is pushed beyond clipping. Noise performance is not competitive with even budget DACs but almost good enough for 16-bit playback:Multitone distortion was quite high:Jitter display looks clean but noise floor is high and is masking interference patterns:Levels of those spurious tones though is quite low and inaudible  .We have a rather odd filter response:This partially contributes to rather poor noise+distortion relative to frequency:Finally, linearity matches the fair performance of the rest of the system:Naim Uniti Atom Amplifier MeasurementGiven the choice of analog or digital input, I tested both which producing 5 watts:Performance is very close so I opted to use analog in as that makes the comparison to other amps easier.  Notice the high power supply noise at 120 Hz  .  Overall ranking is well below average:Frequency response test with analog input shows a brick wall filter which indicates input is being digitized:Shame then that no DSP functionality is provided.  The roll off filter in the ADC causes some drooping in the high frequencies.Crosstalk response was kind of shaky but overall good:Multitone test once again shows less than optimal performance:Rated power is low and that is what we see:Sweeping the frequency for power measurement we get orderly response:Notice the typical sharp drop in power at 20 Hz.  This is why you need more powerful amplifier than you think you are getting.  Power is needed in bass but the reservoir capacitors in the power supply get depleted and you don\\'t get as much output.Naim Unit Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI expected the headphone output to be \"junk\" but it actually is not:That is plenty of output for satisfactory response of high impedance headphones.  Noise floor is not competitive with any modern/recommended headphone amp but could have been far worse.  At 32 ohm though, available power is much more limited:Sweeping the load we see that the headphone amplifier is not capable of much current delivery:So best to stay with high impedance headphones.Naim Uniti Atom Streaming MeasurementsI ran the streaming tests a day later and here, I noticed noise bleeding into the output:So I tried the ground lift switch and it remedied that:SINAD though is dominated by high distortion so didn\\'t matter one way or the other.  And performance is the same as local/coax S/PDIF input.ConclusionsPerformance of Naim Atom ranges from fair/adequate to rather poor.  Shame that when you pay so much for a piece of audio, not much design hygiene is included.  I suspect more went into software development and enclosure design than making sure the hardware is performant.  I hope for a version 2 the company works to substantially improve the performance of these subsystems.  I am sure many buy a Naim product thinking they are getting great audio performance.I can\\'t recommend the Naim Uniti Atom streaming amplifier.P.S.  I was going to give the mailman panther rating to the unit but he is out making deliveries...... ',\n",
       " ' vintage Audio Research D300 Power Amplifier.    a local member.  The D300 came out circa 1995 and initially cost US $3,500 but then price rose to US $4,000.  Quick search shows used ones going for US $1,500.The D300 is built like a tank:I am confident you could drive over it and nothing will happen to it.  Even the handles are massive which is a blessing as an ultra heavy transformer sits vertically behind the front panel. I could carry the D300 by myself so it is not too heavy to be unmanageable. The back panel is as you expect:With one exception: the non-detachable power cord.   What is there though seems amply sufficient as it is supple yet quite thick.Heatsinks are very thick gauge and in use, they got warm but not hot.  The rest of the case got warm as well.  The amp never complained no matter what I did to it in testing.Overall, if you want an understated but high quality feel, that is what you have in D300.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Ouch.  Lots of second harmonic causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion and noise to be rather poor.  As such the D300 lands well below average in our list of some 62 amplifiers tested to date:Noise performance was quite good though so it is the distortion that is the problem:32-tone test signal representing \"music\" showed what we already know as far as rather high distortion levels:Frequency response was excellent:As was crosstalk  :Let\\'s get into the meat of the measurements with power vs THD+N starting at 4 ohm:Boy, this is worse than the dashboard indicated.  Almost immediately, distortion takes over and keeps climbing.  While the D300 is much more quiet, it quickly loses to an integrated home theater receiver  !  Not good.Same story repeats for 8 ohm load:Distortion is so high at higher power levels that if we set a limit of 0.1% for THD+N, we only get 60 watts out of each channel!Relaxing that to 0.2% though gave us a lot more power and no indication of frequency mattering.  This was proven yet again in our multiple sweeps:All the lines fall on top of each other indicating the amp just doesn\\'t care what frequency you feed it.  It amplifies it, adds a heap of distortion and that is that. Makes you want to cry and celebrate at the same time!ConclusionsThere is clear excellence in the engineering in Audio Research D300.  Build quality is superb as well.  There must have been a conscious decision to use low amount of feedback which translated into rising distortion with power.  It is a shame that capable designers follow audiophile myths to build non-performant amplifiers when they could do so much better.In this day and age, this type of performance is not competitive so I really can\\'t recommend the D300.  Then again if you want something with high build quality and can get the unit on the cheap, it makes for a decent option. -As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.Ever walk through a high-end department store and get hounded by the ladies selling perfume?  I know to ignore them but the pink panther I was taking for a walk there fell for it and made me buy him a fancy bottle for $100.  Needless to say, I feel poor so could use some extra money.

       " \" Topping PA3 desktop amplifier.  I have had a ton of requests to measure this amplifier so I asked the company to send me one.  They said they would do so but cautioned me that it would not measure well.  The PA3 costs US $120 on Amazon including free shipping.I must stay, compared to all the budget amplifiers I have tested, the PA3 looks like luxury goods!  It comes in a hefty case and oozes quality:There are dual inputs as you see which you can control using the power button.  A massive, Topping branded external power supply is provided which even goes as far as having textured design on the back side:Most importantly, all the regulatory certifications are there which we know from past examination to be true and certified by third-party labs.  This is one budget amplifier I wouldn't hesitate to leave on unattended.Implementation is based on TDA7498E ST Micro chip amp.  Topping PA3 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm using 1 kHz tone:As you see I adjusted the volume control to give us the nominal 29 dB gain I usually test at.  SINAD is dominated by distortion which at 0.036% which correlates well with ST Micro's 0.05% spec at 1 watt.  Alas, this is well below average for all amplifiers we have tested and some of the latest chip amp products:SNR slots in the same bucket of performance:Crosstalk is pretty good showing good attention to isolation:Frequency response unfortunately is very load dependent:We get about 51 watts into 4 ohm with both channels driven with distortion dominating  :Power naturally drops with 8 ohm load but not as much some others I have seen:Peak power matches company spec which is a novelty in this space:Note that there was a really strong protection circuit that would not allow me to push the amp more than I did for max power so I had to settle for lower distortion of 0.5%.  It would shut down if I told it to work harder to hit 1%.Distortion takes off rather quickly with frequency as we see in multitone test:Same is see in our frequency versus power and distortion+noise:Fortunately our hearing threshold starts to go up at higher frequencies so audibility is less impacted than our sensibility about good engineering.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping did what it could to build a reliable, safe and robust desktop platform for this amplifier.  Alas, they are held down significantly by the performance of the underlying chip amp which is likely all that was available at the time this product was designed.  Being selfish elitist audiophile engineering types that we are, we have no choice but to pass on this amplifier.  If you are not picky however and want something that is build safe and well, you could choose otherwise.So to repeat, I can't recommend the Topping PA3 based on its audio performance.  Hopefully there are future products based on a better platform. -\",\n",
       " ' Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 integrated amplifier with tube buffer.      costs US $1,599.The front panel of the Sphinx portrays a high-end look with its thick metal:Alas, that thin metal surrounding it, takes that impression away.  I liked the very wide apart inputs and output terminals which \"should\" bode well for crosstalk measurements:There is good bit of weight to the unit courtesy of power transformer.  I like the inclusion of the balance control.  As you see in the first picture, I had to use it to get same gain out of both channels.  Protection circuit was well done with automatic recovery and worked great no matter how hard I pushed it.Internal amplification is provided by a pair of Hypex UCD 180 OEM class D amplifiers.  A buffer state made out of tubes completes the picture.The amplifier has won many accolades as indicated by their mention on the product page:Let\\'s see if objectively they are right.Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 MeasurementsAs usual, I set the gain to 29 dB and feed the amp a 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm at 5 watts and see what we get:What we get is not very nice.  Broad set of harmonics to the tune of -80 dB do away with any notion of \"tube sound.\"  Add fair bit of noise and SINAD which is a measure of distortion+noise sinks quite low:That\\'s 10 dB worse than the media across 140 amplifiers tested so far.  Not good.  As a reference, Hypex specifications shows a SINAD of 84 dB so 15 dB was lost in the addition of the buffer stage in this amplifier.Another thing that is not good is signal to noise ratio:So even at full power your 2 bits short of CD\\'s dynamic range. The shocker was the normally \"innocent\" crosstalk test which just about every amplifier does well in:Then comes Sphinx, losing to our $20 throw-away amplifier!  Clearly zero attention was paid to isolation of the two channels.Frequency response also shows sloppy attention to producing the audible band properly:Let\\'s measure our power vs distortion:Definitely much less happy driving 4 ohm load.  Here is our peak and max power:So moderately powerful although without much headroom.ConclusionsRogue Audio takes a perfectly serviceable Hypex UcD 180 amplifiers and adds copious amount of noise and distortion with its front-end.  Mind you, despite use of the tube, it doesn\\'t give that 2nd harmonic dominant result.  It just raises the noise and distortion, robbing you of transparency.  But hey, folks buy audio products by how many myths are included in their design and Rogue audio gets there with that tube stage.  Perfect marketing, poor engineering.  Story of high-end audio.Needless to say, I can NOT recommend the Rogue Audio Sphinx V3.  You can get plenty of better amplifiers for this level of money. -',\n",
       " ' Behringer NX3000D Pro DSP power amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me by a member.  It costs US $399.As pro amplifiers go, the NX3000D is half attractive especially when on with its amber lights and LEDs:There are variable   gains as you see.  I did not play with the DSP or menu system but it lets you do such useful things as setting up a crossover to drive a sub.  There is built-in power limiting in there.The unit is quite light.  So light that you think it may fly away given its large and noisy fan:The fan unfortunately is not temperature sensitive and wails away upon power up!  I am sure saving weight is a big deal when you try to squeeze every dollar out of shipping costs.  Good news is that as they advertise, this thing runs as cool as it can get.  After a bunch of testing, the temperature was the same as the room.Note that speaker connections are SpeakOn which I like but not common in consumer audio.  Inputs are only balanced XLR/1/4 combo.  There is extra gain though to use RCA unbalanced with them using an adapter.  Where I placed the gain knobs provided 29 dB of gain.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amp 1 kHz and see what else it outputs beside that at 5 watts into 4 ohm test load:What it outputs is a bunch of distortion in the form of third harmonic at 3 kHz placing the unit well below average:Note also the disparity in channel output which you can also see in the frequency response measurement:The gain controls are notched so not easy to select any in-between gains to adjust for this.Another news is how narrow the bandwidth is.  Being a DSP amplifier, it digitizes the input and it seems to use 48 kHz sampling resulting in bandwidth of 24 kHz.Noise performance is not that great at 5 watts, falling well below 96 dB we like to see for CD/streaming 16-bit content:Fortunately at full power  , you do clear that hurdle.These amps are sold almost exclusively by how much power they produce versus their cost so let\\'s get into that with 4 ohm load:Seems like the rated power numbers are a fantasy unless they are measured for one channel driven, not two as I do.  Still, 400 watts is lots of power in such a cheap package.  You get a  bit more as well if you allow the distortion to rise to 1% and also measure it as a peak  :Switching the load to 8 ohms naturally lowers available power:Switching/class-D amps can have complex distortion profiles that highly depend on frequency and power level and we see some of that here:At higher frequencies different distortion mechanisms become dominant causing the curves to go up and down. While I always see some power loss at 20 Hz, it is disappointing to see it dip so low to just 268 watts for an amplifier rated at \"900 watts.\"  Bass is where we need the power.Finally, we can remove our filter and examine the ultrasonic spectrum to see what the amp is producing there:Switching frequency seems to be around 410 kHz which is well above the audible band, and is attenuated quite a lot for a switching amplifier  .  I am not too happy to see so much other junk there though although not audible per se.ConclusionsPro amps can often make good alternative to hi-fi amps since they are sold at much lower cost/watt than consumer products.  We get that in Behringer NX3000D but we also get the other drawbacks of pro products in the form of high fan noise.  And distortion that is pretty high.  If you can hide it some place and use it to do drive a subwoofer it should be fine.  But otherwise, I think a more quiet amplifier would work better for home hifif than this unit.Overall, the Behringer NX3000D is not my cup of tea for home use so I can\\'t recommend it. -',\n",
       " ' Luxman SQ-N150 hybrid integrated amplifier with phono stage.     costs US $3,295.Can you say pretty? I knew you could!  Love the elegant front panel with VU meter. Nice set of balance and tone controls are provided as well:As you can see, power amplification is provided through ECC83 triode drivers going to EL84 power tubes. Amplifier is conservatively designed and is rate at just 10+10 watts into 6 ohms. I like the look without the cage but here it is with:Not much exciting in the back other than modern, beefy speaker terminals than that of vintage tube amplifiers:The package is smaller than one imagines but weighs a hefty 27 pounds.  Notice the AC terminal doesn\\'t have earth ground and unit is double insulated. In testing I found no effect from earthing the unit or not.Front-end and pre-amps are solid state:Luxman SQ-N150 Amplifier MeasurementsWhen I picked 5 watts as my standard for measuring amplifiers, it was usually a fraction of the amplifier power but here it is nearly half the available power!  So relatively speaker, distortion plays a much strong role than it would otherwise:The high second and third harmonics set the stage as far as SINAD   but I wish there was not so much power supply noise.  Sadly the amplifier takes up the ranking of second worst amplifier I have ever measured as far as distortion+noise:Those power supply spikes set the lower bound for dynamic range:It is not too bad but you likely will use very sensitive speakers with this low power amplifier so the numbers may manifest themselves more than they usually do.Frequency response is extended but shows a kink indicating some kind of filter:Crosstalk does not follow the usual curve indicating some sort of resistive   element between the two channels:Normally the issue is capacitive which causes the two reference lines you see.Multitone which is supposed to resemble \"music\" with its 32 tone, shows strong level of \"grass\"  :Hard to make a case that you are hearing more detail when so much is masked at this power level.I don\\'t have a 6 ohm load so used my usual 4 and 8 ohm loads for power testing:Edit: forgot to post the different frequency sweeps:Luxman SQ-N150 Phono Stage MeasurementsThe amplifier noise and distortion dwarfs the phono stage so I only checked its frequency response:So very good on this critical measurement.Luxman SQ-N150 Headphone MeasurementsFor same reason as above, I just made a power measurement:Seems usable from power availability point of view but noise and distortion are quite high.  Company specifies 16 ohm output impedance and wisely recommends against using low impedance headphones for good reason:The headphone amplifier is simply connected to the amplifier output using the aforementioned resistor which eats up all the power.  It will also change the frequency response of your headphone if it is not flat.  So best to be avoided.Luxman SQ-N150 Listening TestsMy lab speaker is an infinity R253 which has a sensitivity of 87 dB.  I connected it to the SQ-N150 and started to listen.  I had to immediately acknowledge the lack of power as the volume control not only maxed out but there was so much distortion as to cause crackling noise.  I backed off to moderate listening level and the sound was OK but I noticed boominess in the lows as if you have more room modes than you do.  To confirm, I switched to Topping PA5 amplifier on my bench and boominess was gone.  Likely the harmonic distortion of the amplifier is hitting on more room modes causing extra bass/boominess.  I can see if your speakers/setup lacks bass that you experience a bit more of it.The volume control had to be kept below 12:00 o\\'clock.  By 1:00 o\\'clock distortion would start to set in and sound would start to get grungy and rough.  Past 2:00 o\\'clock it would be rather obvious and beyond that, unusable.  There was usable volume with me sitting 5 feet from the single speaker.  With two speakers you could double that but it is still not enough power for me with this speaker.  If an audio reviewer can\\'t hear this level of distortion, they should give up testing audio gear.  Sadly none of the reviews I read made a remark about the distortion.  It is the classic case of paying a lot more and getting a lot less fidelity and enjoyment.ConclusionsThe high level picture here is very clear: wonderful looking, and presumably well built amplifier.  The problem is using tube technology and producing so little power. I see no advantage to it, euphonically or otherwise.  But it is possible for some people the bass impact is a positive.  But at what cost?  So much spent with so little dynamic capability due to lack of power.Needless to say I can\\'t recommend the Luxman SQ-N150.  -',\n",
       " '  of Optoma/NuForce STA-200 Power Amplifier. I see it listed for USD $499 including Prime shipping.  Looking elsewhere, it appears to have a list price of $1299.This is one attractive enclosure that does not usually come in a $500 package:The finish is slightly textured and looks pretty nice.Feature wise, there is nothing there but a set of RCA inputs and speakers.  The RCA inputs are paired with speaker terminals on each end of the unit so you better have RCA cables that separate that much.Somewhat out of character is a traditional extruded aluminum heatsink poking out the back.   I guess this avoids having to put the heatsink inside and having to vent the enclosure.  The heatsink is pretty small though and it was cooking even when testing the unit at just 5 watts/channel.  I worry about its ability to run OK at full power for any extended amount of time.Rated power is 80 watts/channel with 8 ohm load.  My testing was at 4 ohm however.Let\\'s get into measurements and see how she does.MeasurementsAs with my previous amplifier tests, let\\'s start with a dashboard view of the unit while it was outputting 5 watts:Boy, this is disappointing.  We have tons of mains and power supply components  .  The dominant distortion components are the cause of poor SINAD though with the second harmonic peaking up to nearly -70 dB.  So even if the rest were not there, the SINAD would remain the same.Company states THD+N of < 0.03% and we are essentially there so our testing is correct.  The write-up brags about response up to 1 Mhz and such.  I suspect instead of using fair amount of feedback to bring the distortion down, they have traded for wider bandwidth. Looking at the power rating versus distortion, the STA-200 doesn\\'t bring much to the party over the much cheaper Topping TP60  :Yes, there is less noise at lower power levels but by the time we get to 1 watt, they equalize in performance and at limit, the Topping TP60   actually has less distortion.The spec says the signal to noise ratio is 100 dB.  My measurements fall somewhat short of that:Likely the mains intrusion is the cause  .Sweeping input level and measuring IMD we get:As with THD, the STA200 has good bit less noise than Topping TP-60 but then suddenly clips and clips badly.  Looking at the gain we see why:This is a lot of gain for a low power amplifier.  No wonder sensitivity is spec\\'ed at just 0.45 volt  .  This means if you may have to significantly turn down the volume in your pre-amp/dac+pre.  This would make for an amp that plays loud due to its high gain and perhaps that is a conscious choice.Frequency response is reasonable to 40 kHz  :Anyway, I think we have enough here to know the merits of this amplifier.ConclusionsI was pretty depressed when I reviewed the Topping TP60 and FX Audio FX502SPro and had high hopes that the NuForce STA200 would easily outperform them.  Such was not the case.  The Topping TP60 at less than half the price essentially matches its performance.  It also runs substantially cooler than this unit.  It doesn\\'t look quite as nice though although it has a more manageable desktop form factor if that is how you use it.The NuForce ST-200 seems to cater the audiophile myth of \"fast\" and high-bandwidth amplifiers, sacrificing fidelity to get there.  This is a poor trade off in my book when just about all the content we play is quite band limited.',\n",
       " ' Sabaj A1 desktop   amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  Not sure if it is still in production but you can still find it for $60 or so.  Main interest in testing this unit is the use of the TPA3118 class D amplifier which is used in all kinds of other devices including Genelec 8030c powered monitor!For the price the enclosure is not half bad:A little LED display shows the active input   and current volume level.  As is typical, a laptop sized power supply provides the juice:The unit runs cool.  If you overtax it, it will reset and power back on at low output level.Sabaj A1 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt dashboard:As you see I set the gain to 29 dB which is the \"standard\" I use for integrated amplifiers.  Resulting SINAD is dominated by distortion and is well below average for all amps tested:But... if you compare it to other low cost amps in this price bracket, performance is a good 10 dB better.Noise performance is in the same class:Frequency response is not flat but good to see it rolling off as opposed to peaking:Crosstalk is what you expect in this type of device:Most important is power and this is how the A1 did into 4 ohm:Not a whole lot of power I am afraid.  Pushing it harder didn\\'t do any good either:The power supply runs out of juice and the device shuts down.  May do better with a more powerful power supply.  Here it is into 8 ohm:ConclusionsAs a class I expect these cheap amps to be broken.  The A1 is not that bad.  My concern is too little power.  Many small speakers are inefficient and you need more than 20 watts to get decent performance out of them.  My suggestion is to save on spending money on food and flowers and save up for a better amp.  But if you can\\'t, the Sabaj A1 may do the job for you.As it is, I can\\'t recommend the Sabaj A1.  I am too much of an audio/technology snob to go for it! -',\n",

Member purchased it for just $158 on sale!You probably can\\'t tell from the picture but this is a massive box.  It weighs over 50 pounds/23 kilograms and is quite deep.  Rack mounts are provided and needed for both front and back. A review says the back holes don\\'t align right however.  Back panel shows why this amplifier is also tailored for multi-room distribution:\\\\By selecting \"bus mode,\" a single input is distributed to any number of channels from 1 to 8.  In mono or stereo.  Trim pots are provided to adjust the gain for each channel although there were kind of too sensitive to set accurately.The side panels gave me paus until I powered the unit:I feared that those fans would make huge amount of noise but to my pleasant surprise, they barely move and are essentially silent.  They never sped up or got louder during testing.  This is far better solution than my pro amps I test with loud and small fans that are not even temperature sensitive.Back to the front, the power switch is quite bright   and bleeds into the LED bar graphs.  But once the unit is on, the LED bar graphs themselves light up and more or less cover that issue.  The power switch feels quite solid.Pyle as a brand is know for cheap   so my expectations were not high going into the review.  The overall construction though, with dual toroidal transformers in front, portrayed a different picture.  Let\\'s see how it measures.Pyle PT8000CH MeasurementsI stayed with stereo measurements for this section selecting the channels 7 and 8 that are next to the AC power input.  Warm up allowed the amp to improve a bit:Here is our dashboard:We have a spray of harmonic distortion that sinks SINAD fairly low:Zooming in:We see that the company that it keeps is not too bad!  SNR falls inline or perhaps a bit better:Multitone is as we would expect from the dashboard:Frequency response is good although I wished for a bit more bandwidth as to get a flatter response to 20 kHz:Crosstalk though was surprisingly poor:Let\\'s see how much power we have into 2 channels:Benefit of large power supply comes in when just driving in stereo:Here is 8 ohm performance  :Finally, here is power vs frequency:Here is on/off noise:I hooked up the amplifier to an infinity R253 speaker and I could hear a faint pop on power up.  Power off seemed silent although the fan noise may have masked that.Multichannel Amplifier TestingMy analyzer is only stereo but I drove all channels with the same 8 ohm load.  Here is the output power in stereo and 8 channels:We are meeting spec here which is good  .All the testing so far has been resistive.  Let\\'s make the load \"reactive\" by 30 and 60 degrees angle and also sweep down to 2 ohm and see what happens:This is quite robust!  At both 4 and 8 ohms, the amp doesn\\'t care if the load is reactive or not.  At 2 ohm though, it starts to complain, dropping its output voltage by nearly half.  Testing at 1 ohm resulted in momentary shutdown.ConclusionsThe build quality of this 8-channel amplifier seems quite substantial.  Massive power supply courtesy of dual toroidal transformers powers the 8 channels well, allowing the amplifier to meet spec.  Distortion and noise are rather high though and rank well below our average.  The amplifier protection and ability to handle complex loads is excellent. You are paying almost nothing for this amplifier   yet you get way above a broken design.  The PT8000CH won\\'t be my main choice for a high-performance 2-channel system but for surround duty and certainly multi-room amplification, it seems fine.I am going to recommend the Pyle PT8000CH.  Not because it has great measured performance as far as noise and distortion.  But that it delivers way, way above its cost point.Edit: teardown is now posted:  always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   ',\n",
       " \" Topping MX3 DAC, Bluetooth, Headphone Amplifier, and Power amplifier.  You even get a remote control with it. Despite all that functionality it costs just USD $130 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  I bought mine from Massdrop 10 months ago.  I don't know what I paid but likely less.From the outside, the MX3 looks quite attractive:It has the same design language as the Topping DX3 Pro but even more attractive with that slanted logo.  The volume control is digital and very sensitive.  There is a ton of functionality here which I won't go into as there is a good review of it from Z which I will post after this review.  Suffice it to say, it is very feature rich and well designed for such a bargain product.Everything is powered by an external laptop sized switching power supply:Not only is extra expense incurred in getting a Topping branded power supply, but typical of them it comes with full compliance with regulatory bodies both in US and EU.For most of my testing, I used the USB input but did give the Aux analog input a try as well.  I did not test the subwoofer out.  Not did I play with Bluetooth.If the MX3 performs, it will be the audio miracle of modern times so let's get into measurements.  But first a note: I had to take some shortcuts to get through all of this functionality.  I think it represents the missing measurements.DAC MeasurementsThere are no line outs on the MX3 so I used the headphone output set to 2 volts to get our dashboard view:Oh no! Distortion is fairly high putting the MX3 in bottom class of all DACs tested:This is quite a bit worse than any DAC Topping has produced and will set the limit for the rest of the measurements.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our all important power versus distortion+noise at 300 ohm:The higher noise and distortion in the dashboard comes into play here putting the MX3 fair bit behind its look-alike, Topping DX3 Pro.  At 33 milliwatt power before clipping, there is not sufficient amount for a desktop amplifier.  Then again if you listen to the DX3 Pro in low gain, there is more power here than there.Using 33 ohm load we examine the current delivery of the headphone amplifier:Similar story here except 230 milliwatts is good amount of power for low impedance headphones.I was pleasantly surprised to see a very low output impedance in MX3:This means you can use any headphone with the MX3 and not have its frequency response change because of output impedance.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsOur dashboard for power amplifier calls for 5 watts of output:The amplifier is quite a bit worse than the DAC, showing a disappointing SINAD   of just 68 dB.  This is not performance you want to brag about to your friends:Here is the full power curve into 4 ohm load:Usually amplifiers keep reducing their THD+N as the signal gets stronger relative to noise.  Not so here.  Distortion is high enough that at just 1 watt, it starts to dominate and flattens the curve until clipping at about 30 watts.  More power can be had if you get it spike up a bit as shown so the unit meets its spec of I think 40 watts into 4 ohm.Here is the THD+N versus power versus frequency:The issue here is rising distortion in high frequencies regardless of amount of power being output.  1 kHz test tone we use in the dashboard then is almost the best case scenario.  By the way, the above test was performed with Aux input so that I could vary the input voltage as I do with other power amplifiers.Here is out signal to noise ratio:So not quite as good as CD's dynamic range.Listening TestsI only tested the headphone amplifier this way.  I will at some point start testing with speakers.With Sennheiser HD-650 high impedance headphone, there was good bit of power giving a physical sensation of bass.  Alas, by then distortion would set it and the sound would get bright and corrupted.Things changed with much lower impedance Hifiman HE-400i.  There was plenty of volume here and I had to try really hard to get it to distort.  It would do so but at levels I did not want to listen to for more than a second or two.  Bass sensation was quite good bringing the full dynamic range out of these headphones which lesser powered headphone amplifiers cannot.ConclusionsThe only bright spot in the Topping MX3 performance is its headphone amplifier especially with low impedance headphones.  Outside of that, the MX3 disappoints.  While nothing is broken and design clearly verified  , the bar was set quite low to meet the price point. Is the MX3 transparent enough?  Probably for most people.  Is it transparent enough for me to recommend it?  No.  You are much better off with discrete components.  You will be paying more though to get that performance.Am I being too critical?  We had fish chips yesterday at our favorite waterfront restaurant and it cost $57 for the three of us.  Two of those meals and you can have the Topping MX3.  So the value is incredible.  Let me know what you think.  -\",\n",
       " ' Behringer A500 \"Reference\" Power amplifier.  I purchased this unit on suggestions from members from Amazon for just $199 including Prime shipping.Being targeted at the pro market, this is rack-mount unit with heft heatsinks on each side:Full compliment of inputs are provided from RCA to balanced XLR and TRS.  No input selector is provided though and the manual warns against simultaneous connection to more than one input.The plastic volume knobs feel cheap but otherwise, it seems to be a sturdy build.The manual says it has a class AB output stage.  I am assuming some kind of power rail voltage switching is used to keep power consumption generally low but I have not confirmed this.For my testing, I used a 4 ohm dummy load and balanced XLR inputs.  Let\\'s get into measurements and see how she did.EDIT: the first revision of this review had tested the A500 with the input switch set to bridged.  It has now been updated in proper stereo mode.MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our dashboard:Even though I was using balanced input and outputs from the amplifier, we see large contributions from noise from the power supply in the form of 120 Hz and multiple harmonics.  The harmonic distortion is quite high too with distortion spikes seemingly going on forever.  So even if the power supply was 100% quiet, it would likely still not get better distortion/sinad rating.  A dismal showing regardless, underperforming good DACs by whopping 40 db!Signal to noise ratio is rated at 100 and I get numbers reasonably close to it:Here is distortion versus power:Sad to see a class AB amp not be able to outdo the switching amp in the Topping TP60 with respect to distortion and noise where the two overlap.Thankfully the Behringer A500 has copious amount of power, producing nearly 170 watts prior to clipping.  Behringer\\'s rating is 180 watts at 1% distortion which seems like an honest rating.Frequency response is OK but not as flat as it should be for a power amp in the audible range:If there is rail supply switching, then it likely has an output filter to get rid of switching noise from that and as a result, start to roll off the response as we see above.I think we have a good picture of A500 performance so let\\'s not torture ourselves anymore.  ConclusionsWe seem to have a stream of bad luck with bargain amplifiers.  Sure, they provide exceptional value in how little they charge per watt.  I know I can\\'t make and ship the empty case of this amplifier for $199.  But still, we want good distortion specs that rise up at least to some of the worst DACs we have ever tested.  Heck, these numbers are no better than some analog formats!Given the high distortion levels and somewhat uneven frequency response, I can\\'t recommend the Behringer 500.  If you just want loud amplification, then you do have a bargain here.-',\n",
       " '   Sunfire Cinema Grand five channel power amp designed by Bob Carver.   a member. In 1996 it cost US $2,375. This unit is from 1999 and has had its caps upgraded.I can\\'t say I am a fan of this look.  The meter shows an obscure measurement of the \"power supply joules.\" The dial never moves so it is useless.Back panel shows some deviations from norm as well:In addition to normal speaker terminals, the front channels also have \"current output.\"  This just means that there is a 1 ohm resistor in series with the output.  This causes voltage/power loss that is inversely proportional to the impedance of the speaker.  As such, it varies the frequency response of the speaker so can have different tonality.There is balanced XLR input which is what I used for my testing.This amplifier is the third iteration of Bob Carver.  After leaving Phase Linear, he designed the \"Magnetic Field\" amplifier under the Carver name.  That product varies the AC duty cycle as a way to change the incoming AC voltage and with it, the output DC.  This lowers the losses in the output transistors since they don\\'t have to operate for worst case  .  See my review of Carver M-1.5t amplifier.  Bob then left and started Sunfire and with it, came this amplifier design.  Instead of crudely changing the AC duty cycle, this amplifier has a DC to DC converter which tracks the incoming music.  The higher the input level, the more it will increase its output voltage, thereby keeping the output transistors in their optimal voltage level.  Result again is very high efficiency compared to normal class AB design.  Let\\'s measure it to see how well it works.BTW, there are two versions of this: one at 200 watts and one at 400 watts.  Maybe I am going blind but I could not see any designation of such on the unit. Carver Cinema Grand Amplifier MeasurementsAs with the M-15.t, I noticed a lot of noise before I fed the unit a signal so let\\'s look at that:We see that the dc to dc converter is pass through a lot of AC noise and harmonics.  This impacts the performance of the unit:While second harmonic distortion dominates at -72 dB, the mains noise is not far behind, causing SINAD   to drop further to just 67 dB.  This is ranks pretty close to the bottom of all the amplifiers tested:SNR is not good as a result of that noise:Multitone at 5 watts suffers from both power supply spikes and high intermodulation distortion:Crosstalk is surprisingly poor:There seems to be inductive leakage at frequencies below 5 kHz which I am guessing is bleed through the shared power DC to DC converter.Oddest thing was the frequency response:There is some verbiage from Bob Carver about \"voicing\" the amplifier.  Perhaps this is intentional but then why is one channel different than the other?Claim to fame here is high power capability so let\\'s see if it delivers on that:It does indeed.  At the expense of noise and distortion but still, a 37 pound amplifier of the time, with 5 channels no less, would be in no position to produce such a power.The new DC to DC converter is regulated so no headroom power:There is healthy power at 8 ohm as well:I had to lower the input level substantially to get the amp to run the frequency dependence as it would pull back severely at higher frequencies:The lines are very high in vertical scale indicating high noise and distortion which we already know about.  What we had not seen is the difficulty the amp has with high frequencies.  This is likely due to the dc to dc converter not being able to track the voltage at higher frequencies.  Fortunately music naturally has far lower level at higher frequencies so actual impact is low.Finally, the amplifier is stable from power on:Scale is heavily exaggerated with the one channel improving just 1 dB.  And the other being stable from start.ConclusionsBob seems to have gotten the \"high order bit\" right in  uring out how to produce a high efficiency, high power amplifier.  Alas, much of the talk is about fidelity and in that department, this is a poor showing.  Mains noise gets through readily and distortion is quite high even by 1996 standards.  From buying used point of view, the cool running environment of this amp means that it ages very well so the risks are lower.  Then again that dc to dc converter brings a lot more complexity to the design.Overall, the Carver Cinema Grand is not something I would recommend.  But I can see people purchasing it as a lightweight, multichannel amplifier that delivers a lot of power.  To the extent you can purchase it for a lot less than modern class D amps, it would be a decent buy.P.S. no, I don\\'t have any more carver amps to test.    Nor did I seek them out.  They just happen to become available all around the same time.',\n",

They are sold out there though.Not a half-bad enclosure especially for the price:It was so confusing to see dual languages on the front panel and the back:I left the bass and treble controls as you see them there.  For testing, I adjusted the gain to 29 dB which is my standard for testing.Amazon Basics 80W MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amplifier a 1 kHz tone with enough amplitude to produce 5 watts and see what we get:Well, this is not good.  Distortion   is quite high at around 68 dB causing the SINAD to be pretty close to the bottom of all the amps we have tested:Frequency response showed high sensitivity relative to   load:Crosstalk was horrible:How the heck they screwed this up?  The dashed line in teal is a $25 amplifier.32-tone test shows what we saw in the dashboard more or less:We can\\'t clear 16 bit content even at max power:Power curve shows early onset of distortion:At least spec is met  :Sweeping with different frequencies we see distortion rises a lot with frequency:ConclusionsI am a sucker for a bargain as much as the next person.  But there comes a line that I hate to cross and this amplifier forces me to do so.  There are just so many faults here.  If you want to use it in a garage or workshop, it will be fine and run cooler than little desktop amps.  That is the only positive thing I can say about it.Needless to say, I can\\'t recommend the Amazon Basics 80 Watt amplifier.Edit: see teardown here:  always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any   ',\n",
       " ' OSD Nero Stream-XD analog and digital streaming   amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member for testing.  It costs US $230 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  There is a bit of heft to this box considering its budget category:There is a rotary control for volume and input selection.  Naturally with no display, you don\\'t know the volume level.  Various inputs are provided although USB is for storage device, not as a DAC:I focused my testing on analog and Toslink inputs.Like the inclusion of power supply in the unit which likely is the reason for some of its weight.  In use, it got warm to touch but nothing concerning.OSD Nero Stream-XD MeasurementsLet\\'s start with using the analog input and see how it does:Well, this is not good.  There is strange/high noise floor plus plenty of distortion.  Perhaps it digitizes the analog input?  Let\\'s test Toslink then:Same bad results.    It ranks way at the bottom of our rankings:Can the news get worse?  Yes, it can:There is a subwoofer output so maybe this is someone\\'s idea of high pass filter!  I looked in the manual and there are no tone controls that could be responsible for this.Let me just post the rest of the graphs and not waste words on a failing design:ConclusionsThis is a prime example of what we in the industry call \"phoned in design.\"  You call up a shop in China, given them your wish list and out comes an amp.  You do no testing yourself and put no requirements as far as performance on the shop that is \"designing\" it.  Result is all the checklist items marketing wants with performance not even on the back of the priority list.  Does it sound better than a sound bar when paired with a couple of speakers?  Should that frequency response not screw things up too bad, maybe.  For me?  I pass and get an AVR instead. -',\n",
       " ' Nubert nuConnect ampX digital integrated amplifier and wireless connector.  It was purchased by a member from the company in Germany and drop shipped to me.  The ampX costs €689  .The outside imparts confidence as far as weight and industrial design:Beauty is skin deep though.  The menu structure is very strange.  For example you hit the \"return\" button to get into options and then rotate the number to select.  Hitting return gets you back one step but never back to home menu above.  You have to select \"Volume\" and click on that to get back home.  I had the volume too high once as soon as I changed inputs and could not turn it down immediately.When you turn the unit off with the standby button on the left, a dim display remains saying ampX.  I hope that is not an OLED display or that would be burnt in after a short while.  Why do I need to see that text on the display?  The standby button already turns orange.The rear panel shows the plethora of option to feed the ampX:You have phono state, Bluetooth, and Wifi besides allt he other inputs.  What\\'s more using their app and the microphone in the phone you are supposed to be able to correct for room modes under 160 Hz  .Audio MeasurementsI started with our usual dashboard with USB input to ampX and speaker out at 5 watts:Boy, this is not good.  We have high noise floor plus ton sand tons of harmonics and we are at just 5 watts.  I thought may be analog input would be different so tested that:It is a different sort of bad but overall in the same bucket of \"well below average:\"Signal to noise ratio is verypoor:Never seen an amplifier that doesn\\'t improve its signal to noise ratio when you turn it up.  The noise must be getting amplified proportionally with volume.32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows the same problems:Look at those spikes in mid frequencies rising to almost -50 dB.  This is where our hearing is starting to get most sensitive.Frequency response was terrible with digital or analog inputs:There is a high pass filter which I could not  ure how to defeat so let it be at 10 Hz.  It must cause that terrible peaking at low frequencies.  Conversely, there is a sharp filter at 20 kHz which roll off starting even earlier.  We are down 3 dB by the time we get to 20 kHz.  And this is with digital input and sample rate of 96 kHz!Let\\'s test the power amp to full power starting at 4 ohm:That is a lot worse than a typical AVR.  Same is true with 8 ohm load:Thermal AnalysisPerformance improved a bit over half of running at 5 watts:ConclusionsI tell you: if manufacturers post measurements, I am sure they would have caught these issues themselves.  Even a marketing person would know the above frequency response would not sell a single unit.  But no.  Customers don\\'t ask for it so manufactures just throw a few numbers over the fence.  Those numbers did point to problems:We actually did better at 0.05%!  How they got this SNR, I don\\'t know :ConclusionsI get the appeal of \"do it all\" amplifier with modern streaming features.  But come on.  Let\\'s get the basics right.  The amp needs to be low noise and distortion and have flat response.  And spend some time make the unit easier to navigate.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Nubert nuConnect ampX.  It had high promise but did not remotely get there. -',\n",
       " \" Fosi Audio BT10A Bluetooth Class D stereo amplifier. The B10A seems to have just been updated with tone controls and sells for US $50 from Amazon with free prime shipping.This is a very small amplifier:You can't see the depth but it is quite shallow.  Other amps like this I have tested have complicated interface to change built-in digital tone controls.  There are none here so it was easy to use.The back connectors is identical to what you see on myriad of such amps:While the external laptop replacement power supply is large compared to the size of the unit, it is not as huge as some others.  Note that it comes with a three-prong,  ure-8 AC socket so you have less options to replace the cord.I did not bother testing the Bluetooth.  I am assuming it autoselects it if in range as the priority input as there is no switch to select it.Speaker terminals are tiny of course but I managed to plug in my heavy and large banana jacks into it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain  :Second harmonic dominates to the tune of -65 dB which sets the SINAD to the same value.  This says that noise is not a contributor to SINAD and as such, any gain setting would have produced similar SINAD.  The 65 dB SINAD value doesn't put a smile on anyone's face but it is a couple of steps above $30 units  :Noise  ures are barely adequate:32-tone test signal shows more or less uniform distortion at all frequencies:19+20 kHz tones shows 55 dB of distortion-free range:Their full   amplitude shows higher distortions than multitone test does.Frequency response shows truncated low and high frequencies:Above with a resistor load.  Subjective the amp to my new complex speaker model of a 2-way speaker generates:The speaker model has a its impedance shooting up in high frequencies causing similar issue here.  There is a question of whether the model is similar to mass of 2-way speakers so don't run with this yet.  What you can conclude is that the speaker choice does impact the speaker response.  In audible band though, the impact is minimal and in some way is correcting the dip toward 20 kHz.  A good amp would have no speaker load dependency.Let's see how much power the BT10A can produce into 4 ohm load:At 33 watts with both channels driven this is good bit of power.  Similar story with 8 ohm load:Lack of power is by far the #1 issue in these amplifiers.  You may not be able to hear their noise and distortions but you absolutely will hear them complain when they clip.  At these power levels you should have a reasonable experience unlike some other budget amps that stop at 10 watts or so.Allowing for more distortion   and testing with a short-term sinewave and long term produces identical numbers:The input power supply is regulated so there is no reservoir to provide short-term juice. Thermal StabilityPerformance gradually improved by a 2 dB or so after 30 minutes of playing at 5 watts:Above tests were performed after this warm-up period.ConclusionsThe Fosi Audio BT10A doesn't seem half bad.  I am not going to provide a verdict one way or the other.  You can decide for yourself if the performance is good enough for your application. -\",\n",
       " ' Audio Research Corporation   100.2 stereo power amplifier. The 100.2 came out in year 1998 at a cost of US $2,995.  It was later raised to US $3,495.  If I remember correctly, the owner told me this the last solid state amplifier ARC produces before going to all tube route.The 100.2 is as solid as a rock:The back panel is as you expect with the exception of   speaker binding posts:In use the 100.2 cooked and cooked good.  I measured 45 to 47 degrees C on the heatsinks.  The internal temps are likely much higher.  I read that it uses unobtanium output MOSFET transistors so if they go, you likely have a giant door stop.    In use though the 100.2 did not complain one bit and ran through all of my tests.Strangely when you power the unit down, it takes it a while to do that.  What it is doing, I don\\'t know.The design of the unit is based on low feedback factor of just 6 dB.  Based on that alone I can tell you it is not going to perform well.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWe have huge power supply peaks, like due to poor power supply rejection ratio of low feedback design.  Second and third harmonic dominate the distortion profile resulting in lackluster SINAD of just 65 dB.  That lands the ARC 100.2 near the bottom of some 72 amplifiers tested so far:Frequency response is excellent:Response changes some with a simulated 2-way speaker load but nothing to cry over:Multitone test shows the high distortion products of the power supply:And rather high noise floor which we can directly measure using signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk shape is odd but not an audible concern:Amplifier Power MeasurementsThe sins of low feedback factor stare at you in the face with our 4 ohm load:Yes, distortion gradually increases but then it clips anyway.  So why not have clean power until clipping???Same deal into 8 ohms:At least it slightly exceeds its power specifications.Strangely burst power   doesn\\'t generate much more power:Keeping THD+N constant at 0.1% gives us incredibly low and strange amount of power:There is so much distortion and noise in the output of this amp that you don\\'t get much power if you set your goal at 0.1% THD  .  FYI I ran the above at 0.2% THD+N   and it produced about 80 watts with a straight line.  Anyway, who says only class D amps have trouble with this test?Amplifier Thermal stabilityI powered the unit cold and let it run nearly half hour while recording distortion and noise. This is what I got:That is very high degree of improvement.  Again, low feedback means that it is more sensitive to operating temperature.  Given the high heat dissipation, it is a tough deal to have to also keep the unit on for a while to get the best performance.ConclusionsSigh.  The best analogy I can think of here is if car owners said, \"you know, a car should have more square tires\" and manufacturers running to build cars that way.  Yes, audio folklore says feedback is a bad thing.  Well, I have news for you: distortion is really, really bad thing.  As is noise.  It surely doesn\\'t give you \"blacker background\" if it has higher noise, does it?I read some place that it has less feedback so it can deliver less phase shift.  Do folks not know that you have reflections in your room, every one of which arrives at your ears with a different delay and hence phase?  That they all mix up and as a result, the brain discards that info?  If it did not, we would go crazy trying to make sense of people talking to us in indoor situations.  Anyway, we digress.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the ARC 100.2.  Serviceability will be poor and so will the performance. -',\n",

My back is still complaining....There is no benefit to having a differential power amplifier but seems like they a pair of amps are used out of phase to double the power per channel:The switchmode power supply changes supply rail on   to keep power consumption low at lower power levels  .  In my testing, the DR2 barely got warm so the mechanism is working.Emotiva XPA-DR2 MeasurementsI was expecting good measurements but instead got this:Wow, look at the harmonic spray starting at third one.  SINAD of 64 dB ranks almost at the bottom of nearly 150 amplifiers tested:Not good.Fortunately signal to noise ratio is excellent so this is a quiet amplifier:Frequency response and crosstalk are fine:Multitone test though shows the high distortion across the frequency band:The main meal here is power into 4 and 8 ohm loads versus distortion+noise:That\\'s incredible amount of power.  Alas it is delivered with lots of distortion.  Back to the power, check out the max and peak power:And this is on a shared 20 amp 120 volt outlet.  I don\\'t think we have measured any other amplifier that comes close to this level of output.Similar story holds   for 8 ohm:As you see the curve looks nothing like other amplifiers where they are first noise limited until clipping sets in.  Here, distortion is front and center even at 50 milliwatts!We get a look at the architecture of this amplifier by sweeping power at different frequencies:We have a constant glitch around 20 to 50 watts which I am assuming is the amplifier switching rails to higher voltage.  We also have rising distortion as seen in the previous graphs even at low power.ConclusionsAssuming I don\\'t have to carry it much, I love the build and great value as far as $/watt and maximum amount of power available.  SNR is also good so you should be free of speaker hiss.  Distortion is high though and there is no getting around it.  Will you hear it?  At 60 dB it is probably borderline for most people.I can\\'t recommend the Emotiva XPA-DR2 due to its high distortion.  Otherwise, it is a very tempting package. -',\n",

What you get is a three board assembly:It took less than 5 minutes to put the heatsink on the main class D amp chip and sandwich the main board with the top and bottom.  The chip used must be for smart speakers as it has voice prompts when you change inputs.  Speaking of that, it has Bluetooth  , analog and USB in.  The little heatsink has no air flow and in testing, it got quite hot to touch at times.For testing, I used my lab power supply and set the output voltage to 24 volts  .  The supply has  3 Amps max current.  Amplifier is rated for dual 50 watts at that voltage input.UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier MeasurementsI started testing with analog input with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain:Considering the price, this is not half bad:I kludged up a USB type A to type A cable and ran the dashboard test again:As you see performance is not as good as analog input.  Worse yet, just a few seconds later, it lost stability and would no longer work reliably.  If I powered it down, it would work for a second or two and then go crazy again. It may be a design issue or my setup.  Either way, I could only continue with analog input testing.Noise floor is high as you can see in the FFT graphs above:Crosstalk managed to be worse than the worst I have tested so far:Multitone shows increased distortion at both ends of the spectrum:The most important test for class D amps shows strong load dependency:So the tonality you get will depend on speaker you hook up to it.As usual, we fall way short of stated power levels:8 Ohm performance was a bit better:Response vs frequency is smooth but that may be due to high noise floor which masks distortion:Amplifier Listening TestsI hooked up one channel to my Infinity Reference 253 speaker and starting to listen.  There was a lot more power than I expectedly, likely due to only having to drive one channel.  The sound was surprisingly good until you cranked it to max volume.  Speaking of which, if I paused input, the last 25% of the volume range produced tweeter hiss that was audible to about 1 meter/3 feet.I was very satisfied with subjective performance until I landed on two clips, both of which were busy with both bass and treble notes.  On these two tracks, the sound was very distorted at almost all volume levels.  High frequencies would get gritty and distorted and bass response was bad as well.  I power cycled the unit and let it cool and it seemed to play well for a couple of seconds and then would get distorted.  It may be that the crest factor is too low causing the amp to drive hard most of the time with these two tracks.  And then it overheats and distorts.ConclusionsThe first amplifier I ever built   was this massive board and produced only 10 watts a channel.  It also cost us many months of allowance.  Compare that to this amplifier which for the price of a fast food meal for two, gives you stereo sound that most of the time is impressively good.  If it did not distort on those two channels, I would say you could build an amp with two of them and be in business.Given the distortion/heat issue, I can't recommend the UWAYKEY amplifier. -\",\n",
       " \" Ashly NE8250 professional 8-channel networked power amplifier.     costs US $2,386.The look and controls are fine. It is going in a rack after all. Note that back connections are all phoenix blocks:You can make your own cables or buy adapters  . There is a nice network UI interface and app.Ashly NE8250 MeasurementsAll measurements are from channels 3 and 4.  Let's start with our dashboard:That is huge amount of harmonic distortion, placing the amp almost at the bottom of our SINAD list:Strangely, in a good way, noise floor is low:Frequency response droops at either end but surprisingly it is not load dependent despite being Class D design:Crosstalk is fine:Multitone shows poor performance that we would expect:You buy these amps for power so let's see how it does at 4 ohm:Ouch!  That distortion curve is crazy.  It almost act like a tube amp or something!  Distortion is so high when it clips that when we measure at 1%, we actually get less power:Switching to 8 ohm doesn't help:Sweeping the frequencies we see this pronounced hump:So my guess is that it is a class G design but company says Class D.ConclusionsThe distortion in this amplifier is just out of control.  It is also not every powerful on a per channel basis.  So I don't see it having a good application for home use in either main or sub amplifier.  It is also expensive so I don't see the value in it either.  Then again the owner said they come up much cheaper on ebay so maybe that would be some motivation to buy it.I can't recommend the Ashly NE8250.  Your ears deserve better!

       " ' Earthquake XJ-300ST stereo amplifier. It was kindly donated by a member for testing. It costs US $462.83 from the company website.I like the compact packaging and old school but solid feeling switchgear.  Likewise, having a low-pass filter  , filter corner frequency and phase come in handy.  And of course the integrated volume control.  Back panel is typical with the exception of crossing terminals  :12 volt trigger is icing on the cake.Unit runs is a \"class J\" amplifier and was cool and comfortable during testing.  Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:We have massive mains spike which I could hardly reduce no matter what I did.  I am assuming it is internal leakage.  Can\\'t  ure out why one channel is so much more distorted than the other.  Averaging the two, the amp falls in \"poor\" category of all tested with a SINAD of 59:Frequency response showed strong roll off at both ends of the spectrum:There is a note about a 15 Hz high pass but nothing about the top end.    programmable lowpass by more or less setting it to 80 Hz and got this:Crosstalk is very poor:SNR was poor likely due to high levels of power supply/mains noise:Power is modest:I have no idea how they have arrived at their power spec:Finally, here is the 8 ohm performance:ConclusionsNot much to hang your head on here other than the compact size and functionality.  Not sure how it is suitable for subwoofer duty when it has so little power.  Can\\'t recommend it. -',\n",
       " ' Crown XLi 800 pro Power Amplifier. The XLi 800 costs just US $269 including free shipping.  Hard to imagine so much electronics from a brand name company selling for so little.NOTE: my company   is a dealer for Harman and sells a lot of Crown amplifiers.EDIT: I left out the letter \"B\" out of class AB below.  I don\\'t know anyone who is building class B audio amplifiers.Unlike some of the switching amplifiers from Crown, this is a class AB amplifier with seemingly linear power supply as it is quite heavy.  From the outside though, it look like countless other commercial amplifiers:There are two gain controls in addition to very useful clipping indicators.  Speaking of clipping, there is a compressor in there that limits power output to maximum no matter how much you increase its input.  It is a nice feature that is surely there to stop the amp from stressing while saving a speaker from blowing up due to a mistake upstream.The back panel is as you expect:In use the unit never even got warm.  I had headphones on so did not take note of when/if the fans came on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s see how the XLi 800 does in our usual dashboard at 5 watt output into 4 ohm using a 1 kHz tone:Ouch!  We have very high distortion of 0.13 to 0.16%.  The spec is 0.5% so it is within what they say but this is very high.  Translated into SINAD   our 57 dB value sinks into the bottom range of all amplifiers measured so far:Signal to noise ratio at 5 watt is nothing to write home about either:Frequency response is fairly flat and predictable:Power into 4 ohm relative to THD+N gives us:That is a lot of power.  And tremendous value at just 50 cents per watt. As one would predict, we lose some of that into 8 ohm:Determining maximum power and peak with 1% THD+N gives us these:We have fair bit of headroom there.I had a hard time measuring power across full spectrum at a given THD+N due to the amp limiting power  .  Only managed to capture 0.9% and 0.5% THD+N power here:As we would expect, we get less power at low frequencies because they tax the power supply more.  Oh, the text on graph is wrong: should say 1% not 0.1%.Finally, here is our frequency sensitivity relative to power and distortion+noise:Best distortion is usually at lower frequencies and here, the improvement is quite good at 20 Hz.  Alas, we also get less power before clipping  .Otherwise, the lines are quite predictable with no funny non-linearity mid span as we get with some amplifiers.ConclusionsCrown advertises the XLi 800 as a PA   amplifier and that is what it is.  Distortion and noise is kept in check just enough to do the job with tons of power for so little money.  I suspect it is reliably too given the dual fans to keep it cool.  And the market it is being sold into.For hi-fi use, it is not something I would consider to drive full-range speakers.  For subwoofer or active woofer duty, it would be fine.As it is, I can\\'t recommend the XLi 800. -',\n",
       " ' SMSL Q5 Pro DAC and stereo integrated amplifier. The Q5 Pro costs US $140 from Amazon with Prime shipping.The sample sent to me is \"well used:\"If you were a real audiophile, you would think those scratches change the cabinet resonances leading to less black backgrounds, micro detail and PRAT.  But since you are not, let\\'s read on.  Here is the back panel:The owner sent me two power supplies.  The other one outputs 24 volts but since it says on the back the limit is 19, I went with this one.  Heaven knows if I blew it up, I could not buy another one and scratch it up the same way this one is!  Strangely if I squint, the fuzzy picture on SMSL website shows the other power supply.As you see, you have both digital and analog inputs.  I tested both as you see below.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s start with analog input performance:Well, that is not good.  One channel is producing far more distortion.  And noise level is quite high.  Switching to USB input improves the good channel significantly:The bad channel is insisting on producing far more distortion.  Averaging the two, we get a SINAD score that is pretty much at the bottom of our rankings:From here on, I stuck with USB input since it performs better.  Frequency response was refreshingly good:Power into 4 ohm load shows poor response:Doesn\\'t get much better into 8 ohm:And we are way off the spec.  But that is typical.  Or maybe it needs the higher voltage power supply.Thermal stabilityNot much was changing after power up:ConclusionsIt is one thing to have random performance when an amp is $50 or so.  But once you get to $140, I expect better than what SMSL Q5 Pro delivers.  If you want a little baby amp, get the SMSL SA100.  It behaves better and is much cheaper.  So no recommendation from me. -',\n",
       " ' Rockville RPA16 \"Professional\" power amplifier.     drop shipped to me. It costs US $390.The amp has a \"peak\" spec of 10,000 watts!  No, there is no typo in there. It weights 40 pounds/18 KG so it does have some meat to it.  You can probably see the bolt that holds the power transformer on top left. So no switching power supply at least.  Back panel shows nice sub out option:The fan is variable speed and is mostly quiet at idle.  But even under modest power it spools up as temps climb, making a slightly whining sound:The front controls are analog actually but notched, making it harder to select an exact value.  They are out of sync with each other so one notch is not the same as the other.  The displayed amount is also off by a couple of dB  .  There is a built-in limiter and clipping light.Rockville RPA16 MeasurementsLet\\'s jump right in with our dashboard:That is very odd set of spikes in low frequencies.  We have the mains 60 Hz noise but also 70 Hz.  At this power level though, spray of distortion at -62 dB sets SINAD though, causing it to rank as one of the worse tested:Its score of 55 dB is so low that it pulled down our overall median by 1 dB to 78!Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts, likely due to that power supply noise.  But there is so much power that when you push it, the ratio is not bad:Multitone test shows that distortion naturally gets worse at higher frequencies:Frequency response is nice and load independent indicating a non-switching amplifier:You have a choice of two roll offs for sub output.  Strangely both boost the gain as well:Let\\'s see how accurate the power specs are  :Naturally we don\\'t get there but this is one powerful amplifier, generating nearly 1500 watts with both channels combined.Letting distortion go up and with shorter term signal we get even more of it:I don\\'t think we have measured this much power before, have we?Even at 8 ohm you have a ton of power:As noted though, noise floor is high, again, I think the worst measured.  Distortion actually doesn\\'t set in until 100+ watts.Checking for frequency vs power and distortion we see orderly response:If you are using it for sub, you want to use the above number, rather than the 1 kHz power tests shown earlier.  Fortunately this is still a ton of power considering dual channels are driven.Finally, I ran a wideband spectrum test to confirm the design is not switching:And it is not.  There is also good filtering to push the noise levels down so low above a few hundred kilohertz. ConclusionsThis is an interesting take on a pro amplifier to go with non-switching design.  This makes the amp extremely heavy compared to competition yet, the price is maintained and absurdly low.  Copious amount of power is available if you can tolerate some fan noise.Due to high level of noise I can\\'t recommend the Rockville RPA16.  But you are welcome to choose otherwise based on other factors. ',\n",
       " ' Carver M-1.5t vintage stereo amplifier. It was kindly sent to me by a member.The M-1.5t came in an era where rack mounting meant serious business. As a Carver   owner myself, I remember all the advertising for the M-1.5t.  Oddly, there is no power switch anywhere:I got a chuckle seeing that monster cable tag:And found the power specs ridiculously complicated but I am sure was appreciated by the aficionadas of the amp:The front LEDs don\\'t light up until it is putting out a lot of power.  I liked the top LED which was the limiting lights and nice protection circuit which kept the unit on no matter what.  This amp was part of Carver \"Magnetic Field\" amplification line which varied the power supply voltage to substantially reduce the size and weight of the transformer.  As a result, the unit ran quite cool, maybe a bit warmer than modern class D but still, impressive for the time.The owner has replaced the capacitors in this unit.  Otherwise I think it is untouched.Carver M-1.5t MeasurementsI can see why there is no power switch as the amp did not stabilize for the 14 minutes I measured it:The level of instability is quite large, going beyond 10 db variation in SINAD!  I am used to seeing 1 or 2 dB, but nothing at this level.When I had the unit connected, and before I fed it signal, I could see constant switching noise:Not sure what that is about.  Here is our dashboard at 5 watts with 1 kHz tone:Third harmonic dominates distortion profile and with it, SINAD  .  Average SINAD of 55 dB for both channels is far, far below that median for all amplifiers I have tested to date  .  On top of distortion, we have massive pulse train which oddly starts at 40 Hz.  So definitely not very clean.SNR though was better:Frequency response was nice, flat and extended:Crosstalk was \"OK:\"Multitone shows more than usual increase in distortion vs frequency:Front of the unit says it has low feedback which is likely responsible for this.Claim to fame is lots of power so let\\'s see how it does:We see a distinct jump in distortion at around 66 watts which must be when it switches to higher power supply voltage.  Allowing for copious amount of distortion, there is good bit of power at 273 watts.  Here is the same at 8 ohm:Now let\\'s test peak performance:There definitely is a lot of headroom, allowing power to almost double!  The 600 watt number and such must have been at higher distortion levels than what I allow.Testing for frequency sensitivity we again see the higher distortion at higher frequencies:20 Hz performance also dropped with rising distortion at just 20 watts.Finally, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:ConclusionsIt is nice to test products that were iconic during my youth with state of the art measurements that didn\\'t even exist then.  Using that, we see that in noise and distortion the M-1.5t is outgunned by vast number of amplifiers today.  However, it produces copious amount of power which would have been even more impressive then.  The efficiency rivals class D amps today which was unheard of at the time.Looking online, I see that non-upgraded but working units go for $500 or so.  They seem to be a decent alternative to pro class D amp if you have a soft spot in your heart for vintage amplifiers.   ',\n",
       " ' SMSL SA100 Stereo Audio Amplifier with analog and Bluetooth inputs.  It was kindly sent to me by the member @lunagreenjp who is a distributor for SMSL.  The SA100 costs just US $73.99 on Amazon including shipping.Form the outside the SA100 matches its sibling, the M100 DAC:Pushing the power button multiple times lets you select between Aux RCA in and Bluetooth.  Pushing and holding the volume control lets you select Bass and Treble amounts.  I was surprised that the unit had shipped with both set to max instead of zero.The volume control works well and overall, you feel like you are getting more than the $74 price indicates.Here is the back panel:An external \"laptop style\" switching supply powers the unit.  It is almost as large as the SA100 itself although not as thick.I was pleased that my rather large and unwieldy banana speakers securely mated with the jacks on the SA100.Overall, my impression is positive about the look and feel of this little, and I mean little, integrated amplifier.The heart of the unit is TPA3116D2  class-D amplifier IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect it is made for Bluetooth speakers and such.  In use the SA100 ran cool no matter how hard I pushed it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:As is typical of amplifiers with volume control, one can get slightly different results depending on how you set the input level relative to volume control on the unit itself.  The above is with volume control set to -1 I think.High distortion dominates the output resulting in one of the worst numbers we have measured with respect to SINAD  :Frequency response droops at both end some:The sharp drop after 20 kHz tells me that input is perhaps digitized to provide tone control?Signal to noise ratio \"OK\" for the class:Measuring distortion and noise relative to output power with 8 and 4 ohm gets us:Distortion sets it very early and climbs after that.  Specified power ratings are quite inflated as is typical of these chip amps.The sharp filter limit the measurement of harmonic distortion when we sweep frequency and power level:The red curve for example is for 20 kHz but since we can\\'t see any of its harmonics, it looks artificially low.Here is the spectrum of a 1 kHz tone without any kind of filter  :Speaking of filter, even though I used an AES-17 filter to get rid of ultrasonic noise, the level was still so high as to confuse my Audio Precision analyzer.  It would often not be able to capture the input signal properly.ConclusionsIf we measured the SMSL SA100 on an absolute level, it would rank horribly of course.  But I don\\'t think that is proper here.  The SA100 costs so little and probably gets use in tertiary applications such as a workshop amp to drive cheap speakers you don\\'t mind getting stolen or destroyed.  And maybe for casual desktop use. -',\n",
       " ' Carver Crimson 275 tube stereo power amplifier. It was purchased new by member @paulbottlehead and given to me for testing. It costs US $2750.I really like the way the amplifier looks.  The burgundy color is attractive as is the handle.  On the latter, the unit is very light though so the handle while handy, is not necessary to lift the thing.  Back panel shows high quality connectors:The tubes, four Tun-sol KT120, pair of 12AT7W and 12AX7 can in their original boxes for the owner installation. Went to open one of the small tube boxes but found nothing in it!  Worried, I looked around and it had come out of its box and was just floating in the larger box that they all came in.Prior to installation of tubes I had something to investigate: there was clearly something loose in there, rattling around.  So I took the back panel off to find a metal screw rolling around in there:Not sure where it was supposed to go.  There is a hole for something above the second fuse from the bottom but I think that would for a nut.I did not like lack of safety   ground from the IEC terminal:Instead, there is some kind of local, star grounding referenced to neutral using a resistor.  That naturally won\\'t work for safety purposes.  With that power supply board mounted vertically with voltages as high as 300+ volts, I sure as heck would want this metal case grounded.  I don\\'t care what audio/electrical problem they were trying to solve there.  I want a safe product first and foremost.  Naturally there is no safety/regulatory certification which I expect a company with the name \"Carver\" to be able to afford.I got a kick out of the beefy speaker terminals but ultra-thin wires leading to it!  Yes, the lengths are short and at this wattage is probably fine but from \"optics\" point of view, you would want to use something better than hair thin wiring  .I was sad to see the VU meter glued to the case:I realize welding a couple of threaded stand-offs to the case costs money but at this price, I expect such.  The meter is not backlit which was another disappointment.  But was useful for checking bias which was right at the spec at 100 milliamps.So nice looks but under the skin, a number of concerns.Carver Crimson 275 MeasurementsI usually let amplifiers warm up some and watch their behavior and also let things stabilize before measurements.  Manual states that bias can be checked after 20 minutes so I let it run for that long and a bit more:Note that the vertical scale is only 3 dB so don\\'t be alarmed by the variations.  Generally speaking, unit is table after a couple of minutes of warm up. But it is fascinating to see performance gradually get worse as it kept warming up  .So next comes our usual dashboard.  My Audio Precision analyzer by default has floating   RCA terminals.  But I had to override that by grounding it as I observed oscillations  .  No other attempt at grounding made a difference in power supply/mains hum:The power supply noise really dirties up the FFT spectrum but looking past that, we see that the low SINAD   is dominated by distortion.  Unlike the common reputation for tubes, distortion is third harmonic for the most part, not second.  Naturally the high level of distortion places the 275 very low in our scale, second only to one other amp ever tested:Company spec is quite good for noise level relative to full power.  I could not get that without a-weighting:But applying the a-weighting filter and with it, getting rid of power supply noise, we do essentially get there:Crosstalk was poor:Frequency response has an odd shape and good bit of loss at high frequencies with 4 ohm load:Output impedance is high enough that is combining with the load to change the high frequency roll off.  Things get better as such with an 8 ohm load:There is an RC filter on the speaker terminals.  Wonder if that is what is providing the roll off.Using 32 tones to simulate \"music\" we see a high level of \"grass\" which would obscure any low level detail:Notice how the worse performance is in low frequencies.There has been controversy regarding ability of the 275 to produce its rated power of 75 watts so let\\'s start with 4 ohm load as I usually do:The amplifier produced 29 watts after which it blew its 3 amp mains fuse.  Fortunately two spares were provided, allowing me to continue testing.  Company specs distortion at \"less than 1%\" so let\\'s see power at that rating:Very dramatic difference between 1 or 2 second power   vs short bursts.  There is clearly a capacity problem to produce sustained power.  Note that this is at 1 kHz as is industry convention.  Note that allowing just 1% THD reduces the power even more than what I allowed in my power sweep.I was surprised to not see selectable output impedance for 8 ohm load so proceed with the test as is:We blew the second fuse but now power is much more healthy at 60 watts.Hoping to not blow the last fuse, I kept the max power level lower as I changed frequencies:Performance was \"reasonable\"   but once we got down to 20 Hz, it became super erratic and blew the third fuse.   It produced only 14 wats which is well short of 30 watts it produced at higher frequencies.  I would have wanted to test at more frequencies but it was past midnight and I did not feel like hunting around to find my own replacement fuses.ConclusionsAs a Carver owner of 40 years  , I have a soft spot for the designer.  Alas, while I like some things about this amp like the nice looking paint, I am very disappointed in the QC and construction of the unit with respect to safety.  Loose screws and glued meters should not be part of a nears $3,000 amplifier.  Measured performance is awful of course and one would expect that for many audiophile tube amps.  But having third harmonic be dominant blows away the story of why that is audibly a good thing.  Clearly the specifications of the amplifier is incorrect for 4 ohm load  .  And low frequency behavior is very poor.Unless you are going to buy the Carver Crimson 275 to just look at it, I can\\'t recommend it for many reasons stated above.  I expect more from the man, the legend....P.S. It was nice to take a break from drying up our flooded home and get back to some \"normalcy\" with testing this amp.

       " ' Carver Raven 350 tube monoblock amplifier.       costs US $4,750.The 350 is not a bad looking amp. It has the same \"orange peel\" paint job of the previous Carver 275 amplifier I reviewed.  At 42 pounds, the unit is pretty heavy.  With all the weight in the back, the front handle is kind of useless when it comes to lifting it.There is an XLR input but I believe it is for convenience and performs the same as RCA.   DC resistance of the 4 and 8 ohm terminals   and realized they are both the same!  Here I was switching back and forth between them.   Anyway, measured DC resistance is 0.47 ohm. The 1-2 ohm tap has a lower DC resistance of about 0.3 ohm.Unlike the 275 amplifier, the fuses did not blow and the amp survived my sweep tests.  Bias is to be set at \"80\" on the front dial and that was the case when I powered on the unit.There is a gain control but you are advised to set it to max which is what I did for testing.There is a flip switch in the front which changes the amount of feedback.    amp in both settings.Here are the specs:Carver 350 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with high-feedback performance using XLR input:There is copious amount of distortion causing SINAD to be dominated by it.  At 44.1, it ranks as the second worst amplifier ever tested:It even performed worse than the Carver 275 which had a SINAD of 46.  Switching to lower feedback doesn\\'t make things that much worse:Note that gain is reduced and therefore, volume will be different. This makes AB testing tricky.  Here is a more detailed FFT showing the small difference between low and high feedback:Notice how distortion is made up of both 2nd and 3rd harmonics so you can\\'t make the argument that it is \"2nd harmonic goodness.\"As noted, RCA performance is the same as XLR:Power supply 60 Hz noise in both cases causes severe intermodulation higher up in frequency. No amount of grounding impacted that so it is endemic tot he design.Noise performance is decent for type of amp it is:Intermodulation distortion rears its ugly head again in multitone test:I don\\'t know how anyone could hear more \"detail\" with such an amp where so much of the music signal will get lost in the distortion \"grass.\"Frequency response should be flat but it is not:It naturally will have load dependency due to output impedance.Let\\'s see the power situation as we had serious shortfall in the 275 amp:We don\\'t meet the spec there but come closer with 8 ohm:Back to 4 ohm, here is our 1% THD   max and burst power:We seem to get the same shortfall.  There is momentary reservoir though allowing the peak output to shoot way up.  This was not always consistent though.I also tested 2 ohm capability:You are still current limited so no more power.Changing the test frequency gives us the following power curves:There is some instability at 20 Hz and fairly significant power drop.  This points to power supply not having enough capacity as the lower frequency taxes it for longer period.  Some drop occurs in every amplifier by the way so it is a matter of how much.Finally, the amplifier warms up quickly and is pretty stable:Testing occurred after this warm up.ConclusionsWhat an upside down the world of audio is. Folks want to pay so much more to get dirtier sound.  You want dirty?  The Carver 350 gives it to you. Even at 5 watts there is copious amount of harmonic distortion.

       " ' Pass ACA Class A stereo power amplifier.  It is a DIY design by the famous designer, Nelson Pass, meant to be starter amplifier for people new to audio electronics to build.  There are many kits available. The one loaned to me from a long time friend of the forum.  The kit seems to cost around US $320 or so.The ACA sample I received comes in an attractive black case:The design is a Mosfet output stage with a single stage buffer.  Very modest level of feedback   is provided to keep distortion somewhat under control.  As you will see, the gain is very low requiring full 2 volt of DACs to drive it to max power.Here is the back side:I did not mess with it but I am assuming the single XLR allows bridged mono operation.Power is provided by a very beefy external switching power supply which outputs 24 volts with up to 5 amps or 120 watts.  All of that is put to \"use\" in generating copious amount of heat.  I was told by the owner to let it warm up for a few minutes.  As you will see in the measurements, this actually made the performance worse, not better.Overall, this is a very nice package if it performs.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard with 5 watt output into 4 ohm.  Normally this is well below the max power but not in this case as we see later:Gosh... What happened to aiming for high fidelity?  This is a distortion-factory if there ever was one.  The notion that it is mostly second harmonic does not hold true either.  Welcome to the bottom of our amplifier ratings:Let\\'s dig into distortion spectrum at lower power level of just 1 watt:Second harmonic is more dominant than at 5 watt but it doesn\\'t stay there that long.  Here it is at 2 watts:Our 32-tone signal resembling \"music\" paints an ugly picture as a result:I was pleasantly surprised how quiet the unit is though:Frequency response is also very well extended:You may be able to make an AM radio out of this thing.  Back to ugliness, here is our power versus distortion+noise into 8 ohm load:Oh gosh again.... Only 7 watts of power with SINAD of 38 dB?Things don\\'t get much better with 4 ohm load:We now have distortion climbing into near 10% category at max power of just 7.4 watts/channel.There was little variation of response with respect to frequency:Distortion level is so high that it is masking secondary sources of it.Making sure this unit matches the reference, I compared them to what Nelson Pass has published:We are getting very good agreement.  So this is what the unit is supposed to do.  Nelson stays with 1 watt output which shows the performance to be better.EDIT: I noted on the dashboard that the gain was much lower than the spec.  I am told that version 1.6 which I tested now has a spec of 10 dB for gain so we are good.EDIT 2: See this link for bridged mode measurements:  TestsIs this thing on?  That is the expression that immediately came to mind after I hooked up the ACA amp to my Sonus Faber Concertino bookshelf speaker. Granted, the Concertino is spec\\'ed at 86 dB efficiency but come on, I could barely hear it.  There was no bass naturally. But not much above that either.  And this was with my Topping DX3 Pro at full volume.For grins, I plugged the US $74 tiny little SMSL SA100 Amplifier which I recently reviewed  into the setup.  Now the speakers came alive, with lots of bass, great dynamic range, and detail.  Yes, the amp started to cry when I turned it up much but until that point, it left the ACA so far in the dust it was not even funny.ConclusionsAs a starter hobby amplifier to get some sound coming out of a speaker, with relatively few components, the Pass ACA Class A Amp does the job.  Build it, have fun with it and then put it aside and get a proper amplifier.  Amplifiers need to have a lot more power.  And much less distortion.  We are not even close here folks.Do I need to tell you that I can\\'t recommend the Pass ACA for hi-fi listening?  I hope not. -']"

       "'  Primare A358   As the A358 has classD output stages all measurements other than frequency response were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which mitigates noise above 80kHz and eliminates noise above 200kHz   Without the filter 325mV of ultrasonic noise was present at each pair of loudspeaker terminals with a center frequency of 396kHz Because the AUX0025 filter is a twochannel device I could only measure two of the Primares eight channels at a time Almost all the measured performance was taken from channels 6 and 8 with the bridgedmode tests performed with channels 5 and 6 linked and channels 7 and 8 linked I dont precondition classD amplifiers before testing but after an hours operation the top panels temperature had stabilized at a warm 1022°F  As with Primares twochannel A352 that Herb Reichert reviewed in May 2020 the A358s balanced inputs offered 6dB lower voltage gain into 8 ohms than the singleended inputs at 1995dB compared with 2595dB   The voltage gains in bridged mode were identical but they were exactly 6dB higher in bridged 6 mode The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both balanced and unbalanced input signals in both normal and bridged modes The balanced input impedance was close to the specified 36k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance specified as 15k ohms was 147k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 1325k ohms at the top of the audiobandIncluding the series impedance of 6 of spacedpair loudspeaker cable the A358s output impedance in normal mode was a very low 0078 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 0092 ohm at 20kHz Bridged mode increased these impedances only slightly The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was minimal at ±01dB   The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   taken without the Audio Precision lowpass filter was flat almost to 20kHz with then a rolloff of 1dB at 30kHz Unusually the ultrasonic rolloff was disturbed by resonant peaks at 60kHz and 100kHz The Primares reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   taken with the Audio Precision lowpass filter so that the waveform was not obscured by ultrasonic noise was clean without any ringing on the tops and bottom and with minimal overshootFig1 Primare A358 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load   8 ohms   4 ohms   2 ohms    Fig2 Primare A358 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsSeparation between adjacent channels was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz reducing to a still good 76dB at the top of the audioband Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and with the auxiliary lowpass filter in circuit the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was a good 74dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to a superb 96dB when I restricted the measurement bandwidth to the audioband and to 986dB when the reading was Aweighted Lowlevel spuriae at the 60Hz power supply frequency and its harmonics were absent from the Primares lowfrequency noisefloor  Fig3 Primare A358 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms  Primare specifies the A358s maximum power as 150W into 8 ohms and 300W into 4 ohms both equivalent to 2176dBW Using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the Primare exceeded its specified power with two channels driven into 8 ohms clipping at 200Wpc   With two channels driven into 4 ohms the A358 clipped at the specified 300Wpc   Again with two channels operating but in bridged mode the Primare clipped at 730W into 8 ohms   just below the specified 740W into this load In bridged mode into 4 ohms the clipping power was 1kW   compared with the specified 750WFig4 Primare A358 distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Primare A358 distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Primare A358 bridged mode distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency in normal mode at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN was very low in the midrange into 8 4 and 2 ohms   but rose in the top octave Peculiarly with each channel driven separately the THDN was lower in the midrange and below into 2 ohms   than it was into 4 ohms  Fig7 Primare A358 THDN   vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms   4 ohms   2 ohms  The A358s distortion at 50W into 8 ohms was very low and predominantly the third harmonic   though bursts of HF noise coincide with the waveform peaks even with the Audio Precision auxiliary filter in circuit The third harmonic lay at a very low –108dB   in channel 8   –103dB   in channel 6   with the second harmonic close to 10dB lower in level in both channels In bridged mode at the same power into 8 ohms   the third harmonic lay at the same –103dB but the second and fifth harmonics were about 10dB higher in level than they had been in normal mode With an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms   while highorder intermodulation products lay at or below –94dB   the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay below –110dB   This spectrum was taken in normal mode The intermodulation distortion was similar in bridged modeFig8 Primare A358 channel 8 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00049 THDN   distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  Fig9 Primare A358 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms  Fig10 Primare A358 bridged mode spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms  Fig11 Primare A358 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  The Primare A358 offers high power especially in bridged mode with very low levels of distortion and audioband noise           '"

       "'  Primare A352     As the A352 has a classD output stage I didnt perform my usual preconditioning by operating the amplifier at onethird the specified power into 8 ohms for an hour With a classAB output stage onethird power results in the maximum dissipation in the output devices but this is not relevant with a classD design However because classD amplifiers emit relatively high levels of ultrasonic noise that would drive my analyzers input into slewrate limiting all   with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which eliminates noise above 200kHz Without the filter there was 433mV of ultrasonic noise present at the loudspeaker terminalsThe Primares voltage gain into 8 ohms measured 258dB from the singleended inputs and unusually 198dB from the balanced inputs   The amplifier preserved absolute polarity   with both balanced and unbalanced input signals The balanced input impedance was 13k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance was 147k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 135k ohms at the top of the audiobandThe A352s output impedance was a very low 0067 ohm at all audio frequencies   The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was therefore minuscule at ±01dB   The response into an 8 ohm resistive load   was flat to 20kHz with then a steep rolloff The Primares reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave   featured a single damped cycle of ringing this presumably due to the output stages integral lowpass filterFig1 Primare A352 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load   8 ohms   4 ohms   2 ohms    Fig2 Primare A352 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsChannel separation was excellent at 90dB in both directions below 2kHz reducing to a stillgood 72dB at the top of the audioband Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and with the auxiliary lowpass filter incircuit the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was 526dB ref 1W into 8 ohms in both channels This ratio improved to 733dB when I restricted the measurement bandwidth to the audioband and to 76dB when the reading was Aweighted Lowlevel spuriae at the 60Hz powersupply frequency and its odd harmonics were vanishingly low in level in the Primares lowfrequency noise floor   However a pair of spurious tones of unknown origin were present around 500Hz these low in level but a little higher in the right channel   than the left  Fig3 Primare A352 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms  Primare specifies the A352 as delivering 200W into 8 ohms and 400W into 4 ohms Both powers are equivalent to 23dBW which implies that the Primare amplifier behaves as a perfect voltage source Using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the Primare exceeded its specified powers With both channels driven with a 1kHz signal it clipped at 225Wpc into 8 ohms   and at 460Wpc into 4 ohms  Fig4 Primare A352 distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsThe distortion at low powers in  s4 and 5 was below the level of the noise floor so I examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN was very low in the midrange into 8 4 and 2 ohms   but rose at higher frequencies The Primare amplifiers distortion at 50W into 8 ohms was predominantly the subjectively innocuous second and third harmonics   these each lying at just –100dB   The second harmonic increased slightly at the same voltage into 4 ohms but was joined by the fifth and seventh harmonics   When the amplifier drove an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms   the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay below –100dB   and higherorder intermodulation products were not much higher in levelFig5 Primare A352 distortion   vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Primare A352 THDN   vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms   4 ohms   2 ohms  Fig7 Primare A352 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00025 THDN   distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out  Fig8 Primare A352 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 50W into 8 ohms  Fig9 Primare A352 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at 100W into 4 ohms  Fig10 Primare A352 HF intermodulation spectrum DC–30kHz 1920kHz at 100W peak into 4 ohms  The Primare A352 offers respectable measured performance with superb matching between the channels           '"
