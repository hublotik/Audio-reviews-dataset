      " Topping LA90 Discrete balanced stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $799.The case is the same as the IC-based Topping LA90 which is fine with me given its high quality look and feel.  The power switch doubles as input selector once the unit is on.  Volume control can be bypassed using switch in the back:As before, power is provided by a hefty, 64 volt switching power supply rated at 4 amps (likely provides higher current in short bursts).  The amplifier as you see is all balanced with three inputs.  You have a selection of low and high gains (although the latter should really be called medium gain).  It can be bridged and nicely tolerates even 4 ohm loads in that mode.  Trigger is provided to enable one power switch to turn on a series of devices.Note that this is a traditional amplifier and not class D.  There is no remote so if you need that, you have to use a DAC/pre-amp with that capability.Topping LA90 Discrete MeasurementsThere is a lot to measure here given the fact that we have dual gains and bridge mode.  Let's work our way through it starting with low gain in stereo mode:Incredibly, the LA90 Discrete matches the performance of its IC based unit, landing on its perch on top of all other amplifiers ever tested:Switching to high gain costs you a few dBs but you are still ahead the competition:So feel free to use this mode.  Noise performance continues to be superb:Frequency response is flat of course and load independent:Crosstalk is better than average amplifier but is a step down from the regular LA90:Multitone showcases the superbly low distortion levels:Let's see how we are doing in power department starting with 4 ohms:We wind up good bit more power at 70 watts (vs 56 watts for normal LA90) while giving up nothing in spectacular noise and distortion department.  Allowing for more distortion gets us more power:8 Ohm performance follows the same path:Tests so far have been at 1 kHz (other than multitone) so let's vary that and see what happens:In a word, wow!  The amplifier simply doesn't care what frequency you throw out it!  This is a quite a step ahead of normal LA90 which itself was state of the art.Power on is silent but off may create a faint noise depending on your speaker sensitivity:Warm up showed one channel struggling a bit but later I found the power connector not fully tight so maybe that was the cause:Regardless, it behaved correctly after a minute.Topping LA90 Discrete Bridged MeasurementsAs with normal LA90, bridge mode still provides superb performance:The name of the game is power though so let's see what we get into 4 ohm:Notice how we get more power but distortion is nowhere to be found until we clip.Wow!  This makes a great case for using a pair of these amps.  You get so much power out of each one, rivalling much larger amplifiers.Reactive Load TestingThe LA90 has a very sharp clipping point.  This means that it goes from vanishingly low distortion to full clipping.  Combine this with aggressive protection circuit which shuts the unit off and you have the make up of a system that can't be measured in batch mode as my Powercube setup uses.  If I set the voltage for 8 ohm load, then it causes the amp to shut down when driven at 4 ohm.  Good news is that the amplifier doesn't care about reactive loads.  Here are the results for 8 ohm for example:Code:Maximum Output4/11/202312:13 AMMaximum Output Level ResultsSelected Load    Ch1 (Vrms)    Ch2 (Vrms)    8 Ohm; 60 deg Capacitive    21.2    21.3    8 Ohm; 30 deg Capacitive    21.1    21.2    8 Ohm; 0 deg Resistive    21.0    21.0    8 Ohm; 30 deg Inductive    20.2    20.3    8 Ohm; 60 deg Inductive    20.9    21.0I could not get a similar output at 4 ohm due to limitation of the instrumentation as stated above.  But if I drove the parameters manually, I could get it to tolerate reactive loads just as well.Selecting 2 ohm caused the protection circuit to kick in.  I didn't have time to mess with that.I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get this test done with the amplifier being pushed to clipping and shut down probably 50 to 100 times.  Even though the case got pretty warm, the amp continued to function without complaining. ConclusionsTraditionally in high-end audio when a company says they are using discrete designs, I get prepared for bad performance.  Topping once again proves that this is no barrier for their designers.  The discreate LA90 not only matches the exemplary performance of the IC based LA90, but betters it in power handling, producing more power (a needed feature).  Pushing noise and distortion down in our top tier performance is very hard but Topping has no problem maintaining its significant lead over even best of the best amplifiers.  Their skills and execution in this regard leaves me speechless.Needless to say, it is my absolute pleasure to add Topping LA90 Discrete to my recommended list.  Today is a happy day!  P.S.  Power amplifiers are least reliable audio products (due to high currents and voltages involved).  New designs sometimes need to prove themselves in this regard.  So if you are risk averse, please don't be the first to purchase this amplifier.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Topping LA90 integrated amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $800.I must say, this is one interesting industrial design. Everything oozes style despite the diminutive package.  This aspect continues in the operation of the unit with the sound of the relays solidly clicking indicating something good is going to happen.  Here is the side view:While quite solid, you can pick it up with one hand.  The small size is aided by a massive external switching power supply:Here are its ratings:Back to the unit, you can see three balanced inputs.  Volume control can be bypassed although I did not do so for my testing. You can also operate LA90 in bridged mono mode.  There is also 12 volt trigger.There are to gain settings.  One at 10 dB and another at 20 dB (nominal).Topping LA90 MeasurementsThese are non-bridged mode measurements.  Bridged setup follows this section.  Let's start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm in low gain mode:I don't need to tell you that this is a stunning level of achievement.  We have a power amplifier producing almost the same SINAD as a state of the art DAC!  Using this number, LA90 grabs the top spot with ease with a nice gap to boot:Here it is zoomed:You might be thinking that it can only do so with low gain but that is not true.  Even in high gain performance is spectacular:It would still achieve top spot in our rankings and achieve full audible transparency.Not only is distortion vanishingly low, so is noise level:Frequency response is flat and wide as expected:Being class AB design, it has no load dependency.Crosstalk is incredibly good although it loses a tiny bit relative to last champ of amplifiers:Multitone test shows the very low distortion levels:Let's see how much power we have:So power is modest in non-bridged mode.  But note how good the high gain mode is so I would feel just fine using that for operation of the unit if you need to.  Allowing distortion to rise to 1% naturally gets us more power:Here is 8 ohm:Oops.  \"High Power\" should be \"High Gain.\"Changing frequencies shows the same excellent performance:Despite being pushed deep into clipping, the amplifier did not complain until I got to 20 Hz where its over temperature shut it down.Finally, you don't need any warm up:Topping LA90 Bridged Mode PerformanceA shorting wire is provided to connect the two negative speaker bindings together allowing bridged mode from the top two posts.  Here is our dashboard again:Performance is still exceptional.  Here is our SNR:Due to more power available now, we cross the amazing 140 dB SNR threshold.  What this says is that even if you play at 140 dB, the noise level will be at or below threshold of hearing!  Of course there is not enough power there to do that but basically you know that noise is not part of the equation with LA90 as even 5 watt measurement hits below threshold of hearing.We want to know the power increase though so here it is (with 8 ohm which is the minimum impedance):Now we get good bit of power at 95 watts with almost no penalty relative to non-bridged mode.  Notice the massive gap as far as noise floor relative to Purifi amplifier.Allowing for 1% distortion we get:Here is the super wideband spectrum of the amplifier while producing 5 watts:Edit:Power Tests at 2 Ohm (Stereo) and 4 Ohm (Bridged)Requests were made to test the amplifier beyond its minimum load impedance specs.  Let's start with 2 ohm load while driving one channel in stereo mode.  Dashboard still shows superb performance:Let's now sweep the power:You don't get extra power relative to 4 ohm but the amplifier was stable and did not even go into protection. Now let's switch to Bridged mode (both amplifiers driven in differential mono) and run our power sweep again:Now we see the amplifier \"doubling down\" producing nearly 200 watts into 4 ohm.  Again, the amplifier was well composed and kept driving into clipping region without complaining, or shutting down.Again, the above tests are beyond the amplifier specifications and tests I never run as such.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping engineers are bringing their expertise in designing ultra low noise and distortion in headphone amplification to power amplifiers.  As such, they have outdone every amplifier I have measured in that regard, getting ahead to capture the #1 position with a large gap to #2 choice.The amplifier is not for everyone though. Power level is modest as compared to competitors.  And you have that large external power supply.  My wish is another version of this amp with built-in power supply, motorized volume control with bridge mode standard.  For now, we need to celebrate one of the most important development in delivering transparent, high fidelity amplification to audiophiles in a very attractive package.It is my absolute pleasure to recommend the Topping LA90.  History is made on this day folks!-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Hypex NCx500 NCOREx reference design amplifier. It was sent by the company and kindly assembled by our local expert, @Rick Sykora.As you see the sample is a \"monoblock\" configuration (one channel) driven by Hypex SMPS1200 switching power supply.  The only other board is the Ncore standard interface board.   The gain as set is almost 12 dB.  EDIT: see follow up below review for with buffer (27 dB gain) performance.Here is a close up:Note that this board includes a pre-amp (buffer).  I am testing per above in unbuffered mode.During use the amplifier as a whole was extremely stable and never changed its temperature, nor did it go into protection mode.  A sole XLR connection is the input to the unit.  All fits in this nice compact box.Hypex NCx500 Buffer Bypass Amplifier MeasurementsI let the unit warm up for a while but was not needed as it was stable as soon as powered up:It did reach a plateau around 11 minutes though as you see.  But note that the vertical scale is 0.1 dB.Now on to our dashboard of 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Distortion is provably inaudible at -120 dB.  A bit of noise sags that down to 113 dB which is still superb performance, landing it at #2 best amplifier every tested:Noise performance is exceptional:Even when listening to 16 bit content at 5 watts, you have an extra 10 dB of noise margin!  This is one quiet amplifier.Frequency response is wide and load invariant which is a great attribute not existing in all class D designs:Multitone test shows off its low distortion yet again:I must say, I was not prepared for the amp to beat the reference Benchmark AHB2 in noise level in our power test:EDIT: I re-ran the power sweeps again with tighter load terminals which resulted in much lower distortion levels especially at 4 ohm:Despite massive amount of power the NCx500 produces, its distortion is now close to the best we have ever measured!I updated these max and peak measurements again which produced more power:Company specs this power level even at 2 ohm so I tested that:This is one powerful amplifier!Here is our updated 8 ohm power:I was surprised how much lower its noise level is compared to Purifi 1ET400A reference design.  Maybe that amp was not running at such a low gain setting though (edit: correct).  Still, this is once again superb performance.Sweeping with different frequencies we see various distortion mechanisms kicking in (edit: now updated showing much less distortion):There is some rise in distortion with frequency but this is to be expected.Finally, here is the pop on and off noises.  Keep in mind that this is a reference design and the on/off switch turns the whole unit on and on as opposed to soft power:Hypex NCx500 Buffered MeasurementsAs noted, there is integrated buffer (pre-amp) in this module.  I activated it which boosted the gain to 27 dB.  Maximum power is now achieved at around 2.2 volts which is well within the output of many well designed DACs using balanced out.  Here is our new dashboard:Distortion has gone down a bit but we have picked up a bit of power supply noise.  Despite that hit, performance is still state of the art:As noted, SNR has gone down but still excellent:Multitone is mostly the same but impacted by the power supply noise:Frequency response is the same:As noted distortion is lower:On/Off noise is impacted a bit:ConclusionsHypex amplifiers have always enjoyed great performance in our testing.  It is wonderful to see the company innovating and increasing the performance of their high power NC500 platform.  You no longer have to compromise between available power and superb technical performance.  You can have both.It is my pleasure to recommend the Hypex NCx500 OEM amplifier module.  Cant' wait to see it show up in commercial designs.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Hypex Nilai500DIY class D amplifier module with PS500DIY power supply. Parts were provided by the company and member @Rick Sykora was kind enough to assemble it:As indicated, the single channel amplifier is on the left and the power supply on the right. The amplifier has built-in preamp providing three levels of gain (12, 22 and 28 dB). A jumper selects the appropriate level.  At 12 dB, you need about 12 volts to reach full power which requires a pro audio interface or a pre-amp with that level of output.  The sole input in this configuration is balanced.In use the amplifier was exceptionally solid even when pushed hard.  It kept going and stayed very cool.  It is rated to 2 ohm (see measurements below).Edit: in the original review I had the top open so I could change the gain settings.  Alas, it turns out that doing so allowed some noise pick up around 10 kHz.  I re-tested with the lid closed and that issue went away.  As a results, we have slightly better performance especially in high-gain.Hypex Nilai500DIY MeasurementsLet's start with lowest gain setting:That is superb performance with distortion at or below -140 dB!  Here is the response at higher grain settings:With all thee gain settings, the amp lands in our top 20 best amplifiers ever reviewed based on combined noise and distortion rating (SINAD):Noise performance is excellent but just shy of state of the art:But gets there at full power:As we expect from Hypex, frequency response is load impedance independent:Multitone performance is excellent:Amplifier is stable on power up:Let's look at available power at 4 ohm:Looks like we no longer have to decided between superbly low noise and distortion and available power!  State of the art performance is once again achieved in low gain while still producing lots of power (342 watts).  Allowing distortion to climb to 1% naturally gives us more power (and matches company spec):We still have healthy power even with 8 ohm load:Since the amp is rated at 2 ohm, I measured that as well:There is a bit of penalty but still great performance.  Seems power supply is limiting power so you don't get more juice.I was a bit surprised at the ballooning of the distortion at higher frequencies:EDIT:There is more of a noticeable pop on power off than power on:As requested, here is the switching response:ConclusionsIt is clear Hypex is taking competition in class D amplifiers seriously responding with a DIY friend amplifier solution that has a ton of power and wonderful performance.  While we could nitpick here and there, but in the larger context of the amplifiers out there, this is a superb offering of great performance and lots and lots of power.FYI I don't have pricing for the kit.  If someone has it, please post.  I see online ads saying around $900 to $1,100 for a single channel.I am happy to add Hypex Nilai500DIY amplifier and its companion PS500DIY power supply to my recommended list.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Benchmark AHB2 Amplifier using THX technology to reduce distortion.  I was going to request one for testing due to membership demand but to my pleasant surprise, the company volunteered to contact me and send not one, but two units!  I requested the second one because of something  I was seeing in the measurements that turned out to be my issue, not the amp's.  The AHB2 retails for US $2,999 from the company direct.The AHB2 is a very compact form factor, enabled by use of switching power supply to increase efficiency/density:There is just a power switch in the front.  It might be but I constantly reached for the screw next to it to power it on!  Having the power switch be slightly different color or shape may help with this.There are a set of LEDs that show the status of the amplifier.  They are driven by an FPGA (field programmable digital logic) that monitors all aspects of the amplifier and shuts down the unit if stressed.  It did so very quickly and efficiently in my testing.  Usually this is done with purely analog or maybe a small microprocessor.  As such, the coverage of scenarios that could damage the amplifier is much less complete than using the approach Benchmark is using in AHB2.Here is the back panel:This is a very minimalistic approach given the small amount of real estate available.  Only input is XLR balanced which is just fine in my book.  A gain switch allows the input level to be controlled so that you can just use an RCA to XLR adapter and still get full power (2 volt max in high gain).  At the other extreme, the low gain setting is designed for professional pre-amps with lots of output, getting its max power at 9.8 volts.  Using this scheme, the signal to noise ratio can be improved as you will see in measurements later.For speaker terminals there are two sets: classic heavy duty banana jacks and SpeakOn.  The SpeakOn are locking and provide the best performance.  I lost about 3 dB of performance using the banana jacks due to less secure connect there.  So the measurements you see are with SpeakOn jacks.Another minor nit on that note: I had a rather cheap SpeakOn cable and its plug was just large enough to hit the silver screws that the sockets are mounted with.  Typical round shaped SpeakOn ones are not an issue.  Flush mount screws would solve this problem.There is a switch for selecting stereo or mono bridged output.  The latter quadruples the amount of power available and unlike typical bridging, according to Benchmark comes at no penalty in distortion!  I plan to test this later as it has a minimum impedance of 6 ohm so I could not use the 4 ohm setup I used for this testing.There is a very beefy AC mains cable with really nice locking tabs.  Insert it and it stays put unless you push the two red tabs on each side.  Nothing is more aggravating than the AC cable coming half-way lose from the IEC socket.Being a proper company of course the AHB2 comes with full set of regulatory/safety/emissions certifications which is super important with power amplifiers given the high voltages and currents running around in them.In use the AHB2 stays very cool for a power amplifier when it is idling, outputting little power which was a nice surprise.As to THX technology, it merges a low-power but very low distortion amplifier with a high power but higher distortion amplifier.  The distortion of the latter is not seen because it is producing so much power (so the ratio of distortion is lower).  The general scheme is not new, dating back to 1980s but new implementation is.  We have seen this in stellar performance of Massdrop THX AAA 789 amplifier which broke new ground in level of distortion and noise. Will the Benchmark AHB2 manage the same?  Let's see.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my 5 watt output test using 4 ohm load using SpeakOn terminals as noted:I hope your jaw is on the floor just like mine was when I saw this picture emerge!    113 dB THD+N in a power amplifier?  Are you kidding me?Look at the harmonic distortion.  The worst case spike is below -130 dB!  This is insanely good.  Of course this type of SINAD (signal and noise ratio) crowns the Benchmark AHB2 as the best I have ever tested:The performance was so good I literally had to rebuild my dummy load to get there.  Even the quality of the metal used in the connectors matters to get to this level of distortion.  I replace all my dummy loads with higher precision ones that have much less VCR (voltage coefficient of resistance).  Resistor values can become voltage dependent creating distortions of their own.  Up to about 105 dB of THD+N, it doesn't matter but beyond that, the VCR was the dominant distortion, not the Benchmark AHB2 amplifier!It was requested that I show the breakdown and distortion so here we are:Our best case hearing threshold is -116 dB SPL so no question that this level of distortion is totally inaudible.  Separating the noise from THD, we see that it is noise that we are measuring as THD+N, rather than distortion:And this is with exceptional noise performance of Benchmark AHB2 as we see in the graph of THD+N versus power:Even in high gain, the AHB2 easily outperforms the DIY Hypex NC400 I had tested before which used to be the best amp I had tested.We have 185 watts of power at incredibly low distortion of 0.00016%, besting the company specifications.Note that the FPGA protection mode kicks in and essentially shots the amplifier down past the limit.  You get absolutely distortion-less and noiseless performance until there is no more.EDIT: here is performance in bridged mode using same 4 ohm load:You get 500 watts of stunningly clean power.  Protection circuit shut the unit down after that so it is quite safe to try.  With a THD essentially matching the non-bridged mode, there is no reason to be afraid of trying this.Intermodulation distortion versus power level shows the same story of clean power:If you want to know what you get for extra money over bargain amplifiers, you can see the difference in the above graph.  We are not talking about 5 to 10 dB but whopping 40 dB better!I have had requests for intermodulation distortion using dual 19 and 20 kHz tones.  Here is that:THD+N versus output level looks far cleaner than anything I have tested before:Even at the limit of our hearing (20 kHz), we have vanishingly low amount of distortion.  The graph is exaggerated so shows a rise there but in absolute levels, despite 90 kHz bandwidth of the test, we have incredibly low THD+N of just .004%.The sharp spike at 45 Hz in green shows the amplifier going into protection mode.  So don't pump that sine wave continuously into it at 133 watts.  Frequency response is exceptional too as expected:Since this is not a switching amplifier, there is no filter there allowing the bandwidth to go to 200 kHz and beyond.  Lowest band of AM radio is 450 kHz so likely you could use the AHB2 for an AM radio transmitter!  Usually when we test switching amplifiers we see all kind of \"interesting\" things in their outputs above hearing range.  The AHB2 is a classic configuration albeit, with a switching power supply so all is well and clean here:My reference graph for the Hypex NC400 used an AES filter (by accident) so I ran the AHB2 both ways, with or without that filter.  Using the filter (in green) so the two are equal, we see much cleaner spectrum below 200 kHz and of course, no massive switching spikes.  Worst case spike is below -115 dB.  In other words, the Benchmark AHB2 is clean even in the areas you are not looking!  It is like a restaurant scrubbing their parking lot with soap and pad as well as their dishes.  My loose wires on dummy loads is not the best setup for measuring crosstalk but here it is anyway:Where our hearing is most sensitive (2 to 5 kHz), separation is around 100 dB which is way, way more than we need.  Despite the small enclosure, the AHB2 manages exceptional numbers here.EDIT: forgot to run the classic SNR test in the original review:Wow, assuming you play at peak of 120 dBSPL, your noise floor will be at -10 dBSPL!  That is absolute silence.ConclusionsIt goes without saying that the Benchmark AHB2 breaks new ground with respect to performance of power amplifiers.  Using it, you can be assured that any distortion that you hear is from other sources (speaker, source, content, etc.).  This is what I look for in high-end audio: absolutely the best performance so no second guessing is involved. You buy once, and you are happy forever!All of this comes from a company that is a model of transparency with proper and accurate measurements of their products on their site.  And importantly, volunteering to have that data shown to be correct by independent sources such as us.  Support form the company for me at least has also been exceptional.Yes, $3,000 is fair bit of money but is pocket change in high-end audio.  Sales tax is higher than $3,000 for most of those products!  I hear a lot of talk from audiophiles to have the equipment get out of the way of enjoying the music.  Well the Benchmark AHB2 at levels that assuredly passes full transparency.  So if that is your moto, you better stop buying boutique products with no specs and independent measurements and get an AHB2.  Everything you hear then will be what is in your source, not the dirty dishes that your amp my serve your food on.Needless to say, the Benchmark AHB2 gets my strongest recommendation for power amplifier.  The pink panther agrees, having hit the ball out of the park after I took that shot!------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The comedian Chris Rock said it best: there is a difference between being rich and wealthy.

      " Audiophonics HPA-S400ET. It was sent to me by the company after member request and costs 1 490,00 € (US $1,638).I must say this is one of the best packaging of class D amplifiers (Purifi in this case) that I have seen!  It is slick and has style.  While the heatsink on one side is cosmetic, the other is connected to the power supply power transistors although in use nothing rose above room temperature.  Back panel shows extremely high quality speaker connections:You can see it better with the lid open:I must say, this is so clean you can eat of of it!    I simply cannot find any fault with the assembly and design.  Bottom to modules are Purifi 1ET400A modules fed by their own custom buffer/pre-amp gain stage.  Jumpers let you select from different settings (see measurement section).Audiophonics HPA-S400ET MeasurementsGiven the three different gain stages, it was a challenge to decide what to test so that this job doesn't become nearly infinite in scope.  I will first show you the dashboard for all three gains starting from high gain:This is superb performance already with distortion products at -125 dB.  Channel matching is excellent.  Here is medium gain petformance:This is a nice setting as max power is achieved at 4 volts meaning you can use all of our modern/desktop amps to drive the unit and gain a bit of performance.If you have a pro interface that goes up to 10 volts out, you can utilize the low gain mode:This gain is actually close to how I measured our two top performers (Benchmark AHB2 and Topping PA5) so let's see how the Audiophonics ranks:Looking at top 20 we see:Amazing performance!  Measuring SNR at low and medium gain we get:OK, from here on I am going to stick with low gain mode.  Here is our multitone:Stellar as expected.  Crosstalk manages to actually land in #1 position of any amplifier tested:Frequency response is dead flat with no load dependency:Let's sweep and see how we do with 4 ohm load:Excellent performance.  Here is how much power we get if we allow more distortion:Switching to 8 ohm we see that the performance actually exceeds than of Purifi (although I think that was tested at higher gain):Testing at other frequencies we still have great performance:Finally, the amplifier is stable at power up so no need to wait for it to warm up:ConclusionsThe Audiophonics HPA-S400ET comes in a beautiful package with super performance to match its good looks. Yes, it builds on Purifi's excellent platform but they managed to add value without messing with its performance.  The gain settings are well thought through.  The whole thing is so well executed and must be a delight to our European members who can buy it locally.  Having been built in France, it is also a feather in the cap of our French members.  I am happy to give my strongest recommendation to Audiophonics HPA-S400ET.  You have a lot of power with superb fidelity and transparency.Edit: video review just posted:-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " TP (Topping) RA3 stereo balanced rackmount amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $229.Yes, this is a new sub-brand from Topping.  I quite like it.  The large and highly visible volume level is as gorgeous to look at as it is responsive.  A remote control is provided which is something you don't usually get.  The remote (or front panel) allow you to select between RCA and XLR input:For those of us who have a DAC and an analog source, this is all that we need.Lots of nice touches are there such as independent memory for the volume setting for RCA vs XLR.  Safe volume settings.  Trigger support and ability to update firmware in the future.  Love that despite low cost, the power supply is built in.  You have a hard power switch which puts the unit in standby.  Push the volume knob or the remote button and it powers on.This line of products, at least for now, will be sold by Topping direct.  Alas, it is not yet on the website so you may have to wait a bit to order it.I don't know anything about the design but based on measurements below, it seems to be a highly optimized class D chip architecture.TP RA3 Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Distortion is kept below threshold of audibility at around -116 dB.  So noise is the only thing we need to worry about.  There, when combined with distortion, nicely lands RA3 in our top 20 best amplifiers ever tested:Mind you, noise performance is excellent:Survey of available music indicates best case dynamic range of 18 bits and TP RA3 gives you that at just 5 watts!  Allow it to go to its max power and it reaches 20 bits.Multitone showcases the very low distortion in mid frequencies where our hearing is most sensitive:But if you insist on pumping ear deafening high frequency tones into it in the form of 19 and 20 kHz tones, you naturally get more distortion:A concern with low cost class D amp ICs is load (speaker) dependency.  Topping has worked hard to make that basically a non-issue:Crosstalk is incredibly good, besting even our reference:Let's measure power into 4 ohm:As noted, measurements completely match Topping spec of 130 watts at 1% THD+N.  Not boundless power but very good for many.  Naturally we lose good bit of power if you have a rare 8 ohm speaker:Varying the frequency we do see the class D chip amp create more distortion above 5 kHz or so:There is a bit of a noise spike with power off:There is some inconsequential spikes in one channel in the first short minutes as the amplifier warms up:Speaking of that, the amplifier didn't feel to be rising above room temperature in my testing -- on top anyway.Finally, here is the efficiency vs output power (per channel -- both channels driven):Idle power while on is about 9 watts. The protection circuit is aggressive in the way it shuts the unit down when pushed hard so I did not try to run my reactive load tests.ConclusionsIt is remarkable to me how Topping is not only capable of producing new product one after the other, they do so while striving for state of the art in performance.  This is so even though they are bound by the capabilities of the class D chip amplifier they are using.  I really like the larger form factor as it not only allows better dissipation of heat and inclusion of AC power supply, but also makes the unit more substantial and \"professional looking.\"  If they made the rack ears optional, they would fit nicely in a home system as well.Feature set is great for this class of product with inclusion of remote control, trigger support, nice and visible volume level, etc.It is my pleasure to add TP RA3 to my recommended list.  Incredible performance for so little money. -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp with the optional Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage.  With that option, the cost is £1,979.00 excluding VAT.  This translates into US $2,554.  The unit was purchased new and drop shipped to me by a kind member.  I had previously measured the reference design from Purifi so will be good to see how this version rates with a different input stage.The Nord dual monoblock comes in a very attractive enclosure (most of which is not visible in this image):Efficiency of class D amplifiers and switchmode power supply enables such slim case to be used.  There are two rows of heatsinks on the sides but they are decorative for the most part.  I will do a teardown separately.  For now, the amplifiers dissipate heat into the bottom of the chassis and dual power supplies have their own heatsinks inside the box.The back panel shows seriously beefy and nice feeling speaker connectors:When I received the unit, it immediately shut down.  The reason was a blown fuse.  I replaced it with a spare that comes in the IEC holder.  That worked for all but my last test which is the strenuous power vs frequency.  I have let Colin know that I think the fuse amperage needs to be increased given our low operating voltage in US.  Note that with music you are not going to hit this easily so it is more of an issue of lab/stress testing.  I don't have a higher amp fuse to try with it until a batch arrives on Monday.  The fuse is the smaller 5x25mm which I only have a few of in low amperage (usually are used in multimeters and such).Edit: turns out the fuse that was sent for was for 240 volt countries.  A \"slo-blow\" 10 amp replacement fuse was sent and worked fine.Other than this, the amplifier was solid in its performance never shutting down or complaining.  The enclosure didn't even get warmer than room temperature.  Inclusion of two power supplies here relieves my worry of a the power supply being the weak link, not the amplifier.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 Ohm at 1 kHz:This is right on the money as far as THD+N and hence SINAD:Which is great news of course.Noise performance also matched the Purifi reference design:We have a very low distortion and very low noise floor.  This is all that you would want to ask an amplifier.  That, and power so let's see how it does there:Dual power supplies don't give you more power as we are essentially matching the reference design with one power supply.I was surprised to see a rise in distortion with one channel worse than the other.  Is this the Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage in play or were we given better evaluation samples at announcement?  We won't know until we test another amp that uses Purifi gain stage.Same issue exists at 8 ohm although not as exaggerated:This makes me think the issue may be in the amplifier.Note that this is not an audible concern so don't jump off the cliff please.  We see an exaggerated version of the same in intermodulation distortion relative to input level:Frequency response is flat and similar to reference design:Sweeps of power versus frequency gives us varying curves (ideal = all curves on top of each other):We see that at 20 Hz where we need most power, we have least amount of it.  This is typical of amplifiers since 20 Hz tone changes slowly not giving a chance for power supply capacitors to recharge between cycles.Finally here is the 19+20 kHz at the same 5 watt power of Purifi reference design:The pair around the main tone are identical to reference design.  Noise floor is a hair higher but that is probably run to run variation.ConclusionsThe Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp is an attractive build of the Purifi class D amplifier technology.  The dual mono configuration raises the price fair but but my belief is that it will last a lot longer than the single power supply version.  Measured performance is just a bit worse than Purifi reference design as power increases beyond 25 watts or so.  Not an audible difference but would be good to figure out where this is coming from.  I can't detect any improvement from Sonic Imagery discrete 990enh opamps.  So personally I would go with the stock gain stage and save enough money for a night out alone.I am happy to recommend the Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amplifier.  It builds on state-of-the-art Purifi amplifier modules and delivers it in nice packaging.--------As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.The Pink Panthers are making up their Christmas list and I can tell you it is going to be a long, long list.

      " Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  With the options as tested, the cost is US $4,212.  As the name indicates, the amp is based on Hypex NC1200 class D amplifiers plus some value add in the form of Sonic Imagery 990Enh buffers, very fancy speaker terminals and even directional fuse from Synergistic Research!The enclosure is the same elegant design I have tested before with Purifi modules:And here is the back panel connectivity:The massive speaker terminals had no trouble handling my heavy speaker wires.The trigger input is unusual in that it is supposed to fully shut of the unit, consuming no power (?).  The amps are mounted to the bottom of the case as is typically down.  So the top got slightly warm in testing.  The bottom though was rather toasty after stress testing.  I will post a teardown later.In use, the NC1200DM never complained, shut down, or go into protection.  Even during my intensive power versus frequency that causes weaker designs to bail out, the NC1200DM cruised right on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard at 5 watts into 4 Ohms:Channel matching is quite good.Highest distortion is third harmonic at around -108 dB which mostly responsible for 105 dB of SINAD (signal relative to sum of distortions and noise).  This puts the NC1200DM near the top of our rankings:Signal to noise ratio was quite good especially near max power:32-tone signal resembling \"music\" shows exceptionally low intermodulation distortion in audible band:Most meaningful test is power versus distortion and noise so let's get into that with 4 ohm load:We clock nearly 500 watts before the clipping onset.  Hypex rates the module at 700 watts which is likely at higher distortion levels (see later).  Distortion rises fairly early relative to our reference.I was surprised to once again see how quiet the NC1200DM was when testing at 8 ohms and comparing to Purifi 1ET400A reference design:Power output leaves 1ET400A behind at 270+ watts.  The cost is higher distortion.Keeping THD+N at 0.1% and sweeping the frequency we get:Now we peak at 600 watts.  Drop at low frequencies where we need power is slight (10% or so).  The sudden drop at 20 kHz is usually due to ultrasonic noise shaping and wide bandwidth of this test (90 kHz).  In real use, we don't need much power at 20 kHz and at any rate, a lot more would be produced than this chart indicates.Here is the intermodulation distortion for 19+20 kHz tones for those of you who love this graph: Remember that the threshold of hearing is quite high at 19 and 20 khz even for people with healthy response up to these levels.  And at any rate, music never has full amplitude signals at these levels.Crosstalk performance was very good, stopping just short of our reference:ConclusionsThe Nord One NC1200M Signature Edition produces tons and tons of clean power with very low noise floor.  While other amps have tested with lower distortion, none come to its power output.  Audiophiles routinely underestimate how much power they need.  As such, it is great to see an amplifier produce so much power while keeping distortion and noise at bay.  I see no performance flaws anywhere.Yes, the \"signature\" components are of dubious value but they are not hurting things either.The enclosure is attractive.  And the whole package light and efficient.  My kind of design. I am happy to give a strong recommendation to the Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amp.--------As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.The panther without the head took my car for a joy ride.

      " VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp (buffer/input gain stage).  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,090.  I just reviewed the same amp but with SIL 994EnH-Ticha Pro buffer so you can compare them. As with the other variation, I am a fan of the more slim rack mount case (it is a lot deeper than this photo shows):Back panel as expected:VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp MeasurementsLet's start with our dashboard and see if the power supply noise we had with the SIL buffer also exists here thereby telling us if the problem was that or something else:Sadly the issue remains with the noise in the FFT spectrum.  So something else is at play.  I tried to mess with grounding to see if it impacts it and it would get much worse.  At one point one channel got unstable producing variable output.  Maybe that was instrumentation error but I did not walk away with a good feeling on this.  Nevertheless, overall ranking remains quite high due to stellar performance of Purifi amplifier module itself:I am just going to post the rest of the measurements without text as they are similar as the other review:When I ran the dashboard and saw the same problems with the other VTV amplifier, I wanted to rule out instrumentation error.  So I dug up my Purifi reference design and it produced superbly clean output as it did in my original review.  While I was at it, I also ran this test (which sadly I over-wrote) and it produced similar output to this VTV amplifier.  So the choice of buffer doesn't have much impact here:ConclusionsWhen I bought my latest car, it came with a fine scratch on the instrumentation cluster cover.  Too lazy to take it back to be repaired.  To this day it bothers me when I see it even though it doesn't impact anything on the operation of the car.  Such is the case with this VTV Purifi amplifiers.  In absolute terms they land way on top of the class.  But looking carefully we see that something in the assembly and layout has caused performance to degrade objectively.  It won't impact you in any way listening to it but just like my car, it shouldn't be there.  Smaller companies building these boxes don't do any measurements and hence can't spot problems like this.  So it is partly understandable but as consumers, we get to be ruthless in our demand in best in class execution.  So I hope the company looks to resolve these problems as their prices are very attractive otherwise.I can't recommend the VTV Purifi amplifiers based on these two versions I have tested.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.

      "The design of the Vera Audio P150/600 RS is complete. The price is 29 600 NOK exclusive tax and shipping. Due to the corona situation and a delay with chassises, it will be a while before we have a decent number in quantity. We only have a few for sales at the moment and that's the reason it hasn't been announced yet. But I thought I would share some details for those who have an interest.In 4 Ohm it delivers 1kW with amazingly low 0.0006% THD+N. This is bridged, but it says a lot about the performance. The \"notches\" you see in the graph below comes from our measuring equipment switching measuring area and isn't able to keep up with such low numbers. The actual distortion around 50-500W is even lower. Probably down towards 0.00025%.In stereo mode it gives out 290W in 4 Ohm with the same low distortion:The linearity is also in it's own class. +/- 0.025dB from 20Hz to 20kHz. -3dB at 60kHz.The noise as low as 17uV (A-weigthing):CMRR.This is something we have spent a lot of resources on. Briefly said, CMRR is the the amplifiers ability to supress noise that comes from the outside through cables. Everything over 100dB is considered expectionally good.Here's the measurement of the gain adjustments. This is also something we have spent a lot of time on to get accurate.You can see that the maximum deviation is 0.01dBThe chassis of the amplifier is cut out from a whole block of aluminium and there are no visible screws or seams. It's of very high quality and part of the reason our amplifier cost what it does besides extremely accurate gain adjustments, bridging option, etc.Some more info from our enigneer Armand:* We use a huge power supply of 3kW. This has plenty more capacity and runs cooler at heavy loads. It will also result in much lower distortion at low frequencies (at high loads)* Our amplifier is (as far as we know) the only Purifi model that has bridging capability. A lot of testing has been done and special considerations are in place to make this work as it should. Looking at the measurements of 1kW with 0,0006% distortion proves this is flawless.* We deliver real measurements of the whole amplifier from input to output measured with a R&S Audio analyzer. \n",

      " NAD M27 7-channel surround audio amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Seems like the M27 came out back in 2014 and costs US $4,400.The M27 has the same design language as the excellent M17 Home Theater Processor (looks only):The enclosure, especially the top surfaces, oozes quality and luxury in the way that many high-end audio companies fail at.  And the looks are actually functional with ample ventilation holes for proper cooling.  I will do a teardown later to show this in more detail.One strange bit of functionality is that the NAD logo lights up orange but goes off when the amplifier is turned on using the touch button on top.  This is backwards but fits the functionality for home theater use in darkened room.The rear panel takes the high quality look of the front and top to the back:Everything from XLR connectors to speaker terminals is stout and feels solid.In use, the amplifier when driven in two channel mode, never came remotely close to complaining, shutting down, etc. which I frequently see in AVRs.Heat dissipation at first is very modest but after half hour of use, the idle power consumption of the rest of the unused channels served to warm up the top.  No worries though as it was not remotely \"hot.\"  This is due to use of switching power supply (single one powering all the channels) and class D amplifiers based on design from Hypex nCore series.  The actual implementation is custom which I will show in teardown.For my testing, I focused on XLR input only.  I hope if you buy an amplifier of this class, that is the connection you use.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard, driving two channels into 4 ohm at 5 watts:Ah, what a relief it is to see excellent SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) in home theater space after testing so many subpar amplifiers in AVRs.  Distortion products are around -110 dB.  Ironically, this is far better than the processor and AVR DACs we have tested.  In 2-channel world, our desktop class are usually way ahead of amplifiers but not in home theater.  So far anyway.The very nice showing in noise and distortion puts the M27 amplifier near top of the class:Spectrum of 1 kHz FFT shows the typical switching frequency in 400+ kHz:Here is the frequency response:There is a kink in there around 50 kHz but seeing how it is way out there as far as audiblity, it should be OK.  May differ though with a real speaker load.Crosstalk is very good:Dynamic range at around rated power is excellent (better than 20 bits in digital terms):Even at rated power you have 105 dB or 17.5 bits.Most important test is THD+N (distortion+noise) relative to power level as we increase input.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Wow, this is one powerful beast in stereo mode.  Courtesy of a power supply that is designed to feed 7 channels, it is not a bottleneck in 2-channel mode allowing these class d modules to sing.  And sing loud!8 Ohm output is also quite good:Of course in neither case we are able to match the state-of-the-art 2-channel amplifiers from likes of Benchmark or Purifi.  But what is there at -90 dB or better should be quite excellent.Peak power as you can imagine, is even higher:Here is a refined version of a recent test: I sweep for power using different frequencies from 20 kHz on down to just 20 Hz.  Test bandwidth is 45 kHz so that it allows enough harmonics to be included in the test but not too much that it just shows ultrasonic noise-shaping and such:As expected, at low frequencies we have lowest distortion (lowest graphs) but we clip due to much larger power demand of these \"slow\" waves.ConclusionsThe NAD M27 surround power amplifier has exceptional looks and build quality.  It is beautiful to look at.  That beauty runs way deep into its veins, producing lots of power in a class-leading way.  Efficiency of class-d power amplifier and switching power supplies serve to keep the unit quite cool for its power rating and number of channels.  Great attention has gone into heat management and signal flow -- something I don't normally see in DIY hypex ncore builds.Yes, at US $4,400 it is not cheap but you are getting 7 channels of amplifications.  That is roughly $630/channel which is actually quite competitive.I am happy to give the NAD M27 one of my highest recommendations.If you have a home theater and want a gorgeous, powerful and performant multi-channel amplifier, your search is over.  Get the M27 and worry about money for food later.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.It has been raining and raining hard.  Starting to get to me.

      "This is a write-up and detailed measurements of the March Audio P122 class D Hypex based stereo power amplifier.  It was sent to me by the company (@March Audio).  The P122 costs US $750. Due to my relationship with company owner, I won't be performing a review or providing a recommendation one way or the other.  So don't look for panthers on pictures either.The P122 uses similar packaging to the rest of March Audio products:There is just a touch button that turns the unit on and off (really on and standby).The back panel has very nice and really long speaker terminals:In use, the P122 never complained or get warm.  It passed all the tests without going into protection mode.Power supply is switching as noted on the unit so works as is worldwide.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:As noted on the THD+N panel, performance is roughly the same as the spec in one channel and slightly better in the other.  Distortion and noise combined is near top of class:Signal to noise ratio is excellent:Crosstalk is respectable as well:Frequency response is good but not flat out to infinity as some amps are:Multitone test shows a few odd spikes in mid frequencies:But levels are nearly 100 dB down so not a cause for concern.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet's start with 4 ohm:We are a bit shy of the specification on power but distortion and noise is much better than typical mass market product.  Same is true of 8 ohm load:Not sure what explains the shortfall in power. These amplifiers have regulated switching power supplies so usually don't produce more power than continuous:ConclusionsWhile the power level is on the low side, the performance is much better than typical brand name amplifiers.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Amazing things you learn.

      " ATI AT522NC Stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 522NC costs US $2,195 but I see it on Amazon for US $1,995.  The AT522NC is part of a series which starts with 2 channels of class D amplification and goes up to 4 channels in the same enclosure.The industrial design of the AT522NC has some unique touches, some of which work, some that don't:The part that detracts is ironically the ATI logo.The power button has a very nice feel and gives one impression of quality.Looking at the back, I was surprised by choice of input power connection:It is a 20 amp IEC connection rather than the most common, 15 amp variety.  This is partially due to use of linear power supply and massive/heavy toroidal transformer.  But the most common reason is that the same setup is used in higher channel count amplification.The amplifier is on a vertically mounted hypex NC-500 class D amplifiers with their own heatsinks.  The \"motherboard\" has the power supply components.  Overall, it seems like a very neat and logical design.The speaker connections are of course very secure and high quality as can be expected in this price range.  Great to see balanced XLR inputs which is how I tested the unit.In use, there was barely a heat rise in the enclosure and the unit never shut down or complain even in the face of severe clipping.   The large feet allow better convection cooling which is appreciated.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone, at 5 watt into a 4 ohm load:The use of linear power supply has its price in the form of power supply spurious tones (60, 18, 300 Hz, etc.).  The dominant distortion peak is third harmonic at a bit less than 100 dB.  Add some noise to it and SINAD (THD+N inverted) becomes around 98 dB.  This places the ATI522NC well above average of all the amplifiers we have tested:It sits just to the level of NC500 from Nord.  Those of you who keep track of such things , I am sure will compare and contrast how it does relative to other Hypex based implementations.Signal to noise ratio is good reaching excellence at full power:Frequency response is orderly for a class D amplifier which needs an output filter to truncate switching frequency:32-tone source trying to simulate \"music\" shows very low levels of intermodulation distortion:But for a peak at 60 Hz (typo in the graph), the distortion-free range is 110 dB or about 18 bits.Crosstalk is also very good:Most important data is power into 4 and 8 ohm versus distortion and noise.  So let's start with 4 ohm:So not class leading but low distortion while providing 300 or so watts before sudden rise in distortion.  Spec is higher but one can have more data points at the limit and gradually walk up the curve, and hence squeeze out a few more watts.  I will show this later.For 4 ohm load, here is the comparison to our state-of-the-art in class D amplification in the form of Purifi reference design:Purifi maintains the lead in distortion but produces a bit less power.I was able to run my tough test of THD+N at 0.1% versus frequencies.  Some amplifiers have died trying to run this test.  Others are had to poinpoint as their distortion jumps all over the place:We see that at 1 kHz we normally measure, power is almost near max.  Above that we reach nearly 360 watts.  At 20 kHz though, distortion shoots way up and we are able to only produce 22 watts before THD+N of 0.1% is hit.  Fortunately there is not much music energy there so practical audible concern is low.I made a survey of a few of the tracks in my music library.  Peak energy seems to hover around 40 Hz.  For that reason, I have started to measure amount of power at 40 Hz and here, we have 316 watts which is good.Finishing off, switching frequency is around 400 kHz:The noise doesn't scale with power though.  Plotting the same at max power with source frequency of 40 Hz gives us this:And intermodulation distortion using 19+20 kHz at 5 watts output into 4 ohm:ConclusionsThe ATI AT522NC seems like a solidly built amplifier based on Hypex NC500 modules.  ATI builds amplifiers for many other companies and this competence shows up in this review.  Performance is of course limited by what the NC500 module can do.  Use of linear power supply defeats the size and weight advantages of common class D amplifiers.  It may provide better peak power rating -- something I wanted to test but forgot.  Overall, I can recommend the ATI AT522NC stereo amplifier.--------As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.Watching important news on TV as I type this so no positive energy to think of a lame joke.

The M28 costs US $4999 through its dealers.As with the M27 amplifier I reviewed, the M28 comes in the same gorgeous industrial design:At nearly 50 pounds, this is a heavy amplifier likely due to the weight of the enclosure as the class D amplifiers and it switching power supply are light.The one thing I am not a fan of is the touch on/off button on top.  It is not responsive.

      " Buckeye Hypex NC502MP 8-channel class D amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $2,295.There is not a whole lot to look at here.  Sheet metal is rather thin and fitment not that great.  So put it in a cabinet and forget about it.  The backside shows the expected including trigger control to sequence powering up multiple units with one stroke:I was surprised by the weight of the amplifier. Mind you, it is far lighter than a class AB amplifier but it is still not light.  The reason for that is that each amplifier module has a large vertical heatsink with quite stout mounting bracket tying it to the chassis.If you are not familiar with Hypex NC502MP, it is an all-in-one high power stereo amplifier with on-board switching power supply and input buffer.  Supply the connectors and you have a complete amplifier.  In this case, four such modules are included to get to 8 channel.  Due to large amount of power these amplifiers can produce in tandem, dual AC inputs are provided.  The amplifiers are split between the two AC inputs.  If you don't need continuous power, you can connect both inputs to the same power strip which is how I tested it.Buckeye Hypex NC502MP Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard by measuring one amplifier module's dual outputs:Performance is very good as we expect from Hypex modules.  A minor issue was the power supply spikes in one channel (blue). I tested all the amplifier modules and they all do the same thing.  So likely is due to leakage from the onboard power supply bleeding into the more adjacent channel on NC502MP.  Using the \"good\" channel on each board removes that bit of bleeding:Using the former SINAD for ranking, the amplifier nicely lands in our \"excellent\" bucket:Here is all of them in that category:Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and changing the load has no impact on output:Multitone shows the superb performance, albeit somewhat worsened by the less good channel:Noise performance is extremely good:My target is 96 dB at 5 watts which the Buckeye nicely exceeds.  And provides full transparency up to reference level of 120 dBSPL.Crosstalk naturally is beyond approach if you use two separate modules but even in the same module, it is excellent:Let's measure power into 4 ohm using channels in the same module or two separate ones:As you see, there is no difference.  You are only limited by how much AC power you have as power supplies are not shared.Max and peak power is impressive:We are talking nearly 1.3 Kilowatts in stereo!  Needless to say, if you are going to have all 8 channels whaling, you better have good amount of current on dual AC lines.  And make an appointment at your ear, nose and throat doctor because hearing damage is most likely!Measuring response at 8 ohm gave me a really hard time:Reason being that online specs from Hypex does not show that hump from 10 to 100 watts at all.  I tried everything from testing my instrumentation to measuring every amplifier module and still got the same results.  I shared the graph with Buckeye only to be told there is updated measurements from Hypex showing the same hump.    While performance is superb up to about 8 watts, I wish that the hump wasn't so pronounced.I was most impressed by the ability of these modules to drive down to 2 ohms with both capacitive and inductive loads:It produces the same 53 volts no matter what!  At 1 ohm though, it instantly went into protection but recovered very quickly.This is one powerful and robust amplifier!Finally, you don't really need to warm it up:FYI, I left the unit on overnight and in the morning, the top was warm especially in the center.  All the amps combined, do generate some amount of heat so best to not leave it on if you don't need it and provide good ventilation.ConclusionsThe Buckeye NC502MP is a perfect amplifier for home theater duty. It provides incredible amount of power from each module to drive even the most inefficient speakers to ear piercing levels.  It does so with extremely low noise and excellent distortion at modest levels.  At higher powers, distortion does climb.  While I wish this was lower, I don't think there is an issue at all for home theater applications.  Even with music, I think you will be fine but the purist may want to have better.  Then again, if you are going to lose power to get there, this amplifier may be a better choice.I am going to put the Buckeye NC502MP 8-channel amplifier on my recommended list.EDIT: teardown now posted: always,\n",
      " Buckeye Hypex NC502MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased and drop shipped to me by our dear moderator, @AdamG247.  I don't know what it costs.Not sure what there is to say about the case:Or the back panel:Other than the fact that it has trigger switch and that the XLR connectors are upside down.  You need to use two hands to unlock and then pull out the cable.  And heaven help you if you don't know there is a locking tab underneath and you keep trying to yank out the cable anyway! In use, the amplifier is very robust, going into and out of protection with no shut downs (when overdriven).  Note however that once it starts to clip, there is a high pitch whine from the power supply inductors.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started my testing with the amplifier module all the way to the left in the picture above (opposite of AC input).  Here is our warm up graph:Was glad to see the unit stabilize in a couple of minutes so I did not have to wait forever.  Once there, here is our dashboard:I don't know what is going on with the channel in blue producing a lot more power supply noise (relatively speaking).  Grounding made no difference.  As a result, one channel is 3 dB better than the other.  Averaging the two still lands the amp into our upper tier of all amplifiers tested to date:Despite the power supply issue above, signal to noise ratio is excellent and superb if driven to max power:Frequency response shows no sign of load dependency which can be common in class D amplifiers:Multitone test gets polluted by the aforementioned power supply interference:Crosstalk was not as good as I expected although in grand scheme of things, it is not bad:Let's see how much power this thing can pump out starting with 4 ohm load:We have more distortion than I like but that comes with a ton more power than our more accurate but less powerful amplifiers.  Allow 1% distortion and we get even more:Very impressive considering that you have 6 channels in this lightweight enclosure!As noted, power did not increase when I split the measurement between two independent modules at each end of the case. This indicates we are amplifier limited, not power supply (each module has its own power supply).Switch to 8 ohm we get better noise and distortion although the main issue is still there:Multichannel PerformanceI thought I was all set for measuring more than 2 channels only to find out the balanced cables I had bought had the wrong gender.    So all I could do was drive 3 channels at once:What you see is the same stereo pair measured with and without the extra channel also being driven (not shown in the graph).  There is no impact at all which makes sense as these are independent modules and nothing but the power cord is shared between them.Looking for consistency between the modules, I measured each one separately:ConclusionsWhile still way ahead of countless amplifier designs, the Hypex NC502MP modules are built more for power than ultra low distortion.  Not a bad compromise considering the fact that running out of power is quite audible and rise in distortion probably not.  Beauty of class D amplification is showcased by Buckeye in producing six times 600 watts of amplification in a light, and compact case.  I will do a teardown later but so far, I am happy with what is there, sans the upside down XLR connectors.EDIT: Teardown posted: always,\n",
      " boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2 stereo class D amplifier. It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs €649.00 Tax excluded (US $735).I really like the differentiated look of the unit with custom front panel and white case which you can see better in this shot:Notice the ultra high quality and large binding posts and nice power switch.  Input is only balanced XLR as you see.  I believe the heart of the unit is Hypex NC122MP.boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2 MeasurementsThe unit stabilized quickly with its performance hardly changing (I optimized the cabling after this measurement so don't worry about channel difference):Here is our dashboard:This level of distortion and noise (SINAD) nicely landed the amp into our \"excellent\" category:Signal to noise ratio was excellent, achieving better than CD dynamic range at just 5 watts of output:Typical of Hypex amplifiers (in a good way) is lack of load impedance dependency which plagues many budget class D amplifiers:The 2408/N2 achieved one of the lowest crosstalk I have measured:Multitone results are very good as well:Let's see how much power we have:Not a ton but it is above average as far as noise and distortion.  Allowing a bit more distortion we get:Which is right on the money as far as company specifications.  Here is 8 ohm performance:Checking for frequency dependence we see well behaved response:But note the loss of power with 20 Hz input.Finally, here is the switching and ultrasonic performance:I checked the unit for temperature after all the test and could barely feel any rise above room temp on any of the surfaces.ConclusionsThe Arthur 2408 comes in an attractive and differentiated package with very high quality connectivity.  Measured performance is hugely above average although not state of the art.  I could not find any weakness in its performance no matter which way I measured it -- a sign of excellent engineering.  The cost is up there though for the level of power you get.  Seeing how company is represented here (@boXem | audio), support should be easy as well.I am happy to recommend the boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2.

      "This is review and detailed measurements of the KJF Audio MA-01 6-channel Amplifier populated with Hypex NC252MP stereo modules.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  I configured it using their online tool and it shows a cost of US $1,868.Not much to see or talk about as far as the case other than dual fans on top:Thankfully they did not come on during my testing but it is good insurance to have given the total power this unit can generate.The rear panel shows the usual balanced inputs although in this case it is 1/4 inch/XLR combo jacks:For my testing, I focused on channels 1 and 2.  Did plan to test the rest of the channels for total power but forgot that I had no way of generating that many balanced outputs so what you are about to see is for stereo only.  Seeing how the amp modules are stereo anyway, this should be representative of what you get even if turned on the rest of them at full power.KJF MA-01 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:We expect excellent performance from Hypex and we get it there, producing well above average SINAD which represents level of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is very high indicating a very quiet amplifier:32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" shows very low distortion as well:Frequency response is essentially flat with almost no dependency on whether I used 4 or 8 ohm test load:This means the frequency response should not change much when you switch one speaker for another (an issue with cheap desktop amplifiers).Crosstalk is very good:The meat of an amplifier review is the amount of power versus distortion+noise so let's start with 4 ohm:Spec is 250 watts which is what we get if we allow more distortion than I do in the above graph:Seems that the power supply is designed to power the amp exactly as specified and no more and hence the lack of increase on bursts (above right).Switching to 8 ohm we get:I like the lower noise with 8 ohm better than 4 ohm.Finally, there is a bit too much disturbance when we change frequency and sweep for power than I like:But as noted on the graph, there are far worse examples.ConclusionsThe hypex NC252MP stereo amplifier modules do their job to product above average performance while running cool and efficient.  While I have not yet looked inside the KJF amp, from the outside it seems like they have not done anything to lower the performance of these nice modules.I am going to put the KJF MA-01 with Hypex NC252MP on my recommended list.Edit: see teardown here: always,\n",

      "This is the measurements of the March Audio P502 class D amplifier based on Hypex (?) modules.  It was kindly send to me by a member for testing.  The P502 costs US $1,075 from the company direct.This is not a review because the @March Audio is a long time member of the forum and I like to avoid conflict of interest.The unit comes in attractive aluminum packaging:On off control is a touch button which is unusual in power amplifiers.Here is a shot of the back:In hard use, the bottom plate gets quite warm.  Make sure you have plenty of ventilation from below.  A taller set of feet would help with this.My heavy stress test of frequency versus power caused the unit to shut down momentarily.  I did not retry it as I don't want to risk damaging the unit.Warm Up TestAs is my standard practice now, I warm up and measure distortion and noise until the device stabilizes.  For amps, I do this at 5 watts.  Here are the results:As you see the channel in red is having a harder time, showing fair bit worse performance than the other.  It did improve momentarily after power up but then went back to the same state.  I checked all of my cabling and it was all secure.  So don't know if this is an assembly issue or sample to sample variation.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Per warm up test, we see one channel with higher noise floor and differing distortion products.  Averaging the two channels still puts the P502 well above average amplifier:Frequency response was essentially flat in audible band with a resistive dummy load or my speaker simulator:Crosstalk was good enough and predictable:32-tone test simulating \"music\" shows that 1 kHz is actually the point of higher distortion.  Below and above performance improves:Signal to noise ratio is quite good:Except for the one channel lagging behind.  We are talking about 16+ bits at 5 watts reaching up to nearly 20 bits at full power.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet's start with 4 ohm load:That is a ton of power with very low distortion.  Letting the distortion go up to 1% gets us even more:Switching to 8 ohm load we get:ConclusionsLots and lots of power in above average performance and small package.  If you are going to drive a sub with it at full power, you may want to deploy more cooling/ventilation on the bottom.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I don't want to come across as too obvious with respect to asking for money.

      " IOM NCore Pro, Hypex NC252MP class-d based stereo power amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs €669 from the company website.The IOM Ncore Pro comes in very compact and solid enclosure:The on/off button feels very good but I find the fonts very cheesy.  That same theme continues in the back:I could not even read those fonts on the gain toggle switch until I took the above picture! Great to see XLR balanced inputs in addition to RCA.  Note the unusual, horizontal placement of the left and right speaker terminals.  I am used to them being stacked vertically when they are so close to each other.In use the top of the amp barely increased in temperature.  The bottom was a bit more warm but nothing remotely of any concern.  There were no shutdowns.  However, I did not try to stress load it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt into 4 ohm test.  I chose the XLR input and low (XLR) gain for all of these tests:The SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) of 94 dB places the OMI Ncore Pro in the upper tier of amplifiers/AVRs tested:Which was a relief after testing a number of home theater amplifiers that stacked on the right of the graph.Frequency response is dead flat but not super wide:Signal to noise ratio at max power output before clipping into 4 ohm was quite respectable:Here is the intermodulation distortion at very high frequencies (19 and 20 Khz tones):You have well over 16 bits of distortion free at modest listening levels.  Keep in mind that your music never has such high amplitudes at these frequencies.  So in practice, the distortion will vanish into noise.Crosstalk performance was excellent:The meat of any amplifier review is power versus distortion and noise.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Shame to see the early rise in distortion starting at 20 watts.  That aside, you have considerable amount of power clocking at 236 watts, both channels driven in this tiny enclosure.Switching to 8 ohm load we get:Now the early rise in distortion is more modest.  We get 125 watts of power at a SINAD of 91 db.  Interesting to compare it to Purifi 1E400A which produces similar power but a whopping 130 dB SINAD or 40 dB better!Peak power is sadly not much more than steady state due likely to regulated power supplies:Good thing the baseline level of power is quite good.ConclusionsThe IOM NCore Pro amp is a solid performer courtesy of competent hypex NC252MP class D amplifier modules.  The packaging is nice and tidy and the price seems reasonable to me.No, you are not getting state of the art performance.  That is in another category altogether.  But that level of performance will cost you more money and comes in a larger package.Overall I am happy to recommend the IOM NCore Pro amplifier. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The days are starting to get shorter here and rainy seasons is arriving.

      " Buckeye Hypex NC252MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It costs US $1149 as of this writing.  The owner/builder is @Buckeye Amps on our forum.The looks are fine for a well-priced build:The unit is quite light courtesy of rather thin sheet metal.  I am not as worried about the top being thin but the bottom is as well and that is where heat is generated.  You won't likely push all three modules to max but if you did, I would put taller feet under it and maybe even some temperature controlled fans.  In my testing the bottom just got a bit warm so not a major concern.Back panel shows standard connectors plus the trigger input:I stopped using my Mogami Gold XLR cables because I wanted to have colored ones.  I bought a batch from Amazon that is nice and flexible cabling but some kind of generic XLR connectors.  I have found them to be a hair worse than my Mogami cables as far as fit.  On the Buckeye amp though, I could barely get them into the XLR connectors and then back out.  I tried other XLR cables and my other generic ones were also stiff.  The Mogami cable however, was a bit tight but nothing as bad as my generic ones.  I know tolerances very but I had not seen this level of compatibility before with any other gear I have tested.  Anyway, it is a one-shot deal so not a big deal even if the problem exists.Buckeye NC252MP MeasurementsInternally we have three stereo amplifier modules.  So I decided to drive the unit in stereo using first and last channels.  This way we have some variation in modules and their placements.  Here are the results:Hypex spec is 0.002% which we are meeting here.  I could not figure out why the one channel had so much more mains noise (blue).  I tried every kind of grounding but it made no difference at all.  SINAD though is dominated by the second harmonic so that noise is not so material in that regard:So quite competent and better than any mass market AVR amplifier.Frequency response is pretty good for a class D amplifier:Signal to noise ratio is excellent even with that extra mains hum.  It nicely clears the noise floor of a 16-bit digital format:Crosstalk naturally was superb when measuring two different modules but also good in stereo mode in one module:Fascinating that a DIY amplifier can be so good whereas many premium audio products we test struggle here.Let's get into the meat of the review which is the power into 4 ohm load:The red pair of lines is using the two channels out of one amplifier module.  We see healthy amount of power to the tune of 224 watts each. Strangely when I tried two different modules (first and last as before), performance dropped some in both channels even though one channel is the same as before!  Maybe the two amps are fighting each other a bit for current.  Or there is some kind of beat frequency between them.  Not a real worry though as far as audibility but interesting nonetheless.Typical of these class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, there is no peak power:Here is our output with 8 ohm load:Testing for frequency dependency, we get good results as we expect from Hypex modules:ConclusionsI don't know the module price for the amps within this unit but getting 6 channels of amplification with such performance is a heck of a deal.  You are benefitting from a DIY person building these for you with no intention of making a living.    I will do a teardown soon and we can see if the internal build is good. I am happy to recommend the Buckeye 6 channel, NC252MP based amplifier.-----As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      "This is a review and detailed measurements of Accuphase E-270 Integrated Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from our friends at Gig Harbor Audio.  It is their demo unit so I have to return it on Tuesday.  So if you need something else to be measured, ask right away!  The E-270 was released in 2017 I think and retails for USD $5,000.  This is not cheap by our normal standards but in high-end audio, this is a pretty reasonable price.The industrial design of the unit seemingly has not changed from 1980s era with beautiful VU meters (with acceleration):At 44 pounds, the unit is quite heavy for its capabilities.  There is a massive transformer in the middle of the unit and the power amplifier modules with beefy heatsinks sit on either side.  During my testing, I could not even get the unit to become warm let alone hot!  It runs so comfortably that one thinks it is never going to stress out.The front has a slick finish that is lovely to touch.  Volume control is implemented through resistor ladders and hence has electronic control.  Accuphase says it has 6,500 steps which should be plenty for listening although was a bit difficult to dial in the exact value for measurements.There are slots in the back for optional DAC and phono stage (?) which mine did not have. All in all this is the type of construction, look and feel that would justify paying good bit of premium over a budget product. Given the likely reliability that comes from a high-end product from Japan, I say the stage is set for a good impression.Note: seeing how this is a demo unit to be sold, I did NOT attempt to stress the unit.  No long term warm up and certainly no stress test.  Given the overdesigned thermal design here though, I am not worried about the measurements holding under thermal stress.MeasurementsFor reasons that will become clear later, I decided to test the power amplifier section first.  Accuphase makes this dead easy with a front-panel button \"MAIN IN\" that decouples the power amp input from pre-amp output.  This allowed me to test the power amplifier separately and compare its performance to recently tested power amps.  So let's start with our 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:I have added two more panels here: gain and dc output.  Have not verified the latter but should be correct.  As we see there is a 0.4 dB gain error and variation in distortion level.  The loads I use are not precision types (none are at these high power levels) so some of this may be instrumentation.  I did match levels (not shown) and distortion levels and differentials remained the same. At 92 to 95 dB SINAD, we are getting in territory of transparency for CD music.  The two distortion products are second and third harmonic at around -100 dB.Signal to Noise ratio is very good at 116 dB+:The E-270 is rated at 120 watts and it blows way past that to the tune of 155 watts prior to clipping (green pair):You can see the comparison to recently reviewed Onkyo M-282.  The E-270 outperforms it in every category from lower noise floor and distortion to more power prior to clipping.  The Onkyo of course is a budget product at $300. On not so good news, the Hypex based NC400 amplifier way outshines the Accuphase E-270.  It has far less noise, distortion and much more power. Whoever thinks class AB amplifiers are better than switching ones like NC400, this is the time to cry!  Pre-amplifierLet's isolate the pre-amplifier and measure it at unity gain (same level output that is input):Wow, that is quite a bit better than the power amplifier with much lower noise floor and distortion.  Don't get too excited though.  There are some really odd things going on here.  Let's switch inputs to XLR:What the heck??? We lost 10 dB of performance.What is really, really strange is that if I measure RCA but leave the XLR cables connected, performance drops way down just the same!   You can see it easily in signal to noise ratio measurements:Accuphase hints at much lower performance of XLR input in the specs for the product:This aside, note as I have shown on the FFT chart above how we have lots and lots of power supply related spikes.  This is evident in an FFT of the spectrum (power amp only):Switching power supplies like used in Hypex NC400 amplifier shown in the inset in blue convert mains to DC and then convert it back to AC at hundreds much higher frequency (above audible frequencies).  As a result, you are free of mains related noise in good implementations.    There is no denying how clean the Hypex NC400 amplifier is in the audible band.  The Accuphase E-270 in contrast while cleaner than budget Onkyo M-282, has a ton of noise spikes.The problematic area for switching amplifiers is in the high frequencies so let's look at that:The levels of noise and spurious tones is of course quite a bit lower than switching amplifiers.  We once again see that XLR input has worse performance (see zoomed inset).Let's now re-measure the power versus distortion using the E-270's pre-amp:We have a repeat of issues with XLR input again.  Notice the performance of RCA input with (red) and without XLR (blue) cable connected but not used.  And of course we leave fair amount of performance on the table with respect to the power amplifier alone. It seems that loading the pre-amp with the power amp reduces its performance substantially.  I traced this to pre-amp getting severely distorted when the power amp is under stress.  There is lack of isolation/independent power supply for the pre-amp.Story is the same with intermodulation distortion versus level:Interestingly enough the level sensitivity for XLR is the same as RCA.  I should be able to swing that to 4 volts for the same output with RCA at 2 volts.Frequency response falls in the category of very good news:I left the levels different for each input so that the graphs don't fall on top of each other.  The power amplifier (blue) has the flattest response but by just a bit.  There is really no issue in the audible band to 20 kHz.ConclusionsOn fit and finish, the Accuphase E-270 integrated Amplifier delivers for a product in low thousands of dollars.  It has the nostalgic look of 1980s product which is popular now and certainly different than common mass market products.  Its power amplifier has respectable and conservative specifications.  Measurements show it to produce far more power than stated with massive thermal capacity which should spell long service life.Unfortunately I think there are some serious engineering issues in the pre-amplifier.  The XLR input not only generates much worse performance on its own, but also serves to pollute the performance of RCA input!  There is not sufficient power/isolation for the pre-amp causing its performance to sag when the unit is asked to produce a lot of power.  These are faults that I don't tolerate in mass market products, let alone higher end ones.I would say if you want to get an Accuphase product, get a power amplifier.  The integrated unit as tested just doesn't do that job so sadly, I cannot recommend it.EDIT: update the price to the correct one ($5,000 instead of $4,500).-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.They say you should save money for a rainy day.

      "This is a review and measurements of the Schiit Aegir stereo Power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member who has been patiently waiting since August for its review!  The Aegir is sold direct by Schiit and costs US $799 plus shipping.The Aegir is very heavy, substantial and serious looking piece of audio gear in black:What I don't like is the extra sharp edges of the heatsinks on each side where you naturally want to grab it.  But I understand extruded aluminum comes this way and having the corners marchined would be expensive.Here is the back panel:At first I was super excited to see the XLR input but became puzzled why a stereo amp only has one of them.  Then I realized that it is only for driving the unit in bridged mode.  So for most of my testing I used RCA and then used XLR for bridged power testing.I can't quite tell what type of amplifier this is from technical terms Schiit uses.  They seem to want to say this is mostly a class A amplifier but then it isn't at higher power?  Anyway, the Aegir runs warm but not too hot so whatever trick they are using to lower power consumption of this unit versus pure class A is working.The Aegir is a new design which was introduced in 2018.  I see Audio Precision measurements for it which means it is part of the new design philosophy to take measurements and design verification seriously.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard feeding a 1 kHz tone into the amp, aiming for 5 watt output into 4 ohm:Starting on the left side, the gain of 20 dB is on the low side.  Then again the output power is so low (see later) that you don't need a lot of gain to get to maximum power.SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) which is a positive dB version of THD+N mathematically (here anyway), puts the Aegir in respectable, above average ranking of all power amplifiers tested:We see good bit of power supply spikes which I verified to also exist in Schiit AP measurements.  Levels are below -100 dB so likely not audible due to our poor sensitivity in low frequencies.Frequency response is ruler flat in audible band:Signal to noise ratio is good, matching what we need for 16 bit audio playback:Multitone test tells us intermodulation between 32 tones fed to the amplifier:Once again, we see that we clear the 16 bit threshold of CD music.Most important test is power versus THD+N.  Let's see that for 8 ohm:Schiit rates this amp at 20 watts into 4 ohm so we are close.  Likely they allow 1% distortion versus my standard of onset of clipping.What is puzzling is 4 ohm output:We are long ways away from 40 watts.  Then again, the clipping tilts to the right some so I suppose if you walked up that curve far enough, you get to 40 watts.  You would get good bit of distortion though so 40 watts is a marketing number.Note that one channel is more unhappy than the other.  I confirmed that exists just as well in Schiit measurements.  So likely power is fed is less efficiently to one amp than the other.  Or there are grounding, component mismatch, etc..To test bridged mode, I fed the Aegir vial XLR balanced connection and got this:I only get 23 watts of usable power which is hardly more than 19.5 watts I got in stereo mode.  The curve tilts to the right more now so marketing department went to town there to spec the \"80 watt number.\"  Measuring dynamic power which uses 1% number Schiit uses, we do get much more power:So with real music, you likely have more power than my continuous tone tests indicate.Let's test how sensitive the Aegir is to input frequency:Sort of a classic output in that lower frequencies limit the amount of power available (clips earlier) but also have lower distortion.  I was asked to add multitone test to my amplifier measurements.  I usually use that for DACs since there, it is a lossless signal.  To use it for amplifiers, the signal has to be converted from PCM to analog which invokes the DAC in the AP.  That would put a limit on how good of a measurement I can make.  For amps like Aegir is not a limitation though so here it is:We see the general distortion floor is around -100 bits or 17 bits.  However, there are some earlier spikes due to power supply noise.  Again, our hearing is not very sensitive in that region so they can be ignored.ConclusionsThe Schiit Aegir is a competently designed amplifier with solid build quality and no design mistakes.  It shows the power of proper measurements and engineering verification to remove the element of surprise in third-party verification job we perform here.The main issue here is lack of power.  To someone like me, with very large spaces, rather inefficient speakers and desire for bass that you feel as much as you here, the Aegir is definitely not for me.  Nor do I buy into \"Class A\" having any benefit.  If it had, it would show up in measurements.  It does not.If have efficient speakers and/or don't listen very loud, the Aegir is a solid offering from a western company.  I am going to put the Schiit Aegir on my recommended list for its solid engineering and design.  Fitness for application is up to you!  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.It is getting cold here and they say winter will bring more snow than usual.

      "This is a review and detailed measurements of a refurbished and upgraded NAD 2200 stereo amplifier. It was bought by a member, sent to QuirkAudio to be fully updated and then loaned to me. The work that Peter has done is exemplary.  The inside looks brand new! I have repaired hundreds of amplifiers but never seen one this clean!  So not only have the inside components been updated/replaced, but a lot of care has gone to cosmetically clean the unit. Peter sent me a long list of parts he has upgraded including reservoir capacitors and such. As a result, I don't know how representative of measurements are of stock units although probably not too far off. Used 2200 go for about US $530 on ebay.The front panel is nice with an informative clipping indicator:As you see, you can put the amp in bridge mode (which I did not test) and select whether you want soft clipping on.  I left it off as you see in the picture.During use the protection circuit came on when appropriate and nicely reset as if nothing had happened.The NAD 2200 uses a dual voltage rail to keep power consumption and heat dissipation low when producing lower power and then upping the voltage for peak power.  This is a common technique but usually applied to low baseline power level.  Here, 100+ watts of power is provided using the low voltage power supply rail and it is only for power above that where the higher voltage is used.  Technique worked quite well as you see later and kept the amplifier cool and happy during my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Not bad!  Distortion is at or below -100 dB.  With noise, SINAD degrades to about 93 dB putting the 2200 well above average of nearly 100 amplifiers tested to date:Notice that the gain is quite high at 32 dB.  Common range is 25 to 29 dB with the latter being a \"THX\" standard.  The higher gain increases noise so despite that, performance is as good as seen.  High gain makes it a good fit for AVRs for example that produce distorted output well below nominal 2 volts.Frequency response has a sharp roll off which seems to indicate the output is not direct coupled (DC) as is common today:Or maybe it is on purpose, I don't know.Crosstalk is very good:As is dynamic range:It is power measurements where the magic of this amplifier comes to life so let's look at that with 4 ohm load first:We can see a kink in distortion when we hit 200 watts as the unit sails past that to produce whopping 337 watts per channel, both driven!  Per design characteristics, you can have much more during momentary peaks:Wow, we have one kilowatt of power coming out of this amp in short duration!Switching to 8 ohm we see similar results as 4 ohm:Sweeping the power test at 4 ohm with different frequencies shows a well-behaved amplifier:You do loose power in higher frequencies but that is fine since music spectrum has lower energy there anyway.Due to the long duration of this test, the protection circuit likely backed off the high voltage rail, producing lower output levels.EDIT: adding Lab Input MeasurementsLab Input MeasurementsI was surprised that the frequency response was not flat but was relieved to see later in the thread that this is due to insertion of low and high pass filters.  So here is the frequency response with Lab input that doesn't have such a filter:Response now (in green) as it should be, ruler flat to below 10 Hz, and well extending past the 40 kHz limit of this measurement.I figured the filters may be adding some noise/distortion so re-ran the dashboard again:Distortion doesn't change but if you look at the noise floor at 20 Hz, it is down by some 10 dB.  That improves SINAD a couple of dBs, making the amplifier stand out even more!Zoomed:And signal to noise ratio:ConclusionsNice to see innovation like this from equipment that is over 30 years old!  Shame on manufacturers that produce amplifiers for much less power, more distortion and higher prices these days.  No, you don't get a fancy case here and sheet metal is strictly budget category.  But you are not going to sit on the amp.  The guts are where it matters and NAD 2200 delivers.NOTE: the output relay on stock 2200 gets corroded and fails over time.  There are videos and DIY threads on how to upgrade the relay there to fix the problem.  The unit tested here has that fix.  Other than that, there are not reports of many other reliability issues even though NAD products are often said to be less reliable than other brands.Overall, I am happy to recommend the NAD 2200.  I almost gave it the highest honors but given the upgraded nature of the test unit, and the fact that used amps may have issues, I avoided that.  But you could have easily pushed me to give it the golfing panther.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Look folks: I need to stay healthy so I can do these reviews for as long as I possibly can.

      " Devialet Expert 200 Amplifier, DAC, Phono premaplifier and wired streamer.  It seems to be a generation behind the current products offered by Devialet.  The Expert 200 cost US $9,650. The Devialet line of amplifiers made quite a buzz when originally announced given its unique, lifestyle packaging which has not changed yet:A combination of class A amplifier and class D current source is used to keep the size down, and efficiency up. Innovative for its time was inclusion of an SD card and online configurator to change the operation of the unit including re-purposing the back RCA connectors:The thin package creates real compromises here with the exclusion of balanced analog inputs or preamp outputs. Usability suffers quite a bit as well with the display being on top of the unit which simply is not visible from afar.  There is provision for wall-mounting but come on, no audiophile is going to do that and then dangle the cables from it.There is a very substantial remote but strangely has no display on it.  That would consume a lot more power, likely requiring a charger and such.Trying to troubleshoot a problem let me to going to their configurator site and downloading SD images some 10 times.  I have to tell you, it gets old taking the SD card out of the unit, plugging it into a PC, making a simple change, put it back in the unit, wait for a restart, to see the effect.  Granted, you only do this once in a while but during experimentation is quite tedious.  In this day and age, such configurator should be inside the unit and activated vi an app or with a browser.  The data on the SD card is very small anyway (some kind of simple text file).  So it is not like it is data intensive.Overall, I think looks are put way ahead of function on Davialet amplifiers. I had planned to do a much more extensive review of this unit but sadly, right after my first power sweep, it shut down and no longer powers back on.    The online brochure talks extensive about protection measures.  Clearly they are not enough as I suspect the microprocessor board has failed as opposed to the amplifier that has health monitoring.  I am hoping Devialet is responsive to this review and failure and make good on repairing this unit.  I have never had an amplifier fail in such a simple sweep that keeps the power max for just a few seconds.Anyway, I had accumulated enough data that I thought it is worthwhile to post it while waiting for a response from Devialet.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsThe Devialet amplifiers digitize their analog inputs so I thought I start with our dashboard of 5 watts driving using USB input:Distortion products are quite low at < -110 dB.  However, the noise floor is high in low frequencies causing our SINAD to suffer a lot, ending with a metric of 92 dB.  This is well above average compared to all the amplifiers we have measured but way short of state-of-the-art:Analog input creates a lot of harmonic distortion and with it, drags down SINAD a few notches still:I don't understand how their ADC could distort so much in a product this expensive.  It can't even clear 15 bits of distortion-free range.There are some lofty numbers like -130 dB noise floor is thrown around by Devialet.  I am not sure how that is computed.  Using analog Line-in for consistency with other amplifier measurements we get rather ordinary numbers:Crosstalk is good but again, not state of the art:At this point I went to measure a simple frequency response and got stomped  big time.  No matter what I did, the output would drop off randomly between 8 and 10 kHz.  As mentioned, I messed with the configurator, doing everything in my power to turn off filters, tone controls, etc., nothing helped.  So I dug in with just feeding the amp a 15 kHz tone and noticed that the output would jump up and down especially in one channel!  What the heck is going on????My frequency response testing is at 5 watts as that is what I use in my dashboard.  Turns out this amplifier cannot reproduce high frequencies reliably at 5 watts!  It has some kind of limiter that kicks in and pulls power back.  It also does that at low frequencies but at or past maximum power.  That I can sort of understand but not the high frequency hold back.  To see this in action, I ran my THD+N vs Level vs Power test:Focus on the red line first.  That is at 20 kHz.  Notice how it actually zigzags back and forth as input level is increased, but output level does not.  Or even goes backward!  This must be the \"good\" channel as it produced 10 watts.  The other channel was more finicky and as noted, would get upset at even 5 watts.Problem severity goes down with frequencies but still there at 10 kHz as indicated by the light blue line which zips back at around 180 watts or so.At lower frequencies, the amp simply refuses to increase power and not go into clipping.With this knowledge, I reduced output power to below 1 watt and ran my frequency response sweep:This is line-in so is digitized.  It produces about 48 kHz of bandwidth which is fine.  What is not so fine is that there is a phase shift between channels as frequencies go up:Some kind of filter is active here that is causing a phase shift between channels.  Even if there is some processing active (which there shouldn't be as I disabled tone control and \"SAM\" speaker EQ), it should affect both channels equally as far as phase.Our story ends with my power measurement as noted:This is healthy amount of power at 269 watts with both channels driven into 4 ohms.ConclusionsWhile the Devialet is an elegant looking audio device, it clearly sacrifices usability and reliability/performance to get there.  There is something clearly wrong in the way it handles high frequencies.  No, this is not just me saying that.  It is also buried in the stereophile measurement of another one of their units: $10,000\n",
      " Emotiva PA-1 monoblock class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and unfortunately discontinued.  When it was being sold, it cost $299.There is not much to look at here other than a blue indicator for when the unit is on:It is a balanced amplifier which is nice:There is an automatic trigger as you see. I tested it using always-on mode.I believe this is based on some ICEPower module from B&O (300AS1?).  In use the PA-1 didn't even get warm to touch.  Protection circuit was very good in that if you overload it, it clips but keeps going.  Other amps shut down requiring power cycling and such which an become annoying in my testing.Emotiva PA-1 MeasurementsOur standard dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm (1 kHz tone) shows very good performance:Distortion is at -100 dB which is quite nice making SINAD around 92 dB:This is well above our average of 78 across nearly 140 amplifiers tested to date.SNR is very good nearly matching my target of 96 dB at 5 watts:Multitone shows the same good performance:Frequency response unfortunately shows dependency on speaker impedance:Power into 4 ohm shows early rise of distortion:I cut off the power early in that graph.  If one allows it to go higher in distortion it produces a lot more power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Changing frequency shows what non-state-of-the-art class Ds produce:Namely a transfer function that changes with frequency and much higher distortion.Here is the spectrum of the switching frequency:ConclusionsIt is hard to get perfection at this price point but the Emotiva PA-1 tries hard.  It is a small package that runs cool yet produces well above average noise and distortion ratings.  It is a shame it is discontinued.I am going to put the Emotiva PA-1 on my recommended list.  Hopefully you can find some in second hand market or something.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Crappy weekend...

      " Yamaha R-N803 Receiver, amplifier, and streamer.  It was purchased by a member (b-stock?) and drop shipped to me.  The R-N803 costs US $750 from amazon including Prime shipping.The R-N803 has AV-style features such as Room EQ but with only two channels of amplification.  It has a retro look which is quite a bit nicer than an AVR though:Alas, beauty is only skin deep.  Those nice vertical controls are loose and have nowhere near the great feel of the 1970s gear with their solid mechanical selectors.  The back panel shows how the video features have been stripped away:As a package, it is much more appealing than the monster size of typical AVR.  So not a bad effort.Internally there are decent size heat sinks, one for each channel.  This is a huge step up from a shared flimsy heat sinks we see in modern AVRs with many channels.  This resulted in high robustness as in my testing, nothing caused the R-N803 to shut down or go into protection mode.  With AVRs it is common for them to do these things even though I still drive them with just two channels.Receiver Amplifier TestingI exclusively used the CD input for my testing.  There is a button for Pure Direct as there is on AVRs so let's engage that and see what we get:I set the volume control to +3 db to get the nominal 29 dB of gain.  Measurements were not that different at 0 dB.  I had to play fair bit to get rid of some ground loops (this is 2-pin, insulated device).  Once there, I was rewarded with pretty good SINAD which is a combined measure of distortion and noise:As you see, the ranking is way above average of just 77 dB SINAD.Switching off pure direct mode however, causes severe performance drop:Noise floor as moved massively up and distortion has increased.  Now we are back in the poor category of AVRs.  Sadly to use Room EQ you need to operate in this mode so you have a tough decision of whether you want to have low noise/distortion or room EQ.Dynamic range in pure mode is good:As is crosstalk:Frequency response is excellent in pure mode as well:Turning off pure (green) causes a sharp drop near 50 kHz which seems to indicate the input is digitized using 96 kHz sampling.  It is nice that this rate is a lot higher than many AVRs use.  Not so nice is the non-flat response even though I set all the controls to the middle.There is plenty of power into 4 ohm load at lower distortion and noise than a number of AVRs:Switching to 8 ohm load and measuring pure and non-pure modes, shows the poor performance of the latter:I had a slight issue with this test.  Just minor wiggling of the speaker terminals caused one channel to get distorted much earlier.  Not sure what is going on with that.Back to 4 ohm load, we see that we have plenty of headroom for momentary peaks in music:And here is our power test with different frequencies:At low frequencies approaching 20 Hz, distortion rises above 60 watts or so (orange).  Otherwise, this is a predictable performance with high frequencies being a bit more distorted than low.  And this is a good thing compared to nasty curves with get in some switching amplifiers.ConclusionsAs a pure, analog integrated amplifier, the Yamaha R-N803 does well.  It produces ample amount of power into 4 ohm with pretty low distortion and noise.  The visuals are also quite attractive.  Digital mode to use such things as Auto-EQ/filters is rather poor due to similar issues in many AVRs.  Sad that Yamaha did not go the extra mile and produce a better subsystem here.I personally don't like to use an AVR as a stereo setup due to their large size and not so pretty face plate.  So in that regard, I appreciate the Yamaha R-N803.Given the good, pure analog mode performance, and nice looks, I am going to put the Yamaha R-N803 on my recommended list. -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I had a great idea in the shower (where i get my best ideas) of training the pink panthers to pull weeds for me in the garden.

      " Audiophonics DA-S250NC class D amplifier (hypex NC252MP) and stereo DAC/Bluetooth. It was requested by a member and supplied by the company. It costs 582,50 € (tax excluded) (US$641).I really like the front panel display.  It has large font and super responsive rotary encoder that is a delight to use.  The power switch and input selections feel good as well.  Back panel shows the fact that only digital inputs are provided:In use the unit was robust in operation and recovered automatically from overloads.Audiophonics DA-S250NC DAC MeasurementsUsing pre-out, I measured the performance of the DAC.  Let's start with our dashboard:I was surprised that I could not get more than 0.8 volt out of the pre-out. Like to see 2 volts.  Likely this is optimized for the gain setting of the integrated amplifier. Distortion is below -110 dB but because output level is rather low, noise drags that down to SINAD of 103 dB.  This is still competent performance:SNR is good enough for 16 bit content:Linearity is near perfect:Multitone is quite good until you get to upper registers:IMD vs level shows that impact of noise level:There were regular pulses at 1 KHz which is the USB sub-packet buffer size:I tried changing the filter settings but they seemingly made no difference:Might as well as this is a fine choice anyway.  Attenuation could be better, hurting THD+N vs frequency:Overall performance of the DAC is not bad.  Question is, is it good enough to not impact the amplifier performance?Audiophonics DA-S250NC Amplifier MeasurementsUsing the same USB input, I measured performance by setting the front panel volume control to -16.5 dB to get 5 watts and change output:This is very good performance, landing the amplifier well above average of all products ever tested:Zooming in:Noise performance is very good, almost meeting my 16 bit minimum SNR at 5 watts:Frequency response is nice in that it doesn't show any load dependency:Crosstalk is better than average of all amps tested:Multitone test shows very good performance with almost no frequency dependency:I could barely get the amplifier to clip at max digital input/volume control:This tells me that we could have a bit more output voltage from the DAC to drive the amplifier.  This impacts 8 ohm more:Note that you want to operate in clipping region but a bit of power is left on the table as far as measurements are concerned.Since the amplifier barely distorts, I could not run my standard max and peak power using 1% THD metric.  I had to dial that down to 0.3% get max power:I was not able to run burst power due to same issue.  Note again that this is a \"good thing\" in that the amplifier just doesn't distort enough to get more burst power.Let's switch the load now from 8 to 2 ohm while also changing the phase angle as to represent capacitive and inductive loads:I am impressed that it handled 2 ohm at all but 60 degrees capacitive.  Output voltage dropped though so you don't get to keep \"doubling down.\"  Likewise we lose output voltage at the extremes of ± 60 degrees at 4 and 8 ohm.Finally, as I suspected, you get double power on glitch with the amp and DAC powering on in sequence, resulting in some noise:ConclusionsThe DA-S250NC caught my eye from the moment I looked at the website.  The combination of a DAC and class D amplifier just makes sense to me for most people who only want a digital input. Many \"smart\" amplifiers exist in this domain but they are usually compromised.  Seeing a DAC married to hypex amplifier and combined with a nice front panel/remote seemed to be the ticket.  In testing, the DAC performance is just good but seems to be mating well enough to the amplifier.  Any more performance and it would kind be wasted there.  So I can't complain much.  A version of this with higher performance DAC and amplifier would be just dandy!  Overall, I like and recommend the Audiophonics DA-S250NC.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " NAD C 320BEE power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan.  The C 320BEE is a vintage product, dating back to 2003 I think.  The BEE designation is apparently a reference to Bjorn Erik Edvardsen who was one of their designers.  Can't tell if he designed this version or this is based on work he did years earlier.  Either way, I am told it is a \"classic.\"  I don't keep up with such things but I am sure some of you will set me straight if that is, or isn't so.  From what I can tell the original cost was US $399.  So quite a budget piece for a mid-tier brand like NAD.The C 320BEE is typical of NAD design language which is maintained to this day:There are set of tone controls and balance which I appreciate in this day and age when it is removed from most gear.I did not seek out the manual and remain unsure how this thing powers on.  You hit the power button but nothing happens until you press one of the input buttons???Here is the back panel:It is an old school layout with non-removable power cord, jumper set for pre to power map.  And a set of RCA jacks lined up.The unit appears to run cool but there are large holes on the bottom where the amplifier heatsink is and if you touch that heatsink, it gets quite hot.In testing, without undue stress, the unit went into protection and would not reset until I cooled it off with a fan and left it off for a few minutes.  Most amps survive my testing without going into protection mode since I only push them to max power for seconds.Also, in the process of changing my setup for 4 to 8 ohm, the unit went into oscillation, producing 107 watts on its own with no signal.  So there is some instability in the design.  This happened when I changed my load impedance to 8 ohm so perhaps you won't see it if you don't mess with speaker output while the unit is on.To be on the safe side, for the last few tests I put a fan on top to keep it cool and that got it to run very reliably. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet's start with our usual 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:The highest distortion product is at -100 dB.  Since out SINAD (signal to noise and distortion), is only 90 dB, it means there is 10 dB of noise that is degrading that.  All else being equal, noise is less of an audible problem than distortion so that is good.  Take at its value, the C 320BEE clocks much better than many other amplifiers we have measured in this regard:Drilling into the 1 kHz tone spectrum we see the nice clean output of classic AB amplifier:Those of you who hate class-D spectra in ultrasonics, can rejoice now.  Signal to noise ratio is good but is power dependent:I think the spec is a few dBs better than this but I am sure you can mess with levels and volume control position to get there.  Either way, this is plenty clean for CD/16-bit playback.Crosstalk is unremarkable compared to state-of-the-art:Fortunately, this should not be an audible issue as there is plenty of separation between channels here.  Frequency response is broad and quite flat in audible band:Even at 100 kHz, the response is only down 1 dB.  So your high-resolution music can sing without the amplifier truncating their bandwidth.Let's look at intermodulation distortion (two tones at 60 and 7 kHz) versus power output:This is a well-behaved amplifier until it gets to its limit and then clips hard as amplifiers tend to do.  Of note, there is a \"soft clip\" light but I did not see it come on in any of my tests.We can run the same test but with two high frequency tones of 19 and 20 kHz:Forgetting about the ultrasonic ones around 38 kHz, the distortion sidebands remain at -100 dB which is very nice.  You can play your 16 bit content without worrying about any distortion above its noise floor.Most important test is power versus distortion.  Let's start with 4 ohm load:This is very modest level of power but no strangeness in its response.  We can run the test again but compare to modern \"streaming\" amplifiers of today:We have very clean power compared to them but less power as compared to either SONOS or Amazon Link Amp.  The NAD does outperform the NuForce STA-200 though in every respect.  Switching to 8 ohm gets us this:I am puzzled that power output remains identical in both cases.  Something must be controlling that.The graph of distortion versus frequency at power levels is quite messy as it typically is:Putting aside the light pink which is at or near clipping, the amp if well behaved with only a modest rise in distortion as power levels increase.To keep things exciting , I added a new measurement to this test.  It is the \"dynamic\" power according to CEA-2006/490A designed to keep car audio amplifier companies honest with peak power:These are burst power measurements.  Let me know if you like them and I will run them in future reviews.  I think there is some merit to measuring this way as music is not continuous sine wave.ConclusionsNice to go back in time and test amplifiers which were simple to understand and simple to measure.  The NAD C 320BEE seems to have been competently designed for modest power delivery at a budget price.  In that regard, it completely succeeds in its mission.Personally, I think 67 watts is not enough for home listening.  Today's speakers have become smaller in size and shrunk in efficiency, needing fair bit of power to get them to produce proper dynamics.  If you disagree otherwise, or have sensitive speakers, the NAD C 320BEE seems to be a good unit to buy.  It certainly does away with any anxiety you may have with using class-D amplification.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.My wife is leaving town this weekend so I plan another big party again.

      " Yamaha WXA-50, multi-function DAC, pre-amp, power amp, streaming and multi-room unit.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Even though it came out a few years ago (2016?), it is widely available.  Amazon shows it costs US $478.Success of SONOS as a multi-room audio solution has been the envy of many traditional audio companies.  Many have tried to chase them with Yamaha being one of the earlier ones.The WXA-50 is a surprisingly heavy unit although looks somewhat unremarkable:The case is metal as best as I can tell which is good as the unit generates good bit of heat.  Strangely the heat is concentrated on the left side yet the vents are on the right!  There is an IR hole on the left which confused me to no end, constantly wanting to push it to turn on the unit.  I am not a fan of a single light indicating input and overload condition of the amplifier.  Worst part of the interface is the volume control which has no marking and no display.  Unless you use the app, you have no idea what volume you have set this to.  This made my testing maddeningly hard.I downloaded the App and here, I was pleasantly surprised by the performance and reliability of it.  With no configuration, the WXA-50 was recognized and manipulating its controls were instantaneous and reliable.  I only used the App to reset the EQ, etc. so for its full functionality, you should seek out other reviews.The back panel has extensive set of inputs and outputs although lacks USB:I was pleased to see both analog input and outputs.Yamaha heavily courted the Custom Install (CI) industry to use this instead of SONOS and it shows from inclusion of trigger input and output for control.  Inclusion of Toslink input goes along these lines to fetch audio from a TV being fed by HDMI.DAC Audio MeasurementsI briefly measured DAC performance.  I read however that there are two DAC chips inside this unit (an ESS and Bur-brown/TI) and that the fixed output is driven by the latter.  So this may not be representative of what happens when you stream music into this device:This is decent performance although it degraded fair bit if I turned up the volume on the amplifier to max.  That increased the higher order harmonics even though the output level of the DAC did not change.  We have seen this before and likely is the power supply sagging causing DAC performance to suffer.  SInce you don't listen at max volume level, I did not derate the WXA-50 performance when including it in the performance chart:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsSince we have analog inputs, I started my testing using that and got this for our usual dashboard at roughly 5 watts:I played around with combination of input levels and volume control and performance was pretty consistent.  SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) is actually quite respectable for an amplifier:I tested the same, this time using Roon to stream the 1 kHz tone to it using Airplay:We lose just a couple of dBs although distortion levels are a bit lower.From here on, I tested the unit using its analog input unless specified.Frequency response shows decent bandwidth and flat response in audible band:No strange and limiting digitization of input is visible which is good.Signal to noise ratio is good enough for 16 bit audio:Let's get into all important measurement: power into 4 ohm versus distortion:We are close to meeting the spec (I measure at much lower distortion than they do).  We have cleaner power than either Sonos or Amazon amps although the SONOS has much more power.Here is the performance at 8 ohm:I don't have as much data for 8 ohm but what is there, shows competent performance but with just 55 watts on tap.Intermodulation distortion versus power level tells a similar story:THD+N versus frequency and power shows very predictable performance with no corner cases exposed:Only 20 Hz tones gives it a bit of trouble with rising distortion above 10 watts but that is slight.The unit also shut down at 20 kHz at max clipping level. I reduced the volume level a few notches and that went away even though I was still pushing the unit into hard clipping.Spectrum of 1 kHz tone with no AES filter shows the usual noise in high frequencies we get from class-D amps:While this looks ugly, the spikes near audio band are way down at -75 dB which is very good.  I have tested amps where these levels are much, much higher.The two channels have different switching frequencies.  Not sure if this is on purpose or variation in the clock source of their modulators.  The two beat against each other likely creating the intermodulation spikes that we see throughout the range.ConclusionsUnlike the bag of parts performance I often see in these modern streaming products, the Yamaha WXA-50 seems to have benefited from some attention to raw performance of each subsystem.  There are no funny results, strange pipelines that go in and out of digital domain, etc.  The performance graphs are all smooth with no sudden jaggies or other anomalies.  This makes it easier to use the unit, not having to work around its weakness (I am talking to you SONOS).We also have decent amount of power, approaching 100 watts into 4 ohm which should be plenty.  If you add the subwoofer to it, you will be golden even at high SPLs.The app likewise, gives a feeling of polish that I often find lacking in competing products.In summary, I did not raise an eyebrow when measuring the Yamaha WXA-50.  It won't provide competition to state-of-the-art separate products but it also doesn't embarrass.  As such, I am going to put the WXA-50 on my recommended list.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.I was reading that the standard diet for panthers is large animals such as deer, antelope, etc.  I have not fed anything like that to my panthers and they are starting to mumble \"animal abuse\" under the lips.

      " PS Audio Stellar S300 Stereo Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The S300 costs US $1,499 from the company.Fitting the design language of the rest of the PS Audio and using similar enclosure, the S300 is quite hefty considering that it uses class-D amplification:There is just a power switch and light that indicates whether the unit is on, or has shut down due to protection circuit kicking in.The back panel shows very high quality and beefy connectors:As you see, there are redundant pairs of speaker sockets which I assume is an invitation to use bi-wiring.  Or feed the subwoofer using them as Paul McGowan advocates although a warning tells you to be careful as these are floating signals, not ground referenced.XLR inputs are nicely provided which I used for all of my testing.The internal amplification is provided by ICEpower 300AS1 modules.  These are integrated power supply and single channel amplifier modules.   PS Audio uses its own input buffer on these which they call \"Analog Cell.\"  This got the owner worried that it would measure poorly as did the PS Audio Stellar Gain Cell Preamplifier and DAC.  I must say it got me worried reading the description of it too:Seeing how the class-d module uses ample feedback to linearize its response, it is puzzling that he thinks the input stage should be without one.  Either feedback is good ro bad.  Can't have it both ways.Anyway, back to the operation of the unit, it ran cool and never got upset in my testing.  Overall, my subjective impression of the unit is positive.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs always, we start with 5 watt output into 4 ohm and see where we stand:Ah, that is respectable!  FFT spectrum just shows two distortion products with the second one at or below -100 dB.  There is however noise though which pushes the combination of those distortions and noise to -88 dB resulting in SINAD of same amount, only positive.  This puts the S300 amplifier above our median for all power amplifiers tested so far:Our frequency response is a bit variable at the high end:I looked up the 300AS1 response as shown in the inset and is consistent with that.  While most of us won't hear that rise in response, it does show load dependency which means each speaker will interact with it differently.All my tests use an AES-17 filter which has a flat response to 40 kHz and beyond.  But for the purposes of finding the actual high-bandwidth spectrum of the unit, I take it out for this test of 1 kHz tone at 5 watt:Switching frequency is around 450 kHz which is fine.  Typical of many of these class-d modules, the level is high at just -15 dB below signal. @DonH56 recently asked me if the level of switching noise tracks the signal itself so I decided to test for that by upping the power by a good bit to 180 watts and see what happens:As you see in blue, there is good news and bad news.  Good news is that the level doesn't scale with output power much.  Bad news is that its spectrum becomes quite wide so total energy may have increased that much.  Certainly scary to the eye but likely not to the ear.  Anyway, back to our regular programming, here is our signal to noise ratio:Not that good at 5 watt as we could have predicted from the SINAD in the dashboard.  At full power the situation improves but still not very competitive with top of the class switching amplifiers which can clock as high as 125 dB.  So be careful with sensitive speakers.Most important graph for amplifiers is power versus distortion+noise.  Here it is into 4 ohm:We have tons of good power to the tune of 256 watts.  Distortion starts to rise early though at just 10 watts.Here is the response into 8 ohm:Perhaps more revealing is what happens if we perform the same sweep but at different frequencies starting at 20 kHz and working our way down to 20 Hz.  An ideal amplifier would have all the graphs landing on top of each other.  But this is what we get here:At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the graphs indeed nicely land on top of each other (bottom group).  But at 5 kHz and higher, we get very odd responses indicating multiple non-linearities taking turn to dominate.  I thought this was an issue with PS Audio implementation but the same response is shown by ICEPower in their data sheet.Peak power shows disappointing level of headroom available for short durations as would be typical in music:The switching power supplies in class-d amplifiers are tightly regulated which means the power you get in steady-state, is what you get in peak.  Standard class AB amplifiers tend to have variable supply rails which if you don't tax much, will maintain higher voltage and produce more power in short bursts.  For this reason, you may want to get a more powerful class D amplifier to replace a class AB amp.ConclusionsIt is a sigh of relief that PS Audio had not managed to reduce the performance of the ICEPower modules.  Response and sonic abilities are completely determined by those modules unlike what PS Audio marketing says.  The ICEPower module used here has a distinctly lower performance than Hypex modules we have tested in the past. So you are not going to get state-of-the-art performance.  For that, you need to go to amplifiers higher in the SINAD graph.Still, this is a competent, well-built and well-supported amplifier based on proven amplification modules within.  Build quality is much higher than DIY or garage shop amplifiers using Hypex modules.  $1,500 is not a ton of money given these attributes.  For these reasons and good looks of the unit, I am going to put the PS Audio Stellar S300 amplifier on my recommended list.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.US tax season is upon us so I had to tabulate my expenses and donations for last year.

      " NAD 7050 integrated DAC, amplifier and streaming playback.  It is on kind loan from a member.  It appears the product was announced in 2014 and since discontinued as I can't find it on sale anywhere.  The cost was USD $999 from what I can gather.The unit can be used both horizontally and vertically.  A rotational sensor changes the display orientation conveniently.  Here is its upright position which I consider better for sound since the electrons can naturally free fall into the speaker terminals:The outside has what appears to be some sort of rubber glued to it.  It is soft to touch but picks up dirt very easily and is impossible to clean due to sticky nature of it.The large knobs imply great feel which they don't have.  They wobble as you rotate them.  The larger knob is the volume control which had an odd delay in updating the display as you rotated it.  Overall, a good effort has been made to create an unusual design but didn't quite get there in feel and functionality.The back panel shows off the inputs and speaker output:For my testing, I focused on USB input as I suspect that is the most common interface for consumers.  Alas, the USB interface is class one so only goes up to 96 kHz.  To get the advertised 192 kHz you need to use the other inputs.  I downloaded the NAD drivers which nicely gave me ASIO interface for testing.There is an app to control it and I downloaded it from Android play store.  It is a simple remote control but allowed me to change the audio-out to be full range so I could use it for DAC testing.  Otherwise it is filtered for subwoofer out.  Despite its simplicity the app crashed on me once.There is no analog input so I had do all of my testing with USB digital interface.As expected from a brand name company, the NAD 7050 comes with full set of safety and emissions regulatory certifications.The amplification in NAD 7050 apparently is a scaled down version of what is in NAD M2.  Here is what NAD says about it:My read is that it is a power DAC similar to Lyngdorf TDAI-3400 I reviewed recently.  Measurements will confirm if so.DAC MeasurementsAs usual, where possible I try to isolate the performance of the subsystems, in this case the DAC.  Here is our dashboard view using USB input/Line Out.  I hope you are sitting down if you owan the 7050 and use it as a DAC:What the heck is going on here?  Even at 0 dB the unit doesn't get to 2 volts yet it severely clips resulting all of those harmonic distortions.  Dialing down to -2 dBFS improved performance but just to 83 dB. By then the output voltage was even lower, making it not so useful as a DAC anyway.  My thinking is that this is a split off output from the power amplifier as opposed to a traditional DAC output.   I guess for the assumed subwoofer duty it may be OK.Naturally, with the SINAD as measured falls at the bottom of the graph of DACs tested:After the first bad impression, the 7050 almost nails the rest of the measurements such as linearity:And jitter:Since USB doesn't support 192 kHz, I had to run a different multi-tone test at 44.1 kHz:Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual, the dashboard view is at 5 watts of power into 4 ohm:As power amplifier measurements go, this is not too bad actually and almost matches the vaguely stated 90 dB spec by NAD.Power versus distortion+noise is also pretty decent:The downward part of the curve is always dominate by noise as the output level is low.  Here, that part of the curve is flatter than I am used to seeing which is good as far as level of noise.  Likewise, distortion is kept under complete control until onset of sudden and massive clipping at 54 watts.  This too is good (sans the clipping).  Stated rating is 50 watts at 4 ohm and we beating that a bit which is nice.  Then again, 50 watts is not that much power in grand scheme of things.THD+N versus frequency using my default 45 kHz bandwidth shows pretty awful results (in red):Suspecting ultrasonic noise at play, I re-ran the test with 22.4 kHz (as with the dashboard) in blue which shows that effect quite conclusively.  One channel is worse than the other though which is strange.  Note that the drop above a few Khz is due to bandwidth of the test being too low to capture all the harmonics (and hence the reason I like to use 45 kHz bandwidth normally).Broadband FFT shows of 1 kHz tone shows us what is going on:This is without my Audio Precision high-frequency filter (AUX-0040).  All the other tests used that filter.On the extreme left we see our 1 kHz tone as a spike rising to 0 dB or so.  We have a single and large spike at 850 kHz.  That seems to indicate to me that 850 kHz may be the switching frequency.  Given its high frequency, the power DAC is running likely with as a single bit converter which would create a lot of quantization noise.  Noise shaping is used to push that above 30 kHz or so with the peak at about 80 kHz.  This is the drawback of power DACs as we have seen in the Lyngdorf and SONOS Amp versus class D amplification which doesn't need noise shaping.  You can see the effect of high frequency noise in the thickened sine wave of the same signal in the inset.ConclusionsUsually, by the time I get to the end of testing, I have a good idea of if I like or don't like a device.  Here, I am not quite sure.  Let's agree that no one should be using the NAD 7050 as a DAC with external amplification as NAD suggests in the manual.  You will be listening to a heap of distortion products with anemic output to boot.The amplifier seems to have some good tricks under its sleeves with lower than normal noise and very controlled distortion until a very hard limit.  My issue there is the 50 watt rating for a $1000 device.  That is just not enough power for a product in this category.Seeing how the NAD 7050 is discontinued, maybe it doesn't need my recommendation or lack thereof anyway.  So I will leave it at that.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Money was donated for gas to go and get some good fish chips in town.

      " Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $89.99 with stock 32 volt supply.  Price goes up to $109.99 with the 48 volt supply.  There is a $10 discount coupon right now.Despite its budget price, the V3 manages to look elegant with the hole pattern on top and large and smooth feeling Volume/On/Off control. Power supply is external and as noted, you get a choice:As you will see later, you really want the 48 volt version:Yes, it is a larger supply but you are going to hide it behind your desk anyway so might as well live the good life with the increased power there.  The amplifier is based on TI TPA3255 class D amplifier IC.  There are replaceable op-amps for those of you who have nothing better to do than mess with the design.When I took the amplifier out of the package, I noticed something rattling in there.  Fearing the worst, I took the unit apart. Turns out one of the two large power supply caps had lost its adhesion to the PCB. The putty used is to keep the cap glued to the PCB was too flexible and had broken loose. No harm though as the cap is laying on its side and can't go anywhere. The sound I was hearing was it moving just a hair up and down and hitting the top of the case.  Suggest company use a different material to fix this.I will post the pictures of the insides later.  For now, a large aluminum couples the amplifier IC to the case. There is no thermal grease but the amp ran cool enough that I don't think you need to worry about it. But if you are, this you can remedy yourself.  Despite me pushing the amp to max power repeatedly, it just got warm to touch.  The protection circuit was the best kind with high tolerance of clipping and audio-restart.Fosi Audio V3 Amplifier MeasurementsI performed the low power tests using the 32 volt supply.  The rest is done with both.  So let's start with our usual dashboard:Distortion is nicely kept to -100 dB so we are noise limited causing SINAD to land around 88 dB.  This is well above average for all amplifiers tested:Notice how many amplifiers it beats to the right of it!Noise performance is also quite good for the class, almost clearing the hurdle for 16 bit content at just 5 watts:Frequency response shows load dependency which all class D amplifiers in this price range show:In English, this means that depending on which speaker you use, the sound may be a bit bright or a bit dull if your hearing extends to 20 kHz.  You can counter with EQ (which you better have for good sound in your room).Multitone and 19+20 kHz show good performance for the class:Edit: forgot to post crosstalk measurement:Let's see how much power we can get out of this little box into 4 ohm:You normally wouldn't expect to get more power with a 48 volt supply compared to 32 volt when their current ratings are the same.  But as I noted in the picture at the start, the larger power supply is conservatively rated and is able to pump out more current for peaks.  We can see this in our short-term power measurements:With 8 ohm volt, we are more in need of voltage so naturally we get tons more there as well with the 48 volt supply:Transfer function is quite good for class D and I was especially impressed with its ability to pump out same power at high frequencies as many amplifiers go into protection there:There is some pop noise when turning on and off but it is very mild:The amplifier is stable on power up:Some of you have been aiming at creating more work for me by asking for for efficiency tests. I developed a test that is semi-automatic and provides reasonable accuracy (within 5%):Note that part of the heat is dissipated in the power supply and part in the amp.  The X axis is power per channel, not total (amp is driven in stereo).Edit: here are the teardown pictures:ConclusionsState of the art DACs run on highly performant silicon that when well implemented, produces the best performance we have seen.  We are seeing similar development with these class D IC amplifiers.  Noise and distortion is quite low and beats many amplifiers in the market.  They bring two drawbacks: external power supplies and load dependencies.  If the latter is resolved, these amplifiers would obsolete large segment of the audio market!The Fosi Audio V3 is well implemented and brings nice looks and design at a bargain price.  Company is also quite receptive to customer input and is a delight to work with behind the scenes.  I don't know what else we could ask for!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier.EDIT: a few pages in the thread claim was made that the input buffer opamp must be fake as they don't look like the official TI chip packaging.  Company chimed in a couple of days later saying they bought the ICs directly from TI.  And showed the purchase order proving the same.  It seems the \"internet got this wrong\" as far as what constitutes a fake as TI is using two different factories with different packaging.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Denon PMA-50 Audio (speaker) amplifier with included DAC and Bluetooth.  It is on kind loan from a member. It seems to be discontinued but when available, it cost US $599.  I see it on ebay and such from $370 to $450.The enclosure is more stout and nicer looking/feeling than a lot of products in this category:The volume control is large and nice feeling.  It works a bit odd though in that when you first turn it, it switches the display to volume level but doesn't do anything with respect to changing the level.  You need to keep turning it to have it take effect.There is a headphone amp which I did not test yet.  May do that later.Back panel shows a nice suite of digital and analog inputs but no line out for the DAC:I performed all of my testing with USB and a bit with analog Aux input.Included mains power supply gets rid of the tangle of wires that comes with external supplies.Internally this is a \"DDFA\" design which means it accepts digital input and converts it to PWM for amplification. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI started my initial test with USB input to the amplifier and got this:While not state-of-the-art, performance is above average for amplifiers we have tested with respect to distortion:Using analog input degrades performance fair bit:We lose about 5 dB, mostly in elevated noise level.  Note the channel mismatch when you use analog input as opposed to digital.Frequency response using USB input and high sample rate of 192 kHz, shows the noise shaping/filtering of the digital amplifier:Young people with good hearing may hear some elevated sharpness.  Total bandwidth though is better than some other amps we have tested which truncate at 22 kHz and such.Looking at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone, we see a very well behaved amplifier despite being class-D:Ultrasonic noise is limited to -60 dB.  Some other products have peaks as high as -20 dB here.  There is a single spike at 840 kHz or so, which is likely the switching frequency.Note that I did not have to use my AES filter as I usually do with class D amp.  The analyzer was not confused by the ultrasonic noise as present.Using USB input we get very clean signal until the amp stops producing power:54 watts of power slightly beats the 50 watt specification into 4 ohm.  Alas, this is not much power, relegating the unit to office, small room use.As expected, power drops with 8 ohm load:I suggest getting a 4 ohm speaker to extract the max power out of the unit.Using analog input, we can compare the power at 4 ohm to other amps tested.  Here again, the gain was strange as turning it up to 0 dB, caused elevated noise and very early clipping.  So I dialed volume down and drove the unit to 2 volt input to get this:As we see, its modern competitors all have tons more power.The digital input though does better as we see in this IMD comparison:If the PMA-50 had more power, it would be a real contender here.Signal to noise ratio using USB input at nearly 5 watts and max power yielded this:We barely miss the spec at max power.  Even at 5 watt though, we are reasonably close to noise floor of CD/16-bit audio.  So not bad.ConclusionsThe Denon PMA-50 seems to be competently designed.  It has none of the performance quirks of cheap class-D amps.  It has a solid cabinet and controls to go with that engineering.The big knock against it is modest amount of power and high price relative to competition.  And in this day and age, lack of streaming support.I personally put huge value on power in amplifiers so can't recommend the PMA-50 on that front.  But you have the data and can judge for yourself with your priorities.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.The weather has warmed up and we are having a glorious, dry spring which is unusual for us.  The panthers have noticed the same and have been pestering me for a picnic lunch.  They may seem small in pictures but they have voracious appetite so I need money for food and drinks for them.

      " Marantz PM-90 Vintage stereo integrated amplifier.  It was purchased by a member from japan and drop shipped to me for testing.  It came out in 1991 with a price of 160,000 Yen (about $1,500 in today's exchange rate).  I looked online and I can only find one for US $950 but it is more beat up than this unit.I must say, this is one nice looking amplifier with a look that would fit in even today:The feel of the controls is excellent other than volume control which I found a bit loose.  A flip down door gives you additional control including switching between Class AB and Class A mode of operation!  Sadly it requires the unit to be powered down to change so no opportunity for instant switching and comparison.I was pleasantly surprised to see modern, beefy speaker terminals as well:Even more interesting is the inclusion of XLR balanced inputs for CD.This amplifier is back breakingly heavy due to use of two massive transformers.  It is at the limit of what I could lift and carry up two flight of stairs for testing.  Sitting here, my back aches just thinking about the reverse trip to pack the darn thing!  Speaking of packing, it was immaculately double boxed by Hifi-Do with zero impact to it despite the long journey.  Apparently it even came with one year warranty although you have to ship it back to Japan for that.Speaking of Japan, the unit is made for that market and hence 100 volt rating as opposed to 120 volts we have here in US.  If it were mine, I would go ahead and use it at 120 but being that of someone else's and hard to replace, I powered it by both my Lab AC generator and a Variac set to 100 volts.  This may have caused some measurement issues as I noted below.Marantz PM-90 Amplifier MeasurementsThere is a lot here to test due to dual mode of operation and dual type of input.  Let's start with Class A operation with RCA and then XLR:Unfortunately our measurements are polluted by high mains noise and harmonics.  I tried every which way but could not reduce that impact much.  Whether this is due design of the amplifier or longer AC mains connection due to use of lab AC gen or Variac, I can't tell.  As is SINAD doesn't appear to be better than modern AVRs with Marantz on their front plate:However, if we look at the FFT, we see only two harmonics and then it disappears into noise.  Here is the performance of Marantz SR7015 as a reference:Noise from power supply is lower there which aids it in getting similar SINAD.Switching to Class AB mode has no penalty:If anything distortion harmonics go a bit lower although that was not reliable.To see if there is a difference at all between Class AB and Class A, I turned on the residual mode of Audio Precision in the scope display.  This shows us the difference between input and output waveforms.  If there is zero crossing error due to class AB operation, we should see more difference around that part of the waveform but we don't:What is there is mostly power supply noise.  I changed frequencies, power level down to 1 watt and still saw nothing that would correlate with zero crossing distortion which class A is supposed to solve.  Feedback and class AB operation seem to have cured that ailment leaving little room for Class A to do better.Here is the comparison between Class AB and Class A again with respect to signal to noise ratio:Class AB pulls ahead in full power mode because it can create more power.  At baseline 5 watts they are similar likely limited by power supply noise.Crosstalk showed a tiny improvement in favor of class A but it is not material:Bandwidth is good but not exceptional:Notice how amplifier gain changes as you switch modes so for any listening tests, you may have to compensate for that.Class AB of course has tons more power:Overall shape of the graph is average.  Wanting to see the impact of the pre-amp vs power amp, I separated the two and fed the unit with my analyzer direct using RCA:As expected, my analyzer is cleaner but impact is on distortion, not noise which is a bit surprising.  As is one channel being worse than the other.   SINAD reaches almost 100 dB now near full power, good channel, which is very nice.There is a lot of headroom when using class AB vs Class A:Testing amplifier linearity vs frequency we get:Class A power limits more at 20 Hz than Class AB.  Both show very predictable and smooth responses which is great.Multitone tests shows slightly lower distortion at higher frequencies in favor of Class A:Effectiveness of feedback lowers at higher frequencies and likely this is the reason class A does better there.Marantz PM-90 Phono Input MeasurementsIt was hard to figure out a fair way to measure the performance of its phono stage to compare to stand-alone devices.  At first I used tape output but that didn't produce great response.  Best was from pre-amp tap to power amp:Sadly the mains noise is there and dwarfs SINAD.  There is no sign of harmonic distortion so that is very good.  Same situation exists for MC mode:RIAA equalization is probably the best I have measured:That story continues into headroom measurements:You get almost 12 volts of output before it starts to clip!  So pops and clicks should be much less noticeable.ConclusionsThe PM-90 does NOT show its age.  It produces above average performance compared to today's amplifiers.  It does so while running very cool and comfortable.  Not once did it get warm to touch or go into protection.  Push it hard and it just pulls back on the output but keeps going.  Clearly this is a very robust implementation.  Can it compete with state of the art amplification today in the form of Benchmark THX and Hypex/Purifi Class D amps?  No.  There is real innovation there to push down distortion and noise.  But we also have a lot of terrible amplifiers today which the PM-90 easily outperforms and does it with so much style.There is nothing to apologize for and a lot to praise for Marantz PM-90.  I hope the company goes back to these roots rather than horrible looks and performance of much of their AV line.On class A mode, I see no reason to recommend it and many reasons to avoid it.  If you run out of power there, you will certainly create audible distortion.  Whereas any benefit it might have is literally lost in the noise.I am happy to recommend the Marantz PM-90.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " XTZ A2-300 class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $500 from the company direct (which is located in Europe).  It is based on B&O ICE 300ASC or its newer name, 300A1.While you won't mistake the enclosure for A2-300 as a high-end, custom design, it has enough extra touches to set it above typical DIY type cases:There are some nice looking vents on the side.   Note however that all the heat is centralized in the center bottom panel as is typical of class D amp modules.  In use though, the bottom barely got warm although I could smell heat generation through side vents.I was disappointed to not see balanced inputs:The gain potentiometer will make the unit flexible but they are typically not good for reliability.  Since these controls don't get used often, then tend to go bad.  If you buy this unit, be sure to turn the control left and right once a few months.Binding posts are substantial which I liked.XTZ A2-300 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm:As noted, I adjusted the gain control to give me roughly 29 dB which is the standard value I use for my testing (and matches the THX recommendations).  Distortion is fairly low at -98 dB or so but there is enough noise to cost you 10 dB and a bit more in the other channel.  This makes SINAD still above average:As noted, noise is somewhat an issue and we can see that in signal to noise ratio:Notice how one channel is 3.5 dB worse than the other.I was a bit disappointed to see frequency response being impacted by my simple resistive load, showing peaking around 20 kHz:More complex speaker loads may make this worse (or better).  Crosstalk is OK:Here is our power level versus distortion+noise at 4 ohm:We see the same noise differential here and some distortion differential as well (although the latter is somewhat common).  Power is way short of 300 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% which is what the spec calls for, we are still shy of that:So definitely not conservatively rated.8 ohm load naturally produces a lot less power:Typical of ICE modules, they don't behave evenly across the frequency range:That is quite a variation in distortion and noise relative to power.  In some sense then our previous tests using 1 kHz are not as representative of the total performance.ConclusionsI started the review liking the enclosure.  But then got a bit more jaded with unbalanced only inputs, and higher than expected noise level, high frequency dependency on both frequency response and distortion+noise. Then again, performance is still above average compared to many amplifiers I have tested.  This produced a quandary for me.  I could recommend it and justify it.   At the end, I decided to not recommend it but without strong feelings one way or the other.  You have the data to decide for yourself.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " NAD C268 power amplifier with balanced inputs.  It is kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $900 at NAD dealers (not Amazon, etc.).  The C268 is built on Hypex UcD Class D amplifier modules so in testing it we will get coverage on that as well.  Then again NAD says it is a custom version for them.The front panel looks good and substantial:The unit is nice and light to move around and inside has fair amount of space.  Back panel is nice in the way it provides both balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA input together with gain control:For my testing I used the fixed gain mode to get around any channel differential the potentiometers may introduce.Speaker terminals are nice and easy to use and naturally the unit is properly certified for safety and emissions.  Keep the later in mind as you compare it with any DIY version of the same amplifier modules.  With anything with mains input, I highly recommend sticking with products with safety certifications.In use, the amplifier runs completely cool to touch.  Not even above room temperature it seems.  It never, ever shut down no matter what I did to it.  This is one of the reasons you buy a separate amplifier by the way.  These power amplifiers are far more robust than any in any home theater AVR.Stereo Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard where we feed the amplifier a simple 1 kHz sine wave/tone and ask it to produce 5 watts into 4 ohm load (typical for many speakers).  This is what we get:For some reason the channel in blue has much more second harmonic causing its SINAD -- which is a sum of distortion and noise -- to suffer by 5 dB.  There is always some differential between stereo channels but this is a bit much.  This aside, performance is above average with a SINAD of 87 dB once averaged (click on graph for larger size):Covering the basics, frequency response is very good:Crosstalk (one channel bleeding from one to the other) shape is unusual but fortunately it gives is near state-of-the-art performance where our hearing (more or less) is most sensitive:Noise performance is very good (much better than its distortion metric):You easily clear the CD/streaming content's 16 bit dynamic range at almost any listening level.Getting fancy and using 32-tones to test for distortion/intermodulation we get what we already seen from the dashboard which is good:A power amplifier's job is well, to produce power so let's measure that starting with 4 ohm load:NAD rates the amplifier at 80 watts for both 4 and 8 ohm loads which is unusual.  Fortunately we are beating that with our 4 ohm load, getting 96 watts.As noted earlier, noise performance is very good as indicated by how low the red graphs are until distortion sets in and the graph starts to flatten and rise.  But then we hit a very hard wall at the end.  This is an amp that will sound good until it doesn't.  You will instantly know its power limit for good or bad.There is some hidden good news here though.  Let's measure power at 1% distortion+noise both continuous (like above) and burst:Wow, many switching amplifiers don't produce much more power in burst mode.  Here, we are getting more than double the power to the tune of 230 watts while both channels driven!  This means for momentary musical peaks, you have much more power available than our standard non-burst tests show.Switching to 8 ohms we get what the company advertises:All of these power tests are at just one frequency: 1 kHz.  Let's now run the same power sweep into 4 ohm load but vary the frequency:With class D amps, I expect these lines to have many different shapes and be all of the place.  Instead, they land right on top of each other which is an ideal response.  If you look to the right before clipping occurs though, you see that at the two ends of the spectrum -- 20 and 20,000 Hz -- power does get limited.  20 kHz doesn't need much power as music spectrum is quite low.  But 20 Hz does and loss of power is unfortunate but very common.  The peaks at low frequencies last a while due to their slow \"speed\" (rate of change) which taxes the power supply causing it to run out of juice at lower power levels.Amplifier Bridged Mode PerformanceI usually don't test bridged mode but knowing you rascals, you will immediately ask for it since NAD emphasizes this a lot.  So let's reconfigure the amp into a single channel and see what we get:Company advertises 300 watts but that is likely at higher distortion than what I use in the above graph.  To approximate their performance, let's use the 1% THD+N threshold again and measure again:Now we get the 300 watts continuous.  And better yet, we get close to half a kilowatt of power for peaks!  Nicely done.ConclusionsThe value proposition of the NAD C268 amplifier doesn't look very good at first blush.  Just 80 watts per channel for $900?  Testing shows while that is more or less the continuous power level, for short duration the amplifier can provide far more power.  Combined with the nice and safe build quality, the C268 won my heart.As such, I am going to put the NAD C268 on my recommended list.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I keep asking for money from you all to get rid of depression that sets in me when I don't receive cash all the time.

      " NAD M10 streaming amplifier and DAC.  It was purchased and drop shipped to me kindly by a member.  It costs US $2,749 from NAD dealers.The M10 sports a very large touch screen LCD display that covers the entire front face:Sorry for leaving the protecting plastic on.  Like to keep things as new as possible for members.As nice as the display is, it simply is not as responsive as your phone or tablet.  What could be really cool such as the VU meter mode, becomes a jittery display that doesn't please much.  A much faster processor with GPU would be needed to really make the display the star.  Still, it is heads and shoulders above others that have small displays.The back panel is notable for inclusion of HDMI ARC input:Alas, I have no ARC capability on my workstation so could not test that feature.In normal use the plastic case barely gets warm.  Under heavy stress of power testing, it got somewhat warm making me wish the case was made out of aluminum than plastic.  You are not likely to push the switching amplifiers this hard and at any rate, the M10 runs much cooler than any Audio/Video Receiver.While I did not have time to test it, the M10 comes with Dirac Room EQ which is nice.I noticed one operational/design issue.  I unplugged the unit to take its picture but noticed that the display went crazy flashing random stuff.  I thought it was a capacitor that was discharging but this continued and would not stop!  I looked in the back and I realized I still had the HDMI cable plugged in.  Knowing that it provides a 5 volt \"hot plug\" signal, I disconnected it and the display finally shut down.  This is improper design.  The device must NOT draw any power out of HDMI connection.DAC Audio MeasurementsI connected the Coax output of my Audio Precision APx555 analyzer to the M10 and measured what came out of the pre-out with volume adjusted for 2 volt output:Distortion is quite low at -110 dB (near threshold of hearing) but the noise floor kept jumping up and down causing SINAD to vary with it.  This shows lack of isolation between sensitive DAC subsystem and busy processor running other functions of the device.  As it is, performance is respectable which is a sigh of relief:Anything in green and blue is good.Testing at other output levels shows that the M10 is capable of pumping out good bit of voltage:Dynamic range clears the bar for 16 bit CD/streaming content but not much more:IMD distortion versus level shows the same noise issue:Filter response also shows higher than it should be noise floor:Jitter and noise test shows a lot of unwanted tones but audibly they are below threshold of hearing:Linearity is very good:EDIT: forgot to include multitone in the original review:Finally, we see the penalty of the DAC filter not being sharp enough in distortion+noise versus frequency:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI was hoping that analog input was not digitized but alas, it is:And at very low sample rate.  Maybe there is a setting to change this but I did not bother to look.Using the same analog input, I witnessed wild swings in noise floor of the unit:So I abandoned the analog input and switched to Coax for the rest of the amplifier tests:Performance is improved and stable as well.  This rates the M10 above average for more than 100 amplifiers tested so far:Signal to noise ratio is disappointing as even with full power, it barely clears the 16 bit hurdle:Frequency response using digital input is wide enough:But for those people with ultra sensitive high frequency hearing, you will lose half a dB at 20 kHz.Let's see how much clean power we get out of M10 starting with 4 ohm load:I allowed the distortion to go higher (1%) and got even more power:I tried to get the burst power rating but some kind of limiter in the M10 was fighting the analyzer and wouldn't allow me to get there.  It was nice that it would not shut down.Power naturally drops at 8 ohm:ConclusionsPerformance of the NAD M10 is generally acceptable especially for a multifunction device where we see a lot of fails.  Alas issues here and there took away my enthusiasm for it.  There is no excuse for poor analog input performance in a nearly $3000 device.  Or rather high and variable noise floor.So overall, I gave it a \"like it\" panther award but it is not something I would personally buy.  I can be stubborn that way!-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.So stressed out with the terrible backlog of reviews, I have nothing sarcastic to say.

      " Teac AX-501 integrated power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The AX-501 is part of the reference series from Teac so doesn't come cheap as desktop products go.  I see the price at USD $999 on Amazon plus $35 shipping.  There is a discount for silver a USD $899 but Amazon doesn't sell it for some reason.When I reviewed the Teac HA-501 Headphone Amplifier, I heaped praise over its modern retro look.  The AX-501 takes that to an entirely different level with addition of a couple of super cute, yellow background VU meters:What is that?  I should have took the shot with the VU meters working and the light turned on?  Well, the owner played a cruel joke on me by not supplying me with the remote and leaving the setting to off for the VU meter!!!  The controls are almost as nice of the HA-501 with the exception of the volume control which feels a bit stiff and has some slack in it.  Otherwise, there is nothing to fault it as far as I am concerned.Here is the back panel:XLR inputs should be mandatory in this price range and I am glad to see then included here (that is the way I ran all of my tests).  The AX-501 uses a class-D amplifier and runs as cool as you could get in my testing.  I don't think it ever got even warm.  Class D also means light weight and that is NOT the case here. The AX-501 is a very hefty unit for its size.  This means it stays put no matter how heavy your cables are.Notice the lawyers getting their hands on the unit as to indicate the class of speaker wiring you are supposed to use!  But hey, it is good to know the unit has been through corporate filter of certification and regulation.Even though Teac is a Japanese company, the AX-501 is made in China.Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our usual 5 watt dashboard view using XLR inputs:Even though Teac specs the AX-501 at 1 watt, we see the same performance at 5 watts which is nice. Distortion and noise as stated in SINAD dB puts the AX-501 above average (of 74 dB):It loses to SONOS Amp using its digital input and ever so slightly outperforms the Amazon Link Amp.Signal to noise ratio matches company spec:Frequency response shows identical output for both channels which is a relief as poorly made class-D amps differ in this regard:Roll off is early for my taste.  I like to see flat response to 40  kHz. That said, early filtering seems to help bring stability to performance of the low cost class D amps and I saw that here as I measured power output:There is a broad operating range where performance is good between 1 and 30 watts.  We then run out of juice and clipping occurs at 88 watts.  Rated output is 100 watts although higher resolution measurement may have gotten us closer.The Amazon Link Amp has more power and SONOS even more.  You are guaranteed to hear distortion when an amp reaches its max power rating so on this all important metric, the Teac AX-501 loses to its cheaper rivals.  And of course we are worlds away compared to reference amps like those based on Hypex NC-400.I have added a new test to my power amplifier suite and that is intermodulation distortion relative to measured power.  I ran it against the recently reviewed Klipsch PowerGate Amplifier: We see more evidence of the stability and clean performance of Teac AX-501 as switched/class D amplifiers go.  The IMD graph is also more revealing of distortion set it around 7 to 8 watts and climbing before final clipping.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI ran a sampling of my headphone tests starting with power versus distortion using 300 ohm load:Wow, this is impressive amount of output power at such a high impedance.  I wonder if we are just looking at the output of the power amplifier, reduced with an in-line resistor.  Here is the results with 33 ohm load:Oh, this is not nearly as good.  The reason is this:Sadly, we have a high value resistor in series with the output to the tune of 58 ohm.  I don't like to see a value much more than 10 ohm and ideally, down to 1 to 2 ohm.Best use would be high impedance headphone with relatively flat impedance graph versus frequency.  Otherwise some \"color\" will be imparted on the sound (for good or bad).ConclusionsPersonally I think Teac has nailed the look and feel of such a desktop product.  The AX-501 is in an entirely different class, rivalling Nagra when it comes to switch-gear and meters.  In that regard it is a \"bargain.\"The power amplifier seems competent without hairy corner cases.  It is above average in performance but not rising up to the levels I like to see for $1,000.  As I noted in the review. power is everything and there are much better choices in that regard such as SONOS Amp.  At nearly half the price, it delivers more than twice the power plus a bunch of other features such as included streaming/DAC.  It doesn't look nearly as nice as Teac AX-501 though.The headphone output is a checklist item although it should sound very good with high impedance headphones (I did not test).The AX-501 runs cool and should be quite reliable and safe giving its pedigree.  Overall I 'like\" the Teac AX-501 but can't recommend it on performance or value.  We should be able to do better for $1,000 so the search continues.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Major issue: my pink panther models have given me notice that they like to go on strike if I don't increase their pay.

      " Lexicon, first generation DD8, 8-channel amplifier.  It was purchased used by a member and drop shipped to me.  The DD8 came from collaboration of Harman with TI (chip company) to produce very low weight, switching amplifiers for BMW car audio system.  It was then later repurposed in this configuration for the Custom Integration (CI) industry.  It is actually rebranded by a number of companies and sold under their label. Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman products which includes Lexicon.  So keep potential bias in mind as you read this review.All 8 channels are provided in one compact, very cool running 1U rack mount chassis:A stout on off switch manages power duties together with heftiest relay sound you have heard!  The back will seem unusual for hi-fi market but is precisely what the custom integration channel needs:You can either feed the unit individually per channel or a \"bus\" input that feeds the same stereo input to all the channels.  The latter is very handy for \"whole house audio\" where the same music plays in every room from ceiling speakers and such.  A looped bus output is provided to cascade more of these units.Output is provided through phoenix connectors which again is common and desired in CI channel as they are secure but small connectors.  Individual gain controls are provided for every channel.  You can also select mono vs stereo (again, useful in whole house audio where you usually want mono).  And auto-sensing for channels not used.  Trigger is also provided of course.The available units are pulled out of existing installs so likely have many hours on them.  And if the installer didn't know what he was doing, it may have been subjected to high temps.  Indeed the first unit the owner bought did not work right, changing its gain with temperature.  I traced it to the front-end of the unit.  So know what you are getting if you buy them used.Brand new, second generation DD8s cost US $3,500 (through dealer channels). This version listed for US $2,500.  I see them listed for $1,300 right now on ebay but I believe the owner was able to get it much cheaper.Lexicon DD8 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard.  I set the gain to max which nicely gave me 29 dB which is what I have standardized on:This is above average performance with distortion kept below 100 dB;Noise performance is good as well:Ideally we would get 16 bits at 5 watts but 15 is a good effort.I was disappointed by the early cut off from the output filter:This is due to rather low switching frequency of 250 kHz (common values are in 300 to 400 kHz), which made the filter harder to design:Crosstalk is fine:Power into 4 ohm is rather low:The protection circuit was aggressive which made getting max and peak power difficult.  Still I managed to get some numbers:While we get more burst power courtesy of power supply designed for a lot more channels than two, max power with 1% THD+N still was rather low.I then tested the amp using 8 ohm and surprisingly, it produces more power there:To see how the power scales, I measured max power using two and four channels.  Both were the same using 8 ohm:Most disappointing was varying the frequency and producing a power sweep:As you see, there is huge penalty at higher frequencies.  Furthermore, there are power related linearities.ConclusionsIn mid to low frequencies, the DD8 produces well above average performance.  Above that frequency though, distortion increases substantially and other non-linearities surface.  Output seems to have some load dependency while also rolling off early.If you can get the unit for a few hundred dollars, then its compact enclosure and general performance may be a steal.  You could almost push me to recommend it but I am not going to.  I like to see better performance with respect to frequency response and high frequencies.   I think for its intended custom install market, it is perfect (our company has installed a lot of these).  For hi-fi use, you have to make that decision.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Outlaw 2200 single-channel amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 2200 costs US $399 plus shipping although I read that it goes on sale for less than that.I was surprised how svelte the 2200 is given its power capability:The diminutive size comes from \"class G\" implementation which varies the power supply with signal.  This sharply lowers the power loss at lower power levels allowing the heatsinks to be much smaller.   Despite its low \"1U\" height, the 2200 is heavy though courtesy of a larger pancake toroidal power transformer.It is always great to see balanced XLR input and trigger capability on amplifiers:In use, the 2200 was solid as a rock.  It never shut down or complain and ran very cool even after full suite of tests.  I was worried about recommendation to stack these from Outlaw but after testing, I think that can be done without much concern.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:SINAD is supposed to be sum of distortion and noise relative to our input signal.  Here, distortion is very low, approaching -105 dB.  So the fact that the SINAD is just 86 dB tells us that the number is dominated by noise as you will see shortly.  As it is, this is above average for some 75 amplifiers tested so far:Here is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and full power:Frequency response is a bit more limited than I like to see:Measured power at both 4 and 8 ohms exceed outlaw specifications:Even more power is on tap if you allow higher distortion or for momentary peaks:Wideband spectrum analysis shows very clean output:Those of you who are bothered by class D switching noise, should be happy to see this.  Indeed I performed all of my tests without an ultrasonic filter on my Analyzer.Thermal StabilityPerformance was rock solid from cold to operating temp:ConclusionsThe Outlaw 2200 monoblocks provides solid performance, easily besting the amps you get in a typical home theater AVR and then some.  Its slim packaging allows you to configure as many channels as you need without needing a lot of space.  Efficiency is good but doesn't bring with it the light weight of the class D.  I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2200 amplifier.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Freezing in the garage measuring speakers.

      " Niles SI-2150 Class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  He purchased it refurbished and I see it for sale at $367.  Original cost seems to be US $850.By using efficient Hypex UcD250LP class D amplifier modules, the SI-2150 manages to fit in a small, 1U rack chassis:Niles is targeting this amp as Custom Integration (CI) channel so has good control as far as trigger and such:In use, the unit stayed cool and calm.  When pushed into clipping it will go into protection.  Sadly it stays in that mode until it is power cycled rather than recovering on its own.Nice set of gain controls are provided which lets you get precise channel matching -- something that is rarely the case in many amplifiers.  I set them to 29 dB for my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone dashboard into 4 ohm load:SINAD which is the ratio of distortion and noise versus signal is better than average at 85 dB:Signal to noise ratio ranks in the same region:Frequency response is flat enough in audible band:Power into 4 ohm shows good noise and distortion:Lots of power is available if we allow the distortion to rise to 1%:Response into 8 ohm load is rather odd:Usually we have a declining graph with hard clipping in solid state amplifiers, not this gradual rise in distortion.  As such, it was not easy to determine the clipping point as I normally do.Typical of class D amps, the relationship with frequency and power is complex:Removing my ultrasonic filter allows us to see the switching spectrum of the amplifier:ConclusionsI am not sure at the regular list price but at refurbished cost, this is a steal of an amplifier.  Lots of power in a cool, small enclosure with above average distortion and noise.I am going to put the Niles SI-2150 on my recommended list.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Don't have an ounce of creativity at the moment to tell you anything sarcastic.

      " Peachtree amp500 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,499.The amp500 comes in the same packaging of many previous Peachtree products. I wish company would innovate here as the design looks kind of dated. Then again it is very unique.  This amplifier comes with balanced inputs which I very much like:When I pushed the amp, the protection circuit naturally kicked it but unlike many other amps, recovered automatically without the need for a power cycle.The back half of the box is empty so the amp module is small.  And there is plenty of ventilation on top.  There was only modest temperature rise in the case post all the testing I did which is admirable.Peachtree amp500 MeasurementsThe amplifier was ready on power up:Dashboard measurement shows above average performance:Noise+distortion as embodied in SINAD is well above median although well sort of state of the art:I could not come close to matching company spec for SNR:Frequency response was flat enough and not dependent on impedance which is very good for a class D amp:Crosstalk was state of the art so I am assuming some kind of dual mono configuration:Multitone was respectable:Let's see how power it pumps into a 500 watt load:That is a lot of power!  The clipping is quite sharp though which when combined with the protection circuit, would not allow me to measure max power.  But I did get peak power:I think spec is 700 watts but we are close enough.  Even at 8 ohm we have good bit of power:High frequencies bother the amp but go lower and linearity is excellent:Finally, we have a new test: power on noise:I haven't run this test on other amps to know if this is good or bad.  Once I do get some mileage on it, we will better know what is going on.  If I were to guess, I would say this is good performance.ConclusionsStory here is simple: tons and tons of power with above average noise and distortion.  A cool running switching amplifier in small package as well.  Really, nothing much to complain about here.I am going to recommend the Peachtree amp500.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Outlaw 2220 single channel amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $399.The look is simple but elegant in its slim form factor.  I like that it is just heavy enough to give you confidence but not so much that you can't lift it.Nice set of features are provided from balanced XLR input to trigger.  A larger toroidal transformer indicates class class AB design (not switching).Outlaw 2220 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm:I like the very low distortion spikes that are around -108 dB or so.  Some power supply noise (120 Hz) and general noise lower SINAD down to 85 dB which is still quite competent:Noise level could be a bit lower at 5 watts but still respectable:Multitone test shows the very low distortion of the amplifier:Frequency response is flat which is an improvement over the 2200 model which drooped at 20 kHz:The word \"monoblocks\" sets up expectations of high amount of power and the 2220 delivers:This should be plenty of power for just about any use.Finally we can examine performance at different frequencies:Some strange distortion mechanism sets in at highest frequencies but only during a limited power range (hump in green).  Fortunately you hardly ever have content at high frequencies at high amplitude so not an audible concern.ConclusionsPerformance of the Outlaw 2220 is solid, solid, solid!  What can I say.  It delivers what you expect with nary any results that raise an eyebrow sans that high frequency distortion.  You have ton of power which should be handy for both stereo music listening and home theater.

      " all-in-one Marantz HD-AMP1 DAC and integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and retails for USD $1,100 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.The unit has a somewhat retro looking of other Marantz audio products with the round digital display and wood sides:There are both digital inputs and analog allowing one to build a complete system around the HD-AMP1.  I was surprised to not see RCA outputs though so no convenient way to use its internal DAC by itself.Amplification is through class-D technology which allowed the unit to run cool.  Without permission from its owner though, I did not put it through thermal stress.In addition to speaker output, there is also a headphone jack so I tested the output through that too.There is a lot of functionality in HD-AMP1.  I chose to test a few of them in this feature and will test more based on requests.MeasurementsI started by testing the DAC+headphone stage using our usual dashboard:As you see, I set the output to 2 volt which is the nominal output of stand-alone DACs.  Alas, performance is nothing to write home about.  Second harmonic distortion is quite high, setting the SINAD at just 85 dB.  This would put in the fourth quadrant of DACs tested (with one being the best).  We also have fair bit of harmonic spikes from the power supply from 180 Hz and up (multiple of 60 Hz mains frequency in US).Loading down the headphone output with 300 ohm, we get this:There are internal gain settings but I did not mess with them.  As it is, level of noise and distortion is quite high relative to desktop DAC+amp products.  Power output however is decent.Switching to the power amplifier, here is the power versus distortion+noise measurement:I have plotted three graphs using three different volume controls with input being swept up to 2 volts.  Distortion climbs less steeply than other amps so hard to know where to stop and measure the wattage.  I selected a conservative point and got 47 watts.  I believe the rating from Marantz is 70 watts using my 4 ohm load.    You could certainly get there and beyond if you tolerate more distortion.As I have noted, the performance is similar to budget amplifiers like NuForce STA-200 (dashed green) but not even remotely getting close to our best in class Hypex NC400 amplifier (dashed blue).  Best case performance is about SINAD of 72 dB or so.Above is with my 40 kHz AES-17 filter by the way.Frequency response was very good for a class D amplifier:And here is the broadband spectrum analysis of a 1 kHz tone:The first large spike comes at nearly 500 kHz which I am assuming is the switching frequency of its class-D amplifier.  Its second harmonic is at nearly 1 Mhz and down -60 dB.Finally, here is the harmonic distortion+noise versus frequency at 5 watts of output using 90 kHz of bandwidth:Once again, it is not on the same planet as the Hypex NC400.  It also has instability when the analyzer switches its frequency as indicated by the \"T\" symbols.  It takes some 5 seconds for the readings to become stable.  We saw this in the Behringer A500 amplifier review.ConclusionsI wanted to like the Marantz HD-AMP1.  It has been in demand for quite a while on the forum to measure it. Having done that, I see no signs of excellence. It follows the drifting backward industry trend of \"good enough\" performance specs.  This is reflected in lack of hardly any specifications provided by Marantz.  On feature side, it is very strange that there is no RCA outputs to use the DAC and pre-amp with a different power amplifier.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Marantz HD-AMP1.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.They say you should save money for a rainy day.

      " Allo Volt+ D class D amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $129 in this \"dual mono\" configuration with stepped attenuator.I am not a big fan of these clear cases but in this case, pun intended, it works!Hard to take a picture of it though without heavily accentuating dust and such that normally is not visible:Dual TI TPA2116 class D amplifiers are used plus a front-end switching power supplies to generate the required plus and minus supplies.Not that no power supply comes with this amplifier.  You have a choice of what you put in there.  I used my lab power supply at its max setting of 31 volts and 3 amps.  It could use more than 3 amps with 4 ohm load as the power supply current limited near max power sweeps.  It was fine with 8 ohm load though as that doesn't need as much current.There is no remote control so this is really a desktop amplifier.  There is a gain switch below that switches between 19 and 26 dB.  I used the default 19 dB which works well with desktop DACs that have no trouble producing near 2 volts you need for max power.Overall the Volt+ D makes a very positive impression with respect to looks and build quality.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is nice!  Budget class D amps routinely produce SINAD in 55 to 65 dB and here we are well above that at 84 dB:I was also impressed with how low the noise floor was at 5 watt playback:Many amplifiers fail to achieve 96 dB which is my target for this level of playback.Crosstalk is superb, better than just about any amp I have tested recently:Frequency response has a tiny bit of roll off at 20 kHz:As I noted in the introduction, with 4 ohm load my power supply lacks enough current so I also tested with one channel driven:So it seems that getting the 60 watt advertised power level is possible.Taking advantage of onboard capacitors, I ran my burst test:So even in stereo you have over 60 watts, going to nearly 90 watts with one channel.Power into 8 ohm load is naturally lower:Notice that noise floor is very low contributing to very good response at lower power levels.Varying the frequency gives us the following power levels and distortion:At or below 1 kHz response is excellent and frequency independent.  Above that it varies which is typical of many class D amps.Finally, I ran a spectrum analysis without my usual class D amp filter in the path:Wow, TI put some clever filtering/design in there.  Usually the switching frequency is down just 10 to 2 dB from our main tone.  Here, nothing rises above -88 dB or so!  TI advertises that the amp will not interfere with AM radio and it definitely won't.ConclusionsThe Allo Volt+ D amplifier is a delightful surprise.  Careful design has elevated the performance of these switching \"chip amplifiers\" to that of mass market hifi/class AB designs.  Yet, it runs cool and costs very little.  Yes, you need an external power supply and that is the only flaw I see with going with this solution.  Overall, I am happy to recommend the Allo Volt+ D for its nice and elegant design and performance especially at this price.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Good news: my garden helper text me that he is available to come and pull the weeds.

      "This is a review and detailed measurements of Amazon Echo Link Amp power amplifier, DAC and network streamer.  I purchased this from Amazon for USD $299 and it arrived yesterday.While rather featureless from front, the overall feel of the plastic and case is quite good:When you rotate the volume control white LEDs light up to show a coarse volume control.  They time out very quickly though so I could not capture them on the camera.Not sure what the hole is for.  Maybe it is for a remote control but none was provided.The back panel is the more interesting bit:In addition to the power amplifier, we have a nice little DAC and pre-amplifier here.  There are digital inputs in the form of both Coax and Toslink S/PDIF.  And of course we also have streaming capability with the Ethernet jack and wifi.  Surprisingly we also have S/PDIF and Toslink output for digital connectivity to other DACs and amplifiers.There is analog input and output.  Former can be used for your analog gear and the latter, for use as a DAC or pre-amp.  There are issues with this mode though.  See later in measurement section.Operationally the Link Amp runs very cool.  However at higher power there is an audible mechanical hissing sound likely caused by resonance of an internal inductor.  It was audible to me from 3 feet away without use of speakers (dummy loads).As you can imagine for a product with Amazon name of it, there is a professional looking label underneath with every regulatory and safety certification you would want to see.  This is important as the Link Amp like many other power amplifiers is mains operated with a lot of high power circuits.  Oddly there is no power button.Sadly there is hardly any documentation provided with the unit.  You are supposed to seek help in the Alexa app.  I naively assumed that connecting ethernet cable would mean the Link Amp wout get instantly recognized by the app but such was not the case.  I had to configure it using Wifi with the mess that is: connecting to local ad-hoc wifi it creates and then using the main home network.  Process was quite non-intuitive and took multiple reboots of phone and link amp to get it to finally recognize it.  Boy, do I miss the simplicity of the original echo.  Oddly, Alexa app provides no control over inputs!  I just fed it S/PDIF and it output that. Ditto for analog.  Can't tell what priority it will use if both are active.There is a volume control in the app but it only controls local/streaming content, not the volume control on the Amp.  Really?  The volume control is digital so why can't I control it in the app???Amazon has really lost its way here with respect to software here.  Added complexity over time has not been managed.Also at fault is the computer and networking industry that has not invented a new revision of Wifi standard that just works with devices like this.Overall, my impression of hardware is positive and software negative.Anyway, let's get into measurements.  With so much functionality here, I have chosen a subset to test, mostly focusing on the amplifier performance.DAC MeasurementsI was happy to see line out so thought we can check the performance of the DAC this way.  Alas, this was not meant to be as without a load, the amplifier shuts down when you turn up the volume to max to get the nominal voltage you like to see on a DAC.  There should be a software option to turn off the power amp so it doesn't do that.  So I had to connect my dummy loads to the amp to test it.  Here is the outcome:The power amplifier reduced performance by about 5 dB. SINAD was 92 dB or so without the load.  The current values put the Link Amp in the lower tier of DACs tested:It would have gone into a tier higher if I didn't have to run the power amplifier along with it.Here is the DAC frequency response which was promoted by later test results:The 44.1 kHz sampling results are fine.  What is not fine is that no matter what other sample rate you use, you get the same bandwidth!  In other words, while higher sample rates are accepted, everything seems to be down sampled to 44.1 or 48 kHz.  So forget any dreams you have of high resolution audio.Power Amplifier MeasurementsImportant note before we get into this section: during testing the results were a complete mess at lower frequencies.  The graphs were literally not readable with very high variations of THD+N.  So I spent a few hours with my son working through it and turned out some of these class-D amps cause frequency modulation at low frequencies which throws off the analyzer notch filter.  The result was that THD+N would go from correct value to 20%+ which would totally screw things up on the graph.  I found a good work-around for this which made the measurements look a lot nicer.  Alas, this means you can't quite compare these results to previous measurements where this issue was visible.  Fortunately we had very clean amplifiers such as Hypex NC400 without this issue so those results stand.Let's start with power amplifier dashboard st 5 watts using digital input:When I tested the SONOS Amp there was a lot of degradation with analog input so let's test that:Ah, a sigh of relief.  Performance actually improves a bit using analog in!  Noise floor is flatter and lower although not enough to make the SINAD any different.  Putting that value in context of other power amplifiers tested, we get this:I updated this graph with the digital input of SONOS which nicely outperforms the Link Amp.  However, as noted with analog input the Amazon Link Amp is much better.Frequency response with digital input shows the same bandwidth limitation that the DAC did:Same test with analog input shows a droop at low frequencies as well:Note that even when using analog input, you are limited to the same 24 kHz bandwidth!  Someone didn't want you to mess with high resolution audio no matter what.  That aside, there is now a low frequency roll off too.Here is the signal to noise ratio:Let's deal with the most important test: power output versus distortion and noise:Compared to other budget amps like the $199 Topping TP60, there is much more power here and at lower noise and distortion.  Don't like one channel having more distortion though.A more direct competitor is the SONOS amp which costs twice as much but otherwise has streaming functionality:The Link Amp has better noise level but that is because SONOS has poor performance with its analog input.  The SONOS has tons more power and its two channels are staying in synch.  So the SONOS is a better deal here putting the cost aside.  Of course neither comes remotely close to our reference Hypex NC400 DIY build (at > $1,000).There has been some interest in running jitter tests on these power amplifiers.  So here is a snapshot of that:The THD+N versus level and frequency where my new tests show much cleaner results:Note that I have limited the bandwidth to 61 kHz. That is enough to capture the third harmonic of 20 kHz but low enough to keep the ultrasonic noise that these amps have.  I will show that in a bit.  Here we see that distortion rises with low and high frequencies.  The curve though matches how our hearing works in that we are much less sensitive in low and high frequencies so the distortion products are likely not audibly a problem.  Note then that testing at 1 khz shows the best case scenario for these class D amplifiers.I have another variation of above where I sweep the level/power and keep the frequency the same:We see that at 20,000 Hz, the two channels perform the same.  But as soon as we lower the test to 2,000 Hz and then 200 Hz, one channel gets a lot worse. This tells me there is insufficient power supply capacitor reserve for one channel than for the other.  The lower frequencies are more taxing this way because they stay at their extreme peaks of the sine wave longer.Lastly, here is our ultrasonic spectrum of a 1 kHz tone:We see our sharp spike around 600 kHz indicating that is the switching frequency.  The rise in ultrasonics around 100 khz shows noise shaping (pulling noise out of audible band and stuffing it here).  Levels for these are quite low as class-D amps go, showing good attention to filtering, no doubt helped with the limited bandwidth of 24 kHz.ConclusionsMechanically and from safety and emissions point of view, Amazon Echo Link amp delivers for just $299.  This puts it way ahead of many offerings in this price range which are more akin to DIY efforts than a polished product.  On top of that, you have streaming, DAC and a digital and analog pre-amplifier.  This is a lot and I suspect Amazon is losing money on each one or barely breaking even.While some attention has been paid to produce a performant product, there are clear limitations and issues here and there.  Limiting of the bandwidth to 24 khz in all modes is a miss objectively but not subjectively.  As with other class D amps, we have odd behavior here and there such as rise in low frequency distortion, ultrasonic noise.The mechanical whistling while the amp is pushed should have been caught and fixed although in practice, the music should mask that well.At $299 with so many features and generally good performance, I am going to go ahead and put the Amazon Echo Link Amp on my recommended list.  No, it is no audiophile find.  But for secondary use its performance is good enough to make it a good buy.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Got a very interesting email from a guy by the name of Ahmad from Nigeria.  Says they actually have money trees there in the jungle and he is willing to send me some for free (to get publicity on ASR) if I just provide for shipping and special handling of $2,000.  So please donate money so I can buy a few and get rich:Patreon: orupgrading\n",
      " Peachtree GAN400 stereo balanced (input) amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,499.I am not generally a fan of peachtree audio product looks but this one in coffee stain looks pretty good.  Other than a power switch, not much else is there.  Ditto on the back side:The claim to fame of this amplifier is use of GaN transistors which in theory simplify the design of a class D amplifier (a bit) and improve its efficiency (a bit).  And in theory, it can also produce lower distortion (in open loop anyway).  The drawback is much higher cost of the transistors compared to MOSFETs.  Let's see if the performance is there.Peachtree GAN400 MeasurementsI performed all of my testing using XLR input.  Let's start with our usual input of 1 kHz with output into 4 ohm to the tune of 5 watts:There is fair bit of inconsistency between the channels with respect to SINAD.  I switched my loads and issue persisted so it is not my setup.  Averaging the two we get 84 dB which is slightly average for all amps tested but not where performance should be:Frequency response is disappointing as it shows load dependency:This means that the high frequency response will be speaker dependent which is not good.  I expect this kind of performance in ultra budget amplifiers (under $100), not at this price.Noise performance is good but again, not where it should be:Same for multitone distortion:Crosstalk however, is superb indicating two independent amplifiers:There is lots of power both at 4 and 8 ohms:As noted though, the curve starts to go up prior to clipping which means distortion is increasing.The amplifier more than meets its 400 watt spec at 1% THD:The shape of THD+N graph is very smooth which perhaps could be attributed to GaN transistor design:There is no pop on power up but there is when you shut it down:The amp is stable on power up so no need to leave it on:Peachtree GAN400 Power Stress TestWith the owner's permission , I subjected the amp to varying load angle (phase) and down to 2 ohm impedance.  It did very well:Variations of ±60 degrees did not bother it at all at either 4 or 8 ohm.  A bit strangely, at 2 ohm it would not run with 0 load angle but did produce half the output at other angles (hard to see in the 3-D graph).  Since minimum impedance is 2.5 oh, we can't fault it for this.  FYI I tested a couple of amps at my disposal and the both got quite unhappy with varying phase angles, shutting down and such.  Whereas the GAN400 marched through this test without once going into protection.ConclusionsI just bought a 65 watt GaN based USB-C charger and am amazed at how small it is.  The buzz from there has travelled to audio and has resulted in GaN based amps like this Peachtree.  Alas, there is no performance advantage that can be seen in this implementation.  Noise+Distortion is only slightly better than average and far cry from top performing amplifiers we have tested in the past.  Combine this with quite high price of $2,500 and this is a difficult offer to swallow.  Good news is that there is plenty of power at 400+ watts independent of the load (4 or 8 ohm).Personally I don't see a reason to pay so much for this level of performance so I can't recommend the Peachtree GAN400 amplifier.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " AIYIMA A07 Pro stereo amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs about $90.As you see the distinguishing factor from some of the other Aiyima amplifiers is inclusion of tone controls. Alas, that is also where the problem is with this unit: there is no detent and no way of setting its response to flat. Worse yet small changes in the dials will make large differences in tonality. So while I like having toner controls, I definitely like to see a tone defeat feature.  Otherwise the unit feels nice to use and operate.  As is typical, the power supply is much larger than the amplifier itself:AIYIMA A07 Pro MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into a pure 4 ohm load, driven to stereo at 5 watts:We expect good performance from AIYIMA and we get it:Switching to my PowerCube Loadbox, we can simulate more complex loads: (1 channel tested)As you see, performance is essentially the same.Noise performance is good enough for this class of budget amplifiers:Multitone shows good performance:Frequency response unfortunately is load (speaker) dependent:So you may be forced to use the treble control to adjust high frequency response for your speaker.Crosstalk is very good:Let's get into all important power measurements starting with 4 ohm:This is plenty for desktop use.  Switching to 8 ohm naturally robs us of fair amount of power:Fortunately vast majority of speakers on the market are 4 ohm nominal.To see stability of the amplifier, let's subject it to suite of loads and reactive components:An ideal amplifier would follow the red line.  We are essentially there for both 8 and 4 ohm.  Surprisingly this little amp managed to also keep running at 2 ohm, albeit without capacitive component and some power drop.  Many amps simply shut down and won't even work into 2 ohm.Edit: here is the response vs frequency that I forgot to post originally:Finally, here is the warm up profile:In use, the amplifier ran pretty cool.ConclusionsThe AIYIMA A07 Pro continues the tradition of the company providing competent levels of noise and distortion, good bit of power and very reasonable price.  While tone controls are a nice added feature, they lack a defeat switch.  And we have our usual load dependency.Personally I very much dislike the lack of tone control defeat so won't buy it.  But if that doesn't bother you, then the AIYIMA A07 Pro is another good bargain in stereo amplification.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Peachtree Nova 300 integrated amplifier with DAC and phono stage.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,199.  The Nova 300 fits in the same chassis Peachtree has successfully used for last 15 years:It is quite beefy and heavy.  Volume indication overloads the LED indicators on the input selectors showing a coarse 8 levels.  For this price, I would expect an LED indicator of the actual level.Back panel shows good quality connectors and rich feature set for a desktop amplifier:Peachtree made its name on DACs and had quite a following 10 to 15 years ago.  I was curious to see if they had upgraded the DAC subsystem since that time so let's start by measuring that subsystem.Peachtree Nova 300 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit over USB input, sampled the output from preamp out and adjusted the volume to output 2 volts:Well, this is quite disappointing.  Noise and distortion as represented by SINAD is in decidedly \"poor\" category in today's market:The unit can output higher levels so let's see where peak performance is:No luck there as the peak is actually at 1 volt out.Dynamic range is better indicating distortion is the problem:At this point I didn't see a need to run more DAC tests and switched to testing the amplifier.Peachtree Nova 300 Amplifier MeasurementsFor this test I used the Aux analog input:Ah, this is very respectable and above average performance:SNR is not as good as I like at 5 watt but gets better at full power:Crosstalk is excellent:Frequency response shows a peaky filter though:Multi-tone results indicate \"good enough\" performance:What was most impressive is the amount of power available from the ICE amplifier module they are using:Since I am driving two channels, this is over 900 watts of power!  Indeed the peaks hit 1000+ watts:Even at 8 ohm there is copious amount of power available:Interesting to see little dependency on frequency until we hit a few watts:ConclusionsIt is clear from the measurements that the DAC subsystem is a relic that is simply behind times.  The product though benefits from using a competent B&O ICE module which has stayed competitive producing far more power than you would expect in a \"lifestyle\" product of this kind.  As such, I expect subjective performance of Nova 300 to be excellent regardless of what speaker you attach to it.  I usually don't worry about price/performance in my reviews -- that is yours to worry about.    But here, the price seems quite high relative to the other internet focused amplifiers which have come out in the last couple of years.  Some of those are powerful and all of them cost a lot less than the Nova 300.Overall, I can't recommend the Peachtree Nova 300 as a new purchase.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Fosi Audio BT20A stereo class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 IC. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $99.99 with 32 volt power supply.Despite its low cost, the case gives a feeling of quality. I am not usually fan of tone controls in low cost amps because you can never set them to flat response (the detents are there but don't work). As you will in the measurements, Fosi has made sure that they work correctly in this instance.  A stout power switch controls power. In addition to 32 volt supply, company also shipped the optional ($40) 48 volt supply which is quite a giant:As you see, Bluetooth input is also supported.FYI there is an included orange volume control knob to give the unit some color.Fosi Audio BT20A Pro MeasurementsThe tests are in 48 volt unless I say otherwise (I had mistakenly assumed it was the standard, not the 32 volt).  Here is our dashboard:Notice the great channel match in addition to very good SINAD which represents noise and distortion.  Same is true with 32 volt supply:This nicely lands the BT20A Pro in the \"very good\" category of all amplifiers tested regardless of price:Zooming in to see the competition:SNR is good for the class:I expect load/impedance dependency in this class of switching amplifiers but here, the peaking is almost entirely out of band which is good:Seeing how you have tone controls anyway, you could tailor any peaking with adjustment of the treble control.  Won't be exact but should be good enough.That aside, note how the response is more or less is flat in audible band with the treble and bass controls set to their detent, center position.Multitone is good enough for the class:Crosstalk is very good:Let's start our 4 ohm power measurements with 48 volt supply:Wow, this little box can pump out some serious watts, albeit in the short term testing!  Switching to 32 volts cuts this down even though 4 ohm is mostly current limited:The larger power supply must have more capacitor reservoirs than the 32 volt.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally see the biggest hit to power: [Edit early version had the wattage wrong]Although to be fair, I put the cursor at an earlier point than for 48 volt supply (not enough measurement points there).I was pleasantly surprised by the transfer function being so smooth:Finally there is not much of a pop on but there is for off:ConclusionsThe TI TPA3255 seems to be a capable platform when paired with a good implementation which is what we have in BT20A Pro.  You get a sense of that in company marketing material which includes Audio Precision measurements.  Usability is excellent with high quality case and controls especially with respect to ability to set the tone controls to flat.It is also nice to see so much power coming out of this little box with the beefy 48 volt power supply, showcasing the advancements in amplification density we have today.As an aside, the company has been a joy to work with.  They were exceptionally polite, cordial and patient as I went through my testing and evaluation.  They tell me they have internal R&D team and it shows.I am happy to add the Fosi Audio BT20A Pro to my recommended list.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " IOTAVX SA3 integrated stereo amplifier with built-in DAC and subwoofer output.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs £399.00 (on sale from £449.00) on company's website.  Hard to find it on sale in US but found one ebay listing for $498.SA3 nails the industry design with svelte chassis, dot matrix display and judicious use of backlighting for the logo: I left the plastic on the display as otherwise it looks nicer than it does in the picture.  A reassuring power button is the left and a nice feeling rotary control handles the volume.  If you press it, it becomes an input selector.  Very nicely done.Back panel shows a lot of inputs:There is phono input which I did not test.  I did test both analog input and Toslink digital input.  Sadly there is no USB input.  There is bluetooth but no streaming support over network.Let's get started by using the line in (analog) input to the power amp and work our way out to the DAC section.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWith integrated amplifiers with volume controls, I adjust that to produce roughly 29 dB of gain which is a THX \"standard.\"  That gives us this dashboard:Distortion dominates with second harmonic telling the full story.  Wish channel 2 was as good as channel 1 but this is typical.  Averaging the two we get this kind of ranking:So above average among 89 amplifiers tested so far (!).  But not state of the art by any stretch.Noise performance is good:You almost clear the CD's 16-bit dynamic range at 96 dB at 5 watts output.Typical of class AB designs, bandwidth is abundant:Should the zombie apocalypse come, you can hook up a few hundred yards of wire to the speaker wire and have yourself an AM transmitter power amp!!!  A microphone and simple modulator and you could be talking to people thousands of miles away at night....Crosstalk is surprisingly good:If you look inside the chassis, you realize why.  A toroidal transformer is in the middle with each amplifier nicely separated from each other by good 8 to 10 inches.Power output at 4 ohms falls a bit short of the spec:And I am not too happy about the constant rise in distortion from just 1 watt, ending worse than one of our worse performing Audio Video Receiver (the NAD T758).It is a bit happier driving an 8 ohm load:That's not a lot of power though so best get an efficient speaker is 8 ohm is the language it speaks.Fortunately burst power is quite decent (only 4 ohm shown):Changing the frequency of the test tone hardly bothers the SA3:Other topologies such as Class D make a mess out of this measurement.DAC Audio MeasurementsTaking advantage of the pre-amp output, I fired off a few DAC tests to get an idea of how good that subsystem is starting with our digital dashboard:OK, this is a bit disappointing.  You want a SINAD here that is 10 dB better than the amp for it to be transparent.  Here it is actually a couple of dB worse then the amplifier which means the combo will drag down the performance of the amplifier some.As a DAC, it falls in the failing (red) category of all DACs tested to date:Noise performance is decent:Intermodulation+noise test is disappointing:The upper line in orange is a phone dongle!  The SA3 hugs that performs like it is related to it which it should not be.Jitter performance looks better than it is due to high noise floor potentially hiding other spurious tones:So overall the DAC portion is barely a match for the amplifier.  If the amp gets the grade B, the DAC gets a C+.ConclusionsIt is nice to see a fresh take on the integrated stereo amplifier from IOTAVIX.  The SA3 looks attractive, has good feature set including many inputs from digital to analog and takes up little space. You can nicely put it under your monitor, add a couple of speakers and be in business.You don't get to brag its measured performance but what is there \"is not broken\" which is often an accomplishment in world of audio.  Performance is solid across the board with the DAC trailing a bit.  I would happily use it in a secondary system.Overall, I am going to recommend the IOTAVIX SA2 amplifier.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Every day I am in the garden, digging holes, removing rocks and weed and planting until my back can't take it anymore.  Then I come inside and do these reviews.  I am thinking this definitely qualifies for overtime.  So even if you have donated before, you owe me an extra 50% in donations : @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      "This is a review and detailed measurements of Living Sound Audio Electronics Voyager GAN 350 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US 3,000 from the company.I really like the high-end look of this amplifier case:Strange though as there is no power indicator, nor switch.  The latter is in the back only:I really dislike the hard to read type on the back.  Other than that, the connectors seem to be of good quality.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses GaN transistors to ostensibly lower distortion and increase efficiency of the amplification.  In use, the bottom where all the modules are mounted barely god warm so efficiency is good.LSA Voyager GAN350 MeasurementsI started my testing with XLR inputs which showed really odd results:As you see, the gain is nearly 10 dB different between the channels.  I looked for configuration switches but couldn't find anything.  After wasting half hour, I switched to RCA input and problem vanished:If I were to guess I would say the XLR input is miswired on one channel.  Bad execution if so in such an expensive amplifier.  For the rest of the test I stuck with RCA input.Signal to noise ratio while OK, is not state of the art:I like to see full 16 bit/96 dB dynamic range at 5 watts.  We fall short here.Frequency response was sad to see:Class D amplifiers have a low pass filter that can interact with the load if not designed well and that is what we have here.  The impact falls clearly in audible band.  This would be OK for a budget amplifier in $100 range but not in this class.  Depending on what speaker you hook up to this amplifier, the highs may be exaggerated or filtered.Crosstalk on the other hand was exceptional due to dual mono design and no crosstalk through the power supply:Multitone performance was also very good, indicating low intermodulation distortion:Power was healthy into 4 ohm albeit with unexceptional distortion and noise levels:There is still plenty of power available even into 8 ohm:Interesting how distortion keeps rising and clipping is rather soft.  As they state, this indicates low amount of negative feedback.Transfer function is frequency dependent with distortion rising quite a bit at higher frequencies (likely due to that low feedback level):Spectrum of switching frequency shows good attenuation but not that high of a frequency:If they had opted for higher speed which GaN transistors allow, the impact of the output filter would have been lower (and possibly above audible band).The amplifier doesn't need any warm up as it is stable on power on:ConclusionsOther than having a lot of power and good efficiency, there is not much else to be happy here.  Clearly companies are using GaN as a buzzword without fully taking advantage of what it can provide.  Lots of money is left on the table here in many areas from frequency response load dependency to high amount of distortion.  At the end of the day, you have an expensive, high power amplifier here with average performance.I can't recommend the LSA Voyager GAN 350.  Performance is not there, nor is quality control.Edit: teardown just posted: always,\n",
      "This is a review and detailed measurements of AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier with Bluetooth support. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $139.99.It is so nice to see a VU meter on an amplifier!  This one actually seems high quality with nice ballistic response (fast jump, a bit slower retard). Bass and Treble controls are there but I wish there was a tone defeat as well. The position of the indicators is where I had to set them for more or less flat response. I do like the very fine detents on it, allowing you to more precisely adjust them at least.The included power supply is one of the largest I have seen but is rather light for its size:There are no remotes so the amp is for desktop use.  Class D implementation means the amp ran with no temperature rise even after all my tests. Protection circuit was excellent with automatic restarted after overload. The meter is useful in this regard as the amp shuts down when the meter is almost at the end of its range.AIYIMA A08 Pro MeasurementsI warmed up the unit for about 10 minutes with very stable response:Running our dashboard we see the usual good performance from AIYIMA amplifier range:Performance is above average despite the very low cost:Noise level falls in the same category of very good:As noted, there was a bit of a struggle to get flat response:And typical of their designs, there is load dependency.Crosstalk was above average for all amplifiers tested:Multitone performance was very good:This little box outputs good bit of power at 4 ohms:Even with 8 ohm load you have good bit of it:Transfer function (frequency vs power) is pretty good for class:ConclusionsAIYIMA has a good class D platform which they turn into various configurations with good success.  The A08 Pro is no exception.  You get unique looks and to some extent, functionality at still a very reasonable price.  With 100 watts per channel, both driven, you have very nice capability to drive any desktop speaker to its limit.  My own wish is the remedy of the load dependency but otherwise, this is a job well done.I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " AIYIMA A07 desktop amplifier based on TPA3255 class D amplifier chip.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  The cost is US $72 on Amazon including prime shipping.  And as of this shipping, it also included a 32 volt, 5 amp switching power supply.  Member also purchased and sent me a 48 volt/3 amp power supply which I also tested.The case is standard budget audio affair:The volume control feels cheep but does the job.  The back panel terminals were way too small for my binding posts:The DC input socket was quite stiff especially with the 48 volt power supply.  Tightness is not a bad thing as far as power transfer is concerned but this was a bit too stiff.  Here are the two power supplies:They both feel kind of cheap as they would be at these prices ($21 for the 48 volt one).  Personally I would not leave these plugged in permanently if I am not around.  The included power supply has a two-pronged AC cable that was not polarized.  Rotating it around made a small difference in mains leakage.AIYIMA A07 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohms:As you see in the FFT display, there is considerable amount of mains leakage at 60 Hz.  This tends to be a function of switching power supplies.  I played with grounding and improved it a lot in one channel but not in the other (not shown).  SINAD did not get impacted since it is bound by distortion harmonics.  As it is, performance is above average:Signal to noise ratio is not great due to the mains hum:Frequency response is well behaved, albeit with a slight droop at 20 kHz:Crosstalk is good and well above bargain basement desktop amps:Power is everything in a small amp so let's see how we do with 4 ohm load:As expected, with low impedance of 4 ohm we are current limited so the 5 amp stock power supply does better, turning in 77 watts.  Yes, the 300 watt rating is a fantasy but maybe it can do better with momentary peaks.  Alas, its aggressive protection circuit would shut it down and not let me test max and peak power.Naturally the higher voltage power supply does better with 8 ohm load where we become voltage limited:Sweeping power vs frequency and distortion shows a very well behaved class D amplifier:ConclusionsTraditionally these desktop amplifiers have produced really poor performance in the form of noise and distortion.  Not so anymore.  These TPA3255 based amps seem to have good bones in them, producing above average performance for peanuts.  Alas, you are saddled with two boxes and cheap and potentially non-safety compliant parts.  For desktop use, these are probably acceptable compromises.  I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A07 based on its performance.And with this, our last review of 2020 comes to an end!  Nice that it is ending on a happy note.  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Linn AV5125 5-channel amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  It is out of production but originally cost US $2999.  I only see one used one on ebay for $2100 which seems pretty expensive for an old amp.  Then again Linn is a high-end audio company so maybe it holds its value?EDIT: member feedback shows prices are really in US $600 range for used units.Despite the high channel count, the AV5125 is quite light and small:The back of the unit shows the unusual BFA (British Federation of Audio) speaker connectors:I had to rebuild my test harness to test it which I was none too happy about it.  It basically a banana plug but hollow on the inside.The trick to light weight is a switching power supply and a set of fans to cool the heatsinks:A pair of integrated IC amps are used for each channel.  The heatsink is beefy despite its reduced height.  In use the fans never came on.  I am suspecting some kind of rail switching is used to keep power consumption low.Overall, it is a \"cute\" design if you have to ask me.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with a simple 1 kHz tone driving the amplifier to 5 watts with 4 ohm load:SINAD which is a combined metric of noise and distortion is above average of 90+ amplifiers tested in all forms:Crosstalk is not very good:Frequency response is also not flat which is surprising:Dynamic range though is very good especially near full power:As noted though, when I ran the full power test momentarily, it started to scream quite loud.  How loud you say?  Well, my wife who was downstairs, listening to her podcast using headphones heard it and asked, \"are you making that beeping sound?\"  So there, we also have wife stories in our tests!Power test produced an unusual curve:As you see in the two reference amplifier tests in dashed lines, usually the graph points down due to noise contributions lowering as power goes up.  Not here.  The curve is flat which indicates constant distortion.  That is not a bad thing per se as we see really good performance until we exceed 20 watts and then we get ordinary response.Same repeats with 8 ohm load:Here, at low power we have very clean output.Back to 4 ohm load, we can see how much more power we get if we relax distortion to 1% and also measuring momentary power:The news is not good as is typical in amplifiers with switching power supplies which run regulated.  For good or bad, you get maximum power they have in all conditions.  Typical class AB amplifier has unregulated power supply rails which due to a capacitor bank, can produce more power in short duration.ConclusionsThis is an unusual design from a high-end company which went after \"home theater\" market back in the day when they could (prior to HDMI video standard putting them all out of this business).  The guts is not high-end but seems custom and well thought out.  Performance is reasonable to good.  I tend to like the originality, small size, light weight and proper engineering from this Scottish company.If you can find one on the cheap (well under $1000), then it is worth looking at the Linn AV5125.  I am going to recommend it more from emotional point of view, than logic.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Look: it is a fact that if you donate to ASR, you will enjoy many benefits.

      " AIYIMA A200 stereo amplifier with USB DAC and Bluetooth. It was sent to me by the company and costs about US $160.The compact size should fit on desks well.  Controls are simplicity in themselves: push in the volume control to select input (RCA or Bluetooth/USB).  Rotate for volume.Nice to see built-in power supply unlike other AIYIMA offerings that required large external ones.  Design is based on TI TPA3255 IC.AIYIMA A200 MeasurementsLet's start with RCA input:SINAD which represents a measure of noise and distortion is above average:Unfortunately digital input degrades that some:So the rest of the tests are with RCA input.  SNR is good for class:As is distortion as represented by multitone:Frequency response is flat enough but is load (speaker) dependent:Crosstalk is good:Let's see how much clean power it can produce with 4 and 8 ohm loads:Allowing for 1% THD we don't get more power but burst delivery is higher:For a desktop amp, this is pretty good amount of juice.Sweeping at different frequencies shows very predictable response:Of note, power doesn't drop much at 20 Hz which is very good (and important).Finally the amp is good more or less when you power it up:ConclusionsAIYIMA once again shows that it has as solid hold in the mid-power amplifier market with above average performance at bargain prices. Integrated power supply solves one of the hassles of their separates and provides nice turnkey solution.  Interface and build is good for the class.  So really, if you want a competent amplifier with good power and little money, you have it.I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A200 amplifier.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Hegel H95 integrated amplifier with DAC and streaming support. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2000.The H95 looks pretty nice:I really like the large, high resolution and very responsive graphic display. What I don't like is the absence of power button on the front face.  After some research I found out it is on the bottom.  I realize without it there is symmetry but the one or two times that you play something super loud and want to rush to shut it off, you will hate the fact that it will take some effort to reach under to power it down.  Another thing I didn't like is lack of acceleration on volume control.  You have to crank and crank it to turn it all the way up and down.The back panel shows the extra connectively over a standard analog amplifier:Very nice to see built-in DAC and Ethernet streaming.  What is not is the maximum supported sample rate of 96 kHz over USB.  This tells me they are using ancient and obsolete USB interface.  They say they did this for ease of design and to save money to put toward making the DAC itself better.  We will see about that.A simple plastic remote control is provided which is very similar to what we see from Chinese desktop manufacturers.  I tend to like it but it is unusual for such an expensive product to come with this kind of remote.  Usually they include some heavy but harder to use remote.Hegel H95 DAC MeasurementsThis being an amplifier, I immediately jumped to measuring that part of it first.  But then I had to backtrack when I noticed digital input performance was worse than analog.  Given the line out, I decided to measure the DAC using coax input.  For some reason, like a Hegel DAC I tested in the past, my ASIO4ALL interface would not see the USB input so I decided to test with Coax.  Here is our dashboard with volume control adjusted to produce the nominal 2 volts:I don't need to tell you that this is stunning high level of distortion, landing the H95 seven from the bottom list of some 350 DACs tested:When sweeping IMD distortion level, we can see part of the problem:This is something we see in Audio/Video receivers where they set the optimal gain to drive their amplifiers and not the 2 volts we are looking for.  Even then performance is not good, barely showing less noise than a $9 phone dongle!  We can measure the noise itself:This is horrid performance in any modern DAC.Back to distortion, we see that again in multitone test:Jitter performance is lackluster and what I would expect to see from random ebay DAC:To finish our suffering, here is poor linearity measurement:I think they may have unseated Schiit with their multibit DACs and poor linearity!Really, really bad showing.Hegel H95 Amplifier MeasurementsI first started with line in and adjusted the volume to get the nominal gain of 29 dB we use in integrated amplifier tests:Noise and distortion is just above average:I expected a lot better as the company's claim to fame is a comparator which supposedly detects distortion and sends an inverted signal to the amp to correct.  We see plenty of amplifiers without such circuit performing far better as you can see in above graph.  And of course we have products that use true feed forward technology such as Benchmark AHB2 currently occupying #1 spot in above graph.What's more, there are stability issues with that circuit (my guess).  Check out the warm up performance of this amplifier:I have never seen anything like this.  Variations are quite large (as much as 3 dB) with two very large spikes.  It never stabilized even though I let it warm up far longer than other amps to tune of 17 minutes.  Best case performance was actually when the amplifier was just powered on at 80.5 dB SIAND but then finishing at 79.5.  Switching to DAC input which one would hope would eliminate source of external noise made things worse, not better in that regard:You are losing 9 dB in SINAD due to much higher noise floor.  Why or why?  Again, AV receivers do this but I don't think I have measured this kind of degradation before when using digital input.So from here on I focused on analog input.  Here is our dynamic range:I like to see 96 dB at 5 watts but 91 is fine.  The max power performance doesn't improve much because this is not a very powerful amplifier.Crosstalk is also good:Frequency response is flat in audible band:Power output is just 63 watts into 4 ohm at the knee of the distortion curve:Allowing for more distortion and busting sharply increased available power:Power into 8 ohm is very low for this expensive of an amplifier:Checking for frequency dependency we see something limiting power before the amplifier naturally doing so:Hegel H95 Headphone AmplifierI usually don't bother testing headphone output on this type of amplifier as it is usually an afterthought.  But company talks about improving its output and noise level relative to prior products so I decided to test it some.  Here is our power curve into 300 ohm:I like to see 100 milliwatts of power here and 80 is close enough.  Switching to low impedance, we should get a lot more power but we do not:The guarantee reason is high output impedance and that is precisely what we have:I am amazed that in this day and age companies like Hegel are not aware of the fact that high impedance is bad for many headphones (changes their tonality) and that even budget headphone amps have impedance below 1 ohm.  77 ohm is just out of the question.ConclusionsLet's quickly agree that both the DAC and headphone amplifiers are junk.  They are better off leaving both out.  You can do better with hundreds of products that cost the same as the shipping or tax of the H95.  I watched one video where the youtuber said he preferred the sound of Hegel DAC to his Chord Mojo in some ways.  Wonder what he thinks now.The amplifier in H95 is good as far as noise and distortion but nothing to write home about.  Continuous power is very low for an amplifier costing $2000 however.This is just a bad attempt all around.  I can't see any reason to recommend Hegel H95.  Company needs to go back to the drawing board and design performant DACs and headphone amplifiers as a minimum.  On amplification, they are being left behind by proper feedforward designs and excellent class D with tons of power. ----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " SMSL DA-6 stereo desktop class D amplifier. It was sent to me by Shenzhen Audio and costs US $99.Ah, what a pleasure it was to unpack the DA-6 and see this nice thin packaging!  That niceness extends to the back, fixing one of my main complaints with compact amplifiers:Instead of stacking the binding posts on top of each other and thereby making it very difficult to put large binding posts, they are lined up horizontally.  This allowed me to connect my locking banana plugs into them with relative ease. Of course we are saddled with large laptop power supply running at 24 volts at nearly 7 amps.A remote control is provided to navigate through the menus to change bass/treble settings, volume control, etc.  Same can be done with the front panel and rotary control.A new Infineon class D amplifier IC is used here (didn't see the model number).SMSL DA-6 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard:Relative sum of noise+distortion as expressed in SINAD lands the unit above average of some 350 amplifiers tested:I am assuming volume is controlled digitally given the perfect channel balanced.  Noise performance by itself is good for the class:Frequency response in EQ bypass mode still has a bit of low frequency roll off:Type of speaker you drive with this little amp could benefit from being pushed to play those low frequencies.  I thought I could fix that by boosting the bass setting one notch.  That tool though brings a sledgehammer to a nail being put on the wall to hang a picture:Oh, I forgot to mention that there is no load dependency which is something we often can't find even in expensive class D amplifiers.  Not only that, the response is quite extended, going beyond 100 kHz!  I guess this is what they mean by \"high-resolution.\"There is no warm up requirement as the unit is stable out of the box, running quite cool:Multitone performance is again good for the class:Output power is more modest than I wanted to see but I guess you can't have miracles:The response though seems dependent on level and keeps changing at micro level.   We see the same when we sweep with different frequencies:There is no headroom as expected:ConclusionsSMSL nails the industrial design and usability of a super compact desktop amplifier offered in attractive aluminum case.  A clear white display shows the volume control and inclusion of remote control lets you place it out of the way and still change its volume.  I don't usually take price into account but in this class I must.  For $99 this is a lot of performance and good lucks/design.I am happy to recommend SMSL DA-6.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " B&K Components AV30.2 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The AV30.2 is discontinued but is available on the used market for low price I am told.  I found one listing with asking price of $175 but not others.  The good news is that it uses the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE class-D amplifier module so the review should be relevant to other amplifiers in the market now.The B&K amp is targeted the CI (custom integration) market meaning it is usually installed in home and businesses by a dealer/installer as part of a larger system.  This amp for example could be hidden behind a flat panel TV powering a couple of speakers.  For this reason, the form-factor and connectivity follows the requirements for this market.Here is the front panel:The \"business end\" is on the back:As you can tell, there is fair amount of connectivity for home automation.  I did not investigate them but I imagine you can power the unit on and off remotely to say, synchronise with the TV being turned on/off.I liked the level control for both channels.  It is buttery smooth, putting many other volume controls to shame.  Using that, I was able to get perfect match between the two channels -- something you can't hardly do with any modern amplifier anymore.The speaker connections use phoenix connectors which while super common in CI industry, was not the greatest choice here.  It was very easy to have the outputs short out if you left any copper sticking out the screw terminal.  In use, the connector did not make tight enough connection causing the performance of one channel to vary as much as 20 dB.  It was tight by feel but noise level would go up and down if I wiggled it.  For intended application probably did not matter.  If you want to use it for hifi home application, you may want to hard wire them if you run into the same issue I did.In use, the unit barely got warm to touch.  There is plenty of ventilation on top and bottom which helps in this regard as does the high efficiency of its switchmode power supply and class-d amplification module.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard at 5 watt into 4 ohm:I adjusted the output gain to 29 dB which means the controls were near max.  Performance may vary some at lower gain values.  I used 29 dB since it is probably the most common/THX recommended gain level.THD+N was 0.008%.  The 50ASX2SE spec from what I recall is less than half at 0.003%.  The discrepancy may be due to gain stage, the connector and just variation in units.  Overall, it is in the ballpark of what they advertise.   This translates into a SINAD above mid-point of all the amplifiers we have tested:Signal to noise ratio is just good enough for 16-bit audio playback at 98 dB at full power:On right is the same measurement but relative to max of 5 watts.  SNR does not drop much which is very good.Frequency response was dead flat in audible band and quite well-behaved with output filtering:Wide-band FFT spectrum shows ugliness that we typically see in class-d amps (at 5 watt here) and this is probably a more uglier than the normal picture:More of a visual scare though than audio.Most important measurement for an amplifier is power versus distortion and noise.  Let's start with the common load of 4 ohm:As you see, one channel started to deviate as I said in the introduction.  But still, both of them are smooth and well-behaved giving us a power rating of 42 watts before hard clipping sets in.At 8 ohm, power level drops a lot as you would expect:Funny there though in how much lower noise and distortion the AV30.2 has compared to the NAD T758 AV Receiver (in dashed blue).  Would be a good replacement for it had it had more power.  If the modules higher in range have same performance, they may be a good application to power home theaters.That said, these modules have almost no headroom as their peak power is almost the same as average:This is because unlike class AB amplifiers, the power supply in these class-D amps is regulated and so other than some storage in output caps, can't provide more juice for short periods. Another sign of good design is how the performance of the amplifier varies with level and frequency:Each line pair of the same color (solid and dashed) is at a different frequency.  An ideal amplifier would not care about frequency so all the graphs would land on top of each other.  Here, they vary some but much less than some other amplifiers I have measured.ConclusionsThe B&K AV30.2 provides competent performance across suite of measurements.  It runs cool, is efficient and small.  It easily outperforms mass market AVRs for example.  Alas, there is not a lot of power here so other than desktop speaker application, I would seek out something more powerful.Overall, I am going to put the B&K AV30.2 and by implication, the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE on my recommended list for mid-level performance amplification.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The demands by the Pink Panthers seems to never end.

      " Niles SI-275 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The SI-275 is discontinued.  But since it is sold to the custom integration channel, they come up used and in working orders (companies pull out gear wholesale to redo homes).  I am told it can be picked up as low as US $100 to $150.  I see one on Amazon for US $230.  But there is a used one on ebay for $100.The look is fine:I like the tall feet on amplifiers to allow for more air flow.  A massive heatsink goes the full width of the unit with beefy transistors.  Love the fact that it has two trim resistors to balance the gain in both channels.  So annoying that these days balance controls are impossible to find yet amplifiers routinely have gain that is different in each channel (causing slightly shift in imaging).Back panel is simplicity in itself:In use, the SI-275 was solid as a rock.  Never shut down.  Never complained even when fully clipped.  The top of the unit barely got warm despite using traditional class AB amplification.  That large and heavy heatsink does a great job of spreading the heat load.  Nothing remotely like flimsy heatsinks in mass market stereo amplifiers or audio/video receivers.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our dashboard:Notice the perfectly matched channels.  SINAD is middling but is actually better because distortion is near -100 dB.  It is pulled down by power supply noise which due to being low frequency is not very audible.  Using what we have, performance is slightly above average:Noise performance follows the same standard:Frequency response is dead flat in audible band and extends way up:The wider the bandwidth, the more challenging the design (if not done well, the amp can oscillate).  Power into 4 ohm is healthy:Allowing for 1% THD+N, we get even more:8- Ohm power is:Response with bot loads is very controlled with no oddities.  Amplifier was stable as soon as powered on and performance did not change much after running for a few minutes (not shown).ConclusionsThe Niles SI-275 is made for abuses of custom integration channel which routinely stuffs amplifiers in places they don't belong (i.e. lack of circulation/cool air).  Its construction is well beyond today's mass market product.  Measured performance is just above average.  Combine these with prices as low as just $100 and you have a great deal.I am happy to recommend used Niles SI-275.  Bargain shoppers rejoice!  ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.I know...

      " SMSL SA400 switching desktop power (speaker) amplifier.  It was sent to me by the company for testing and costs US $660.The SA400 is a powerful amplifier yet it comes in the same compact SMSL package and UI you would find in their desktop amp:Amplification is provided courtesy of ST Micro STa516BE.  The marketing material for SA400 shows a digital feedback but I don't see that in the ST specs.  I am not clear if this is an addition by SMSL or it is part of ST amplifier chip that they don't talk about.  Either way the input to the amplifier is digital so even though we have analog inputs, they need to be digitized to be used internally:A resonant LLC switching power supply provides the heft juice needed to drive this amplifier in a small package.  Bluetooth input is provided as well as a subwoofer output with low pass filter.  In addition, tone controls are included using a dedicated JRC chip.There is an informative temperature measurement you can turn on which I did as you see in the picture above.  With normal music listening (one channel) the unit stay pretty cool.  In testing however, the case got fairly warm and the display indicated 58 degrees C.  I suggest not stacking anything on top of SA400.One issue is a mechanical whine from an internal coil.  I can hear it even when nothing is playing from about 1 foot or so.  When testing at higher powers, this became much louder but when playing music, you won't be able to hear it most likely.  SMSL SA400 MeasurementsThere are three gain settings but performance is very similar between them.  I adjusted high gain for 29 dB which is my standard (defaults to 30 dB):For the rest of my testing I used the adjusted high gain for better comparison to other integrated amps adjusted the same way.Distortion is around -90 dB but what pulls down SINAD is the rather high noise floor.  This causes the overall ranking to be just slightly above average:Indeed we can see the noise issue in our SNR measurements:State of the art amplifiers get 16 bits of dynamic range at 5 watts so we are two bits short here.  Even at full power you are adding noise to a 16 bit signal (you want your amp to be cleaner than the noise in the source).  This, and the fact that there is no bandwidth above 20 kHz nukes any idea of playing high-res content:Sure would have been nice to use an ADC that was running at 48 kHz, not 44 as it seems to be.  Use of the ADC is likely the reason the noise floor is higher than it would be otherwise.  We have seen this in AV receivers which likewise digitize their analog inputs (unless you put them in \"native\" mode).There is some very good news though. The feedback for the amplifier is taken post filtering which means it can compensate for the interaction between that filter and the load.  The above measurement shows actually two graphs: one at 8 ohm and the other, 4.  Both land on top of each other showing the amp doesn't care which is great.  We only see this in the best class D amps like Hypex Ncore and Purifi.Crosstalk was very good but unpredictable:You can see the normal trend in the other two amps (dashed lines).Most important test for any amplifier is how much power we have and how much distortion and noise so let's look at that at 4 ohms:This is a powerful little amp, producing nearly 500 watts of power especially if you allow some peaking:It complies with the spec which I think is 220 watts.  Power naturally drops at 8 ohm but still healthy:On our last test which is power versus distortion+noise at different frequencies.  The output was quite unique:I have not seen a power amplifier show this level of frequency independence.  Yes, having only 20 kHz bandwidth helps but still, even linear amplifiers don't produce such dead straight and sameness the SA400 is producing.  This is quite excellent.Note that the the amp went into protection at both 20 kHz and 20 Hz in this sweep.  Alas there was no indication on the display. I had to power cycle the unit to get it to work again.SMSL SA400 Amplifier Listening TestsEven though I listen to every headphone amplifier, I only do so rarely for power amplifiers.  I decided to start doing listening tests with this amplifier which was a good thing.  I used an Infinity 253 speaker for my testing.  Despite driving only one channel, the SA400 drove the R253 with extreme authority and clarity.  Tons of detail and dynamics with little else to wish for.  Putting my ears next to the tweeter I could hear a slight hiss but a few inches away it would disappear.  The sound was so enjoyable I am still listening to it as I type this!ConclusionsSMSL brings us an interesting and unique power amplifier to us.  Love the load independence and small packaging plus tons of power.  Performance drops to average levels in some areas but nothing that appears to be faulty or poorly engineered.  I guess my one reservation is the cost.  I am not sure how much of this is temporary given the world order with component shortages, high shipping costs, etc. but to me, the better retail target would be $499.  The warranty is short at 1 year as well.  For DACs and such I am not worried about warranty much but for amps I do like to see longer warranty.Overall, I am going to put the SMSL SA400 on my recommended list.  It delivers tons of power with no weak points. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Crown DCI 4 | 300N four channel DSP and networked professional amplifier. It was kindly purchased (used) and sent to me for testing and costs US $3,511.There is only a power on/off on the front. I wish there was a processing bypass as well. The full capability is visible on the back:I wouldn't be able to scratch the surfaces of all that this amplifier can do.  Suffice it to say you can do full processing (speaker and to some extent room EQ), environment/remote control, and transmission of digital audio over Ethernet type cabling.  Configuration is available using Audio Architect software.  Typical of these Pro applications, it takes a bit of effort to get used to its operation but after that, it seemed easy enough to use.A rather loud fan turns on during power on testing and then goes off.  Alas, during my testing it came back on.  Unless the amplifier is way away from your listening spot, better plan to put it in another room/dedicate closet.Connections are all through screw terminals. Not so bad for speakers but for balanced/unbalanced input, you are going to need to have bare wires (upper right phoenix terminals).  Not the end of the world but don't expect to buy and power on the same day if you don't have these bits.I was disappointed with the trim controls in the back.  They are very coarse and hard to adjust to an exact value.  And being on the rear makes it harder to manipulate.  For its intended application of professional installation is not a big deal but for one-off testing/use, is more work.I chose to test channels 3 & 4 as my standard setup is stereo.  During use, the amplifier case did not rise above ambient but again, the fan was running the whole time.Note: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and we move probably more Crown amplifier than any system integrated on the west coast.  So feel free to read bias into my subjective remarks.Crown 4|300N Amplifier MeasurementsUpon power on, output noise+distortion was quite stable which is nice:So on to our 1 kHz dashboard @ 5 watts into 4 ohm load:I must say, I expected much worse performance!  Distortion is below -100 dB and SINAD as a result, is dominated by noise.  As is, performance is a bit above average of many amplifiers tested to date:As noted, noise floor is somewhat high causing SNR at 5 watt to be below desirable level (90+ dB):Using default settings (which is how I conducted all of these tests), this is our frequency response:I was surprised to see the response not being flatter at 4 ohm.  Still, we are talking about less than 0.5 dB.  Importantly, there is slight change with load change to 8 ohm, indicating small amount of load dependency (which you could correct using DSP subsystem).Multitone yet again displays the low levels of distortion:Crosstalk is better than most amplifiers I measure:We have healthy amount of power into 4 ohm:And get even more when we allow 1% THD+N:Switching to 8 ohm load, we naturally get less but there is still good bit of power on tap:I was disappointed to see distortion rise though above 1 kHz as power increased:On the positive front, there is not much impact at 20 Hz so you can comfortably use the amp to power subs and such.Finally, turn on and off behavior is very good:Do notice the long time to turn on though (nearly 20 seconds).ConclusionsNice to see that as we go up in price performance of a pro amplifier improves as well.  No, it is not state of the art but this combination of four channels with sophisticated DSP and audio streaming is not easy to find in consumer domain.I am going to put Crown 4 | 300N amplifier on my recommended list.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Behringer NX1000D power amplifier with DSP.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Can't tell if it is discontinued or not but see it on sale at one place for $299.  Retail cost is $549.I am a fan of orange displays and NX1000D delivers on that (sorry my sample is not powered on):What I am not a fan of, pun intended, is the super loud fan that stays on all the time.  I walked away to go to the bathroom and was so surprised that I could hear it from very far distance in the house.  Unless you can put it in a sealed cabinet, I don't see it being useful for hi-fi use.  Maybe you can modify it to quiet the fan or make it temperature sensitive. On the positive front, I really liked the look and feel of the control app that talks to it:The only thing I did not like about it is that it is not clear when some processing is on or off.  For example above, is the peak limiter on or off???The back panel shows SpeakOn connectors:And of course combo XLR/1/4 inch balanced inputs.  You can bridge the two channels although I did not test this configuration.  The \"1000\" designation is for total amount of power available.  As you will see, I was not able to come close to that in stereo use with 4 ohm load.Behringer NX1000D MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is average performance as amplifiers go:But it is good for pro amps.  SNR falls in the same category:Best in class amplifiers produce 96 dB at 5 watts and we are pretty shy of that.  So be mindful of background noise you may get out of your speakers if they are sensitive.Frequency response thankfully is load independent as the company advertises: Due to inclusion of DSP though, your bandwidth is severely cut to that of 44.1/48 kHz sampling.  So \"no high res sampling for you!\"Crosstalk was surprisingly good for the class:As I hinted, power delivery into 4 ohm is way under specifications:Even allowing for 1% THD and burst mode, we can't get to the company spec:How did they get their 300 watt number?  Using car stereo \"standards?\"Power drops quite a bit into 8 ohm:Just 78 watts in a pro amplifier???  This is AVR class amount of power, not what you see in this class of product usually.Multi-tone test shows distortion increasing at both low and high-end of the spectrum:We see the same in our power testing versus frequency and distortion+noise:Notice how the 20 Hz distortion rises unusually what way.ConclusionsWe, the home users, look to pro products to get more wattage on the cheap.  Behringer unfortunately doesn't give us that here.  Instead, it saddles the product with a loud, non-temperature sensitive fan which rules it out of many applications we may have for it.  So I don't think it is a fit for what most of us want out of an amplifier even though there are some good qualities like load impedance independence, DSP, low cost, etc.As is, I can't recommend the Behringer NX1000D.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " five channel Classe Sigma AMP5.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and originally cost US $5,000.  I see one on ebay for $1,900 right now.This is one heavy amplifier for a class D architecture:At first I thought it had a linear power supply and its transformer was the reason behind the weight.  Alas, looking into other reviews and pictures inside, it uses a switching power supply.  So all the weight is from the enclosure and likely the very thick front plate.At first I was hoping that the glossy front where the logo is, is an LCD display with VU meters and such.  But there is not.  It is just for looks.  I must say as high-end products go, it is not that attractive to me relative to the high cost of the enclosure.  It has sharp corners which is not nice.The back shows quality selection of parts:I like the staggered speaker binding posts which makes it easier to plug things in.  XLR connections is what I like to see in an amp in this price range and we have them.  This amp was mated to their processor of the time which I suspect is discontinued longer than this amp.Amplifier MeasurementsI tested two channels (Ch1 and Ch2) using XLR input.  Here is our dashboard:Rather high second and third harmonics dominate causing the overall ranking to be middle of the road:Nice to see precise channel matching though.Frequency response showed unexpected results:Researching I found out there is an analog to digital converter which explains the sharp cut off.  I thought that meant DSP functions but there is none.  Instead, the digital signal is used as part of a protection circuit.  I can see that as a parallel path but not as the main path compromising the response this way.  This amp came out in 2015 so it is not like we didn't have higher sample rates available then to at least go up to 48 kHz and get us flat audible response.Signal to noise ratio is middle of the road as well:Crosstalk is \"OK\" but should be better:Power vs distortion shows odd response at 4 ohm which gets worse at 8 ohm (see later):Very strange noise response at the start and the multiple sources of distortion take over, each causing their own non-linearities. On the positive front, we have healthy amount of power.  Not much more is available though in burst mode (typical of class D amps with their regulated power supplies):Here is power into 8 ohm:That step function is quite bizarre. Worst measurements came when bandwidth was increased to 45 kHz and frequency sweeps were used:No way this amplifier is so well behaved.  Instead I think there is high amplitude noise that is masking any distortion present (until clipping).  We can see that if we perform a wideband frequency analysis:We see sharp increase in noise right above audible band.  This is either caused by noise shaping in the ADC, the Amp or both and explains the previous graph.There is naturally switching spikes (near 400 kHz) but I am disappointed that its level is just 8 dB or so below our fundamental.  I like to see 20 dB or more attenuation. ConclusionsThis is a custom Class D design and switching power supply from Classe.  It clearly shows deficiencies of the design and creating a market for Hypex to come and show how class D is done.  Digitizing the input is not a good idea if there is no user benefit to it and there is none here.We could get depressed about the above or look at copious amount of power this amplifier produces while remaining cool (a bit above room temp in testing).  Since lack of power is the #1 reason amps sound bad, I am going to put enough emphasis on this as to not give it a failing grade.Overall, I am neutral on the Classe Amp5.  At current sale prices, you have about $400 per channel for 400+ watts of power.  It may be hard to match this with Hypex amp so you decide if it is worth it or not.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Have not been to the garden for a week as I have been busy with our septic tank issues.  Nor can we preserve anything because we can't use any water in the house.  So here is a picture at the start of our harvest season:This is the first year we had good success growing corn.  Had so much that we couldn't eat it all and some became starchy. You see our most prized and delicious pears in there too.  They turn that pink/red color and are the most delicate, juicy and sweet pears you have had.  Alas, the tree produces at least a couple of hundred and they go from being barely ripe to overripe and useless in a week or two.  We ate and canned a bunch.

      " Schiit Vidar stereo amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Vidar costs US $699 and nicely comes with a five (5) year warranty.  With amplifiers being one of the most susceptible audio products to failure, long warranty is a real value.The Vidar sports the usual design style of Schiit which in this form factor is attractive:Despite its narrow width, the Vidar is quite heavy as it uses a linear power supply and class AB amplification topology.Back panel connectors are fine but I always miss balanced inputs in audio products:During power testing and such, the Vidar got fairly warm but not too hot and typical of the category.  It only shut down once when I ran a sweep causing it to clip at 20 kHz.I only tested the unit in stereo mode and not bridged.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone delivering 5 watts into 4 ohm load:We see the typical power supply noise spikes to the left and right of our tone.  SINAD (measure of noise and distortion) is dominated by second harmonic distortion though which rises to -80 dB or so in the worse channel.  As it is, performance is a few notches above average of some 85 amplifiers tested to date:Signal to noise ratio and crosstalk follow the same ranking:Frequency response is excellent though:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important aspect of an amplifier is amount of power it can deliver cleanly.  Let's start with 4 ohm load:We are getting 183 watts which is a bit shy of the 200 watt specification.  But that is at higher distortion.  If we allow that, we get there as well:Unlike class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, class AB amps like Vidar have much higher peak performance for short duration as you see above right.Using 8 ohm load we actually beat the company spec:Finally, the difficult test of power versus distortion versus frequency:Nice to see these lines without any strange curves and overlap.  This indicates there are no hidden dragons in the design of Vidar, just a standard degradation with frequency.ConclusionsSeems that Schiit set up to design a straightforward Class AB amplifier with lots of powers and no design flaws.  In that regard, it succeeds.  You have an attractive amplifier with long warranty and lots of power into 4 ohm load.  At US $699, it is priced well.Overall, I am happy to recommend the Schiit Vidar.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Let's agree that no one does a better job of begging for money than I do.

      " Parasound 2125 V.2 power amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $899.The 2125 has an understated look with just a few touches to keep it from looking boring. The only controls in front are for which set of speakers it drives.  There is more however in the back:For those of you wanting to use it with a sub, it has selectable high pass filter of 20 or 40 Hz.  Trigger is supported as well as bridging.Parasound 2125 V.2 MeasurementsI had a heck of a time getting stable ratings in the dashboard with channel 1 mostly going nuts on its own. I thought this was a grounding problem so tried many things.  There was hardly a difference.  It was not until the power measurements that I realized something is going on the amp in the 5 to 20 watt range.  Anyway, here is our dashboard when both channels were behaving:Measured noise+distortion lands the 2125 above average ranking:Noise performance is not great at 5 watts but naturally improves at full power:Multitone reflect the average distortion rating:Frequency response is very good:I was however surprised that gain dropped when I activated the high-pass filters.As noted, my first power sweep had instability in mid power.  I thought this was instrumentation error so I filtered the heck out of it and got these:On reflection though this was amplifier instability as we can see when I sweep the frequency:There is a frequency dependent hump in distortion which is very strange.  It is likely due to some kind of voltage rail switching.There is a lot of power available though in a cool running case:ConclusionsThis kind of performance would usually garner my recommendation for the 2125. On reflection though, I am worried about increased distortion in the \"sweet\" area of power band -- 5 to 20 watts.  Company needs to work on mitigating this issue.  So for now, I won't be recommending the Parasound 2125 even though it checks many boxes from value to functionaltiy.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Class D Audio (the company) CDA-250C Power (speaker) Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The CDA-250C costs USD $495 from the company direct which barely sneaks it into affordable class.There is not a whole lot to look at on the face of the unit:As you see, the unit is made in USA.  I suspect the case is generic Chinese though given the DIY look and feel it has.The power button is oddly in the right side of the unit.The back panel sports very large speaker jacks which is nice:Unfortunately there are no balanced inputs even though the holes seem to be made for them.Another miss is lack of any safety or regulatory certification.In testing, the CDA-250C ran completely cool.  I could not feel slightest rise in temperature of the case whether I touched the top, left or right, which is really good.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard at 5 watts of output:I was pleased to see the unit working well enough to allow me to measure it down to DC and hence the DC offset.  Many recent switching amplifiers make my analyzer go crazy if I DC couple of it.SINAD (signal over distortion and noise) is rather low and seems to be driven by high noise floor than distortion products (which are below 100 dB).Signal to noise ratio is disappointing:We can't even clear the CD's 96 dB at either 5 watt.  We barely get there with 200 watts of output (which is already pretty distorted).The news gets pretty ugly when I measured THD+N versus frequency at six different power levels:We have multiple problems here.  At both low and high end of the frequency spectrum we have rising noise and or distortion.  The higher the power, the worse they get.At low power outputs (around 1 to 2 watts), low frequency noise seems to escalate which may be due to power supply noise.To top it all, two channel are wildly different than each other.  One seems to be a lot more susceptible to noise than the other.Let's look at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone with wide bandwidth and see if we can figure this out:I should have run this without my external filter but let's run with it anyway.  We see our usual spikes in hundreds of kilohertz due to switching frequencies.  But we also see a rise in noise around 50 kHz or so.  The previous test uses 90 kHz bandwidth so this peak will impact the measurements.  Note again the channel mismatch.Let's rerun the previous test, this time by limiting the bandwidth to 22.4 kHz.  Note that this means that we can't capture anything past second harmonic for the high frequencies (hence the reason the levels artificially drop there):The graph becomes somewhat cleaner especially at low output level (in red).  But otherwise, the signature issues with distortion/noise remain.Let's run our typical power versus distortion test.  Note that 1 kHz tone is used for this test so doesn't incorporate the issues we see above:We have good bit of power reaching 178 watts into 4 ohm before clipping sets in. FYI, I have refined this test to give us more resolution near max power so it is a bit unfair to previous products I tested.  Still, this is quite a bit more power than the two reference amps in the graph.When I get a chance later, I will test the output impedance versus frequency.  And a frequency response test which I just realized I forgot to run too.  ConclusionsGetting nearly 200 watts/channel into 4 ohm for a US made power amplifier for $500 is not bad.  Outside of that, you have to close your eyes to many flaws.  These noise and distortion issues way dwarf anything upstream.  As such, I don't see the Class D Audio CDA-250C in any kind of high fidelity system.  Our search will continue for something with Hypex NC400 performance but at half the price.Needless to say, I can't recommend the CDA-250C but you can judge it for yourself and your application based on above data and decide.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Sometime a man just needs money for really no obvious reason.

      " 3e Audio SY-DAP2002 stereo desktop DSP amplifier with Bluetooth.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  I will also do a teardown and test with upgraded op-amps.  I went to look up the price just now and it says no longer available!  I think it was US 116.The enclosure is heftier than is typical for the class:A cute set of white LEDs rotate around the volume control when first turned on and then indicate volume level.   An unusual twist for this class of amplifier is inclusion of mains power supply:No figure-8 power cord was included however so I have to supply my own.  As you see, there is a little fan to help with cooling but it never came on during my testing.  I had the top open and touching the heatsinks showed that they were pretty cool which explains the fan staying off.Note that while there is a DSP subsystem, I did not test it.  It is based on \"Sigma\" ADAU1701 platform which I already reviewed. Amplification is provided using the ST Micro TPA3255 chip.SY-DAP2002 MeasurementsI started my testing using stock configuration:Distortion is quite low at -95 dB however SINAD is way worse at just 72 dB indicating noise as the limiting factor (SINAD is sum of noise+distortion relative to signal).  Don't be confused by the -100 dB noise floor in FFT.  That is after some 35 dB of \"FFT gain.\"  The owner had warned me about the noise and indeed had gone ahead and purchased the recommended upgrade opamps, the LM 4562.  I took the top off and swapped both and performance indeed improved:Noise still dominates though so performance continues to be average:You can see the effect of noise in SNR tests:Here is the comparison of noise with no input signal with or without the op-amp upgrade:Frequency response is limited based on digitization and load dependency:Crosstalk was generally good but somewhat variable:Multitone test shows how low the distortion is, alas with high noise floor:Healthy amount of power is available before shut down:Because of aggressive protection circuit, I could not get to 1% THD to measure max or peak power.Good bit of power is available at 8 ohm indicating that the 4 ohm performance above is current limited:Transfer function is quite good for a switching amplifier:SY-DAP2002 TeardownOverall construction seems reasonably clean:Top row is the switching power supply which naturally has high-voltage rectified mains in it.  As such, I would have liked to see a routed slot in addition to existing isolation that exists on the PCB.  That would reduce the chances of arcing from high voltage side to the low voltage amplifier.Capacitors are lower grade as usual but at least all the ones I looked at are higher grade 105 degree C.  The heatsink is quite beefy for its size and seemed to do its job keeping the TPA3255 chip amp cool in my testing.  I am not sure the fan will do any good since it likely pushes air in but there are no vents to push air out.  High static pressure then reduces its effectiveness although likely it is better than nothing (if noise is not a problem).I did not like the Bluetooth antenna lead travelling from the front of the board to the mains side.  The noise from switching power supply may reduce Bluetooth range and at any rate, it is not a safe place for it should the lead come off and touch the high-voltage areas of the power supply.  The RCA cables could have been moved a bit up (in the picture) and made room available for that in the low voltage section.I see no regulatory and safety certifications which is not good in mains powered gear.Overall, this is not nearly as bad as it could be.  ConclusionsGetting a DSP platform and top-flight chip amp and power supply in a small box takes good bit of effort.  Overall, this is not a bad platform but compromises are there with performance dropping below what the chip amp can do.  Personally I use DSP upstream so have no use for it in the amp in this configuration so the performance hit (if due to that) is not good in my book.  But you can decide otherwise.I could have recommended the amp but seeing how I had to upgrade the op-amp to get good performance, I am going to pass.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Rotel RB-1070 stereo power amplifier. It was released in early 2000. Can't find the cost then but I see it used for around $400 to $500.I have always found Rotels to be most attractively designed power amplifiers.  One look at that front panel and you immediately think of muscle and beauty in design.  Alas, the extruded aluminum in front which gives it that look, is cosmetic.  There are two others internally which do the job of cooling this classic AB design.  In use the heastsinks got pretty warm to touch to give it some air to breath.Not much news in the back other than nice inclusion of trigger input/output:Rotel RB-1070 MeasurementsThe unit warmed up nicely without its performance changing much:So let's see what our dashboard of 1 kHz tone does into 4 ohm load:The amp is about 2 dB more sensitive than usual which likely accentuates the power supply noise a bit.  I was able to reduce 60 Hz hum in one channel but not simultaneously in the other.  That is exceeded however by the power supply noise at 120 Hz and multiples.  SINAD is likely dominated by distortion to the tune of -80 dB.  This lands the RB-1070 slightly above average of all amplifiers tested:Despite the power supply noise, dynamic range is very good:Frequency response is excellent and spec compliant:Crosstalk is good:Multitone shows no frequency dependence which is nice:There is ample power available into 4 ohm:The response is quite odd in that it doesn't slope down.  Don't know if that is intentional, accidental or due to power supply caps aging, letting in more ripple as power goes up.Regardless, lots of power is available:Company only specs the power into 8 ohm at 130 watts.  It certainly delivers that:Putting aside noise floor which is rather high, the units transfer function is one of the best I have ever seen:Sadly there is a significant power on pop:ConclusionsAs one of my favorite (looking) brands, I was very anxious to measure a Rotel amp, hoping it would not let me down.  Fortunately it did not.  No, the SINAD doesn't break new ground but the rest of the measurements are very good with plenty of power available.  It is a great choice for people wanting good amount of power in an attractive package with competent performance.I am going to recommend (used) Rotel RB-1070.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Outlaw Model 5000 five channel home theater amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  Despite the number of channels and power of each, the Model 5000 costs only US $649 though shipping adds fair bit to it.The shipping is expensive because this is thing is super heavy.  It is at the limit of what I can reasonably carry upstairs to my lab (50 pounds):My back nearly got killed just rotating the darn thing in my photo booth:Sadly, as you see, there are no balanced XLR inputs.  You are given heavy binding posts though which is nice.Left and right channels are far apart which is the right away to do it as they, and the center channel get beat the most.  And is most logical layout in my book.In use the Model 5000 never complained, shut down or anything of the sort.  The heatsinks are below the top cover so you can't exactly feel their temps.  I would imagine it would shut down though if it got too hot.Not much else to talk about so let's get into the measurements.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Nice to see the gain at 29 dB which is the only recommended standard in the wild (from THX).There is fair amount of mains hum and power supply noise.  I improved them a bit with messing with grounding but this is the nature of the beast when a linear power supply is used.Distortion is dominated by second harmonic which combined with noise and hum gives us a middle or the road SINAD:Speaking of noise, there is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and near full power:I like to see 96 dB or better at 5 watts to clear the dynamic range of the CD but we don't get there.  At full power though, we meet that target and a bit more in the good channel.Frequency response is basically flat in the audible band:Testing with my simulated speaker model did not change the response hardly at all:Crosstalk was good as it should be in modular amplifiers like this with independent amps:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important deal with any amplifier is its power versus distortion and noise so let's start with 8 ohm load:Nice to see the Outlaw 5000 completely outclass our NAD AVR both in much lower noise, distortion and available power.  The picture is almost the same with 4 ohm load although distortion rises:These are two channel tests.  Adding two more 4 ohm loads power drops a bit naturally:That is over 800 watts delivered into the load which is great.Back to two channel power, here is what we get with short bust (simulating what you may get in music) and more steady state -- both at 1% THD+N:The toughest test I run is power versus frequency while trying to achieve 0.1% THD+N. The amp has to deliver its output while being stressed the entire 3 to 4 minutes the test runs.  Many AVRs quit.  Not so with Outlaw 5000:As you see, it not only passed the 2 channel test, but also 4 channel.  A quick statistical analysis of my high-res music library shows highest peaks at 40 Hz and that is where the cursor is.  We are getting 252 watts at that frequency with two channels and 207 watts with four channels.  Yes, it is lower than 1 kHz peak I use in other graphs but still a lot of power.ConclusionsDespite its bargain price, the Outlaw Model 5000 is solidly built and delivers tons of power without complaining.  It provides a clear setup over the built-in amplifiers in home theater AVRs.  No, it doesn't deliver state of the art distortion and noise.  For that, you will have to pay a lot more money.  For what it is, it is very good and I am happy to recommend the Outlaw Model 5000.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Feeling pretty poor after spending so much money on Christmas.

      " Douk Audio H7 stereo class D desktop amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs US $144.Right away we see differentiation in the form of the nice looking VU meter.  Not only that there is a control to set it sensitivity which is a must in my view. The backlight is nice and bright and goes well with that yellow/orange ring.  The case is machined aluminum so feels nice and heavy for its size.  The switches and controls are surprisingly robust and impart a feeling of quality.  In other words, this is in entirely different class compared to typical budget desktop amplifiers.  Surprised continue to the back side:Yes, we have real, full size XLR inputs!  Of course there is also RCA input but they also added a set of RCA outs.  I am assuming that is to connect subs and out but there is no internal filtering.The heart of the unit is TI's TPA3255 single chip stereo class D amplifier with very lofty specs:Wide input range is provided. Included power supply is manageable with 32 volts output with 5 amps of current.  If you are going to drive higher impedance speakers and you want to go louder, you may want to up that to 48 volts.One negative which actually follows some \"high-end\" gear is dual volume controls.  Yes, to increase or lower the volume, you have to crank both of them. I would have wanted to see a single volume control with a balance knob.  As is, you can set them once and use an upstream DAC with its volume control (and remote).  That is how I tested it by setting the gain to 29 dB and treating it as a power amplifier.  You can see the position of the volume controls in the picture for that gain setting.Douk Audio H7 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm load using XLR input:The SINAD of the good channel at 82 dB is above average for all amplifiers tested.  But for some reason the other channel (in blue) is distorting more which drags the average down some:Zooming in:Noise performance is quite good for class although short of the TI specs:As is typical of budget class D amplifiers, the frequency response varies with what load (speaker) you connect to it in treble region:This means you may hear brighter or softer sound depending on exact impedance of the speaker. Best to use EQ and tailor that to taste.Distortion is kept very low at 5 watts:The less good channel lost 1 bit here (not shown).  So still quite good and more than enough for the application.Crosstalk is very good for any amplifier let alone a budget one:Let's see how it does in power department starting with 4 ohm load:This is good bit of power and only gets better if we allow 1% THD:I ran this three times as I could not believe it breaking into 3 digit department!  200 watts out of this little box?  Granted, the test is short term but still, that is quite healthy.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally get less power:Note that most speakers are around 4 ohm in bass frequencies where most of the volume is so don't go optimizing for this unless you know you have an 8 ohm speaker in that region.EDIT: forgot originally to post the power vs frequency:There is only a dB or so impact due to warm up (one channel getting better and the other, worse) so I would just turn it on and use:Finally, there is likely to be some audible pop on both turn on and off:Kind of strange to see the blue channel die out that way.  This may have something to do with that channel also underperforming in the dashboard.I had no luck trying to test the H7 with my powercube reactive loadbox. It caused some kind of interference that would keep it from switching loads.  Will need to spend more time investigating what is going on.ConclusionsThe Douk H7 breaks new ground in multiple areas from nicely done VU meter, nice looking case, and very good measured performance.  The only issue is if you can live with dual volume controls.  I am happy to see such differentiation in this highly price sensitive and crowded market.I am going to recommend the Douk Audio H7 amplifier.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      "This is a review and detailed measurements of a DIY combination of ICEpower 200AC and 200ASC in a Ghent audio case.  It was kindly supplied by a local member.  Total part cost is US $310.The case work is fine:I like the hefty power switch which also acts as protection circuit indicator.  Speaking of that, it is of nice variety that self-resets and doesn't require manual power cycling.The back panel sports far better connectors than you could get in any mass market amplifier:And of course balanced inputs.The internal amplification for one channel is provided by the ICEPower 200ASC which has an integrated switchmode power supply.  This in turn feeds power to the amplifier-only 200AC module.  Nice and clever!ICEpower 200AC MeasurementsLet's run our usual dashboard into 4 ohm:Having been spoiled by high performance class D amplifiers, this is somewhat of a letdown.  Distortion is dominated by third harmonic at around -78 dB which sets SINAD to the same rating.  Result is average performance among all amplifiers measured to date:Signal to noise ratio is good though:Frequency response is as well:Power into 4 ohm though show early rise of distortion:Disappointing to see performance be worse than some of the worst AVRs we have measured at the limit.  Same is true at 8 ohm:Even when we allow distortion to rise to 1%, we still don't get the rated 200 watt power:The power supply is the limiting factor likely.Sweeping the power range at different frequencies gives us very complex response:The lines going backward are caused by the amplifier going into temporary shutdown.  This is occurring at just 40 or so watts at 20 kHz!  Fortunately there is not much music power there but still, from engineering point of view, I like to see far cleaner and stable response.  In some cases SINAD is rising to below 50 dB at just 2 watts!ConclusionsAs usual, we have high efficiency and compact packaging of class D amplification here.  What we don't have is performance that matches or beats good class D amplifiers.  Of course the cost is much lower as well (compared to higher performance class D amps).  So you have a trade off to make.  I am too much of a perfectionist to want to recommend this unit but depending on what you are using it for, it may be fine.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Emotiva BasX series A-500 five channel home theater amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The A-500 costs US $529 which seems reasonable given the functionality and ratings.I can't say that I find the A-500 attractive but is not ugly either:Here is the connectivity which sadly does not include balanced XLR connections:This is a Class AB amplifier with a rather larger toroidal transformer.  It is not overly heavy though which my back appreciated.The heatsinks end well below the top of the case so it was hard to judge how warm it got by touching the case.  A quick test with IR temperature sensor showed the heatsinks running around 50 degrees C.In use the A-500 never complained, shut down or go into thermal protection.  This is nice benefit over the delicate amplifiers in AVRs which if you look at them wrong, they go into protection/shut down.  Clearly this is much more robust solution.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts output:I was surprised by two things: large channel disparity with respect to distortion (SINAD) and very high mains hum at 60 Hz.  No amount of playing with grounding fixed the latter which tells me the 60 Hz is probably induced from the transformer into the amplifier section.  The former, channel distortion parity varied with which channel you used.  Channels 1, 2 and 4 were very close and good.  Channels 3 and 5 lagged way behind.  The \"good channels\" had their SINAD actually dominated by that mains hum and power supply noise, not distortion (red channel).   The situation was reversed for the \"bad channels.\"Averaging all the channels we get a middle of the road score:Signal to noise ratio reflected the above issue with a-weighting resulting in substantial improvement of SNR:Our threshold of heaving in low frequencies is quite high so this is not as big of a problem audibly as it is in measurements.Frequency response was very good, almost ruler flat in audible band and going beyond 100 kHz at -3 dB:Crosstalk between channels 1 and 4 were rather disappointing:It is closer to a $29 amplifier than our state of the art Benchmark AHB2.The meat of the review is power measurements versus distortion.  So let's get into that at 8 ohms:Nice to see the massive improvement relative to a higher end AVR (NAD T758) but as soon as distortion takes over, that advantage is sadly lost.  We do get a few more watts though than our AVR.Here is the same measurement with 4 ohm load:Let's sweep from 20 kHz to 20 Hz and see how much power we get with THD+N set to 0.1% (barely or not audible distortion):We see a small drop in power at the extremes which is good.Some of you have been demanding that I work harder and measure performance with more than two channels.  So here you go:I could not get the amplifier to distort less than 0.1% with 4 channels regardless of output level. So I stepped that up to 0.2% to get the third graph.  I could have been watching a movie instead of running these extra tests so I hope you are happy!ConclusionsThe Emotiva BasX A-500 seems to be a decent shot at building a 5 channel amplifier for a very decent price.  Yes, it is a bit of a gamble how good each channel is, and how audible that mains hum can become.  Other than that, it is a definite step up very amplifiers in AVRs.Overall I can recommend the A-500 if you are on a budget and have a bad back stopping you from lifting something heavier.--------As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.Do you work on weekends?

      "This is a review and abbreviated measurements of the Linn Majik DS-1 integrated streamer and amplification.  It is on kind loan from a member.  It has been discontinued but back in 2010 (?) when it was announced it was US $4,200.  I see a recent ebay sale for a bit over $1,000.The Linn is an attractive unit:The interesting bits are in the back:You have full suite of analog and digital inputs although given the age, USB input is lacking.  Roon remote is built into the networking which is very nice for an older device.  And of course you have full amplification in there for a single box solution.Streamer DAC Stereo MeasurementsSince there is line out, let's use the Toslink input into its DAC and measure what comes out before the power amplifier:By today's standard, this is definitely subpar with sum of distortion and noise relative to signal not close enough to beat the CD format:I tested streaming with Roon player and performance was identical which is good.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started testing the power amplifier by using the Toslink optical input first:We see sum total SINAD of 78 dB.  This obviously is NOT limited by the DAC as it produced 20 dB better performance.  Indeed switching to analog input we see that confirmed:As its, the DS-1 lies smack in the middle of rankings of all the amplifiers we have tested regardless of price (nearly 120):I quickly ran a frequency response test using analog input and was quite surprised that it was not flat:Thinking it may be digitized, I switched to digital input with both 44.1 kHz and 96 kHz sampling:We see the same curve.  So unless there is some kind of EQ I don't know about, it is sad to see such roll off.Let's measure power into 4 ohm:This is very little power for all but secondary use.  It naturally drops lower with 8 ohm load:And these are not \"good watts\" either given how early distortion takes over and flattens the curve and then swings up at clipping.ConclusionsIn 2010 this kind of functionality would have been advanced.  But today there are a range of streaming solutions with amps that retail in hundreds of dollars with much more power.  It is disappointing to see an engineering focused company like Linn target so low in power and noise and distortion.Anyway, even at $1000 I can't recommend the Linn Majik DS-1.

      " Behringer A800 Class D Stereo Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The A800 costs US $299 including free shipping from multiple sites.The member who loaned it me has done a youtube video of it which you can see by clicking on this link.Behringer has been in this game for a long time and it shows from high level of optimization of weight, size and robustness of the A800:The unit is quite shallow relative to its width. Standard gain controls are provided which go up to 30 dB (for balanced input).  Nice set of LEDs show the output level including clipping indicators.  All amplifiers should come with such displays (with switch to turn them off).  I could do without the notches in the volume control though as they are fake (they are fully analog) and made exact setting harder (it would creep into the notch).  Not a big deal though.Back panel shows nice set of connectivity:For my testing I focused on XLR input only and standard speaker banana connectors.The amp hardly radiates any heat and has no fan.  Given the pro application of these amps, I expect them to be robust and reliable.During measurements, the A800 provides high level of predictability and assuredness that I sometimes miss when testing switching amplifiers.  It only shut down once after fair bit of experimentation at full power.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a gain of 29 dB to deliver 5 watts into 4 ohm load:This performance is very close to the Behringer A500 which I reviewed before.   That amp though, generated much worse SINAD because of its non-switching power supply:Its distortion products are capped to -80 dB which is what we see in A800.   Eliminating those power supply components sharply improves SINAD which is relative to sum of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is \"OK:\"Don't use it on sensitive speakers you may hear some hiss (although turning down the gain may help some).32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows early rise in distortion with frequency:Crosstalk is reasonable:Dual, 19+20 kHz tone shows very high level of intermodulation distortion as we saw in multitone test:Fortunately your music doesn't have such high amplitude tones and threshold of hearing is high that I don't think this is nearly as much of a problem for the ear as it is for the eye.Frequency Response MeasurementsThe necessary low pass filter is causing some peaking at 20 kHz to the tune of 0.5 dB:The above is with a resistive load.  I have been asked frequently how the amp performs with a real speaker.  Stereophile uses a simulated load of a 2-way speaker that was given to them by NHT.  I built a similar load based on schematic from Doug Self:Here is the impedance of my load versus frequency:My response is more damped in low frequency than what Doug Self and Stereophile show.  I will investigate this further but for now, it is close enough.  Here is the phase response:And Stereophile graph of the two:Using my simulated load this is what I get with A800 amplifier:As you see, there is hardly any difference.  Looking at stereophile graphs, they use highly zoomed version to show differences.  This is what happens when I do the same:So a bit of ringing becomes apparent but it is so small as to not be of any consequence.  Heaven knows your speakers are not anywhere close to this level of variation.I will test some of the other amplifiers I have with this load and see if it causes more variation.  As it is, resistive load is the same as complex one.Note that neither my load, nor stereophile's are high power ones.  So I cannot plot full power graphs and such.  Above measurements were at 5 watts.Amplifier Power MeasurementsGoing back to our resistive load, we get this output with 4 ohms:The show starts well with A800 being much quieter than our premium brand NAD AVR.  But then distortion kicks in and we don't do as well.  We get however tons of power nearly a quarter of a kilowatt.  Similar story holds for 8 ohm load:Still, that is a lot of power at 8 ohm leaving our AVR way back in the dust.Using 1% threshold for THD+N, we get more power naturally than my graphs above indicate:Left hand is short-term burst power, right side is long term.Thermal StabilityPerformance improved just a bit after 10 minutes of warm up at 5 watts:So you don't have to leave it on for good performance.ConclusionsThe Behringer A800 does what pro amps try to do: provide solid, middle-of-the-road distortion and noise with tons of power in quiet and light package for little money.  The design is stable and better than the A500.  As such, I can recommend the A800 as an everyday amplifier.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.You all asked for more amplifier tests and you are getting it.

      " Wyred4Sound mINT integrated stereo amplifier and DAC.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,499 from the company.  I see reviews dating back to 2013 so the box has been around for a while.The design goes with the rest of Wyred4Sound gear although in person looks less refined than I expect in this price range:The back panel shows some very good functionality such as triggers and home theater pass through:The overall package is small and convenient from that point of view.  It ran reasonably cool which was also nice.As I took this picture, I realized USB only goes up to 96 kHz which is the old school USB interfaces of the time.  Fortunately it is asynchronous which was novel at the time and could have been worse in the form of synchronous USB.Wyred4Sound mINT MeasurementsWhen I first powered on the unit, the measurements were low so to make sure it was not my setup, I took the time to route all cables separately tightened all the connections and performance seemingly improved.  But this morning I got up and thought maybe the box was warming up and changes had nothing to do with the wires so ran my standard warm-up test:Looks like my guess was correct.  The amp did not stabilize even after 7 minutes of running with load on.  I waited at least that long before I took the measurements you see below so represents the warmer side of things.  With amplifiers with both digital and analog inputs, I always have to determine which input is best which depends on topology of the amp.  So let's do that here, first using Aux In analog input:I tried hard to suppress that mains noise at 60 Hz but every change made it worse.  I then switched to USB input:Man, this is bad.  It should be a walk in the park to have  DAC that keeps up with an amp that has a SINAD of 77 dB but here we are, with one of the worst performances I have seen with digital input.  So let's continue with analog input for the rest of the tests starting with our SINAD rating:So below average and disappointing.  Even more disappointing is the high noise floor:Crosstalk is fine:Frequency response unfortunately shows variability which means the class D amp used doesn't use a feedback loop outside of its filter to remove that dependency:Assuming you have good high frequency sensitivity, this amplifier will sound different with different speakers.We see that distortion sets in early and rises a lot:Here is our peak and max power at 1% THD:Sweeping different frequencies shows reasonable response for a class D but not in general:ConclusionsI very much like the functionality of the mINT with cute small size.  Performance though is subpart and much better can be done than what we have here with discrete parts which may cost even less than this combo.So I can't recommend the Wyred4Sound mINT.  But if you are fond of the functionality, I am not going to chase you out of the room .-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Jeff Rowland 535 stereo (bridgeable) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  I believe it costs US $5,900.If you are not familiar with Jeff Rowland, it is a high-end audio company, known for their gorgeous machining of their cases that imparts a 3-D look.  You can see that coming through the protective film which I chose to leave on:The unit is incredibly heavy for its small size.  The back panel shows the most unusual binding posts I have seen:Those big knobs rotate to tighten bar on two spade terminals.  The feel incredibly nice.  Alas, they don't mate with banana leads and I had to screw around to connect mine.The amplifier is said to be balanced throughout including input transformer which is made with wire from Cardas (!).  Company only states that a switching power supply is used but says nothing about the rest of the functionality.  From my testing, it seems to be class D which would explain why the amp stayed completely cool to touch under testing as if it was never on!  The massive chunk of chassis aluminum is likely responsible for great thermal performance.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz dashboard at 5 watts into 4 ohm:Ah, this is disappointing.  Distortion peaks to -80 dB which sets SINAD at an average number of 77:This is way below stated of the art in switching amplifier design.  Company specs are similar by the way so this is representative performance as designed.Where specs don't match is in signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk curve usually gets worse with frequency (due to increased effect of stray capacitance) but here it is rather flat:Frequency response is very good with no indication of interaction with the load:Another shortfall from the spec is in power department:Letting distortion peak up to 1% still doesn't give us what the spec says:I don't know how they get to 500 watts unless it is at even higher distortion levels.As a way of comparison, let's see how the power curve looks like relative to noise and distortion of Hypex based NC400:We have slightly more power although the NC400 I tested had a shared power supply.  That aside, there is no comparison in noise and distortion department.  The 535 way underperforms the Hypex.Finally, here is an unfiltered output of the amplifier at 5 watts:We clearly see the switching waveform.  Attenuation is better than 30 dB which is more than a number of other amps I have tested so that is good.ConclusionsThe Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier has beautiful fit and finish.  And is solidly engineered to run cool and I am sure reliable as a result.  It produces good bit of power which should be able to drive many speakers to desired loudness.  Alas, it reinvents the wheel and makes it less round.  Any amplifier based on Hypex modules will have as much or more power with far less noise and distortion and lower cost.Bottom line, I can't recommend the Jeff Rowland 535 due to its high cost and average noise and distortion.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Every online reviewer begs you for money.  What sets me apart is that I spend quality time and energy finding something lame and sarcastic to say about it!  So please donate to me using : @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Fosi Audio TB10D stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and is only sale for US $70 on Amazon including shipping.We have the typical compact desktop aluminum case. Controls feel nice for the class.  Tone controls are not centered however for flat response (you can see in the picture what I set them to). Typical of these budget amplifiers, power is provided externally through a switching supply:Binding posts are spaced out a bit more which made it easier for me to plug in my large cables.This is a class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 single chip amplifier.Fosi Audio TB10D MeasurementsLet's start with our usual 5 watts measurement of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:Dominant distortion is third harmonic which essentially sets SINAD to same level. This is slightly below average but considering the price of this amp, it is reasonable:Kind of interesting that the $5,900 Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier lands almost next to it!Signal to noise ratio is modest but again, good for the class:Crosstalk holds its own against much more expensive amplifiers:Frequency response is variable due to bass and treble control and load dependency:The load dependency is the norm in this class.  Hopefully some amp comes along and with no cost penalty takes care of that (by incorporating the output filter into the feedback loop).Distortion rises with frequency which we can see in multitone test:Power is everything in amplifiers so let's see how much we have:This is quite healthy for such a small and low cost amplifier!  It gets even better if we allow 1% distortion:We are talking essentially 200 watts coming out of this little box!  Cost per watt is just 35 cents.  Amazing.Even with 8 ohm load we get good amount of juice:Amplifier \"transfer function\" (output vs input) is very good for class D although it does show rise in distortion as noted earlier:Of note, you still have 66 watts of power at 20 Hz.  Many budget amps drop to 20 or so watts which can be problem as bass is what requires power.ConclusionsMaybe one day this will change for for now, in under $100 range you can't expect perfection in performance of a stereo amplifier.  What you do want to see is delivering healthy amount of power with close to our average of all of our amplifiers tested to date.  On that front, the Fosi Audio TB10D delivers. If you need an amplifier for secondary use (bedroom, workshop, etc.), the TB10D is a very good candidate for no more money than one or two dinners!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio TB10D amplifier.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " SMSL A100 A100 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member. I can't find it on sale anywhere but seems to have cost US 100.I like the simply but rather elegant/symmetrical design.  Same for thoughtful rear connections:Almost every manufacturer puts both speaker outputs together making it so hard to plug in the banana plugs. Here they are spaced apart which essentially solved that problem. Inclusion of an AC power supply is unheard of in this price class and nicely declutters your desk.Oddly the USB input is type A.  At first I thought this was for external storage but manual talks about using this with a computer.  I didn't have a type A to type A cable so didn't test this and stuck with Aux analog input.The heart of the unit is Infineon MA12070 class D amplifier.SMSL A100 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Distortion is actually better than 90 dB but there is rising level of noise and high order spikes which drag it down to 76 dB.  This puts is slightly below average:Edit:Request was made to measure using USB input.  I had to use a special breakout box to interface to the unit given its type A connector.  Here is the dashboard:As you see, performance is degrade fair bit.  My breakout may be causing some clock jitter but then again, if async USB is implemented, this should not be the case.Noise performance is \"OK:\"Multitone shows the same problem at high frequencies:I expected frequency response to have load dependency but thankfully, it did not:What ringing it has is above audible band which is good.Crosstalk is very good, beating some home amplifiers:Power output is naturally modest:Sensitivity to high frequency input becomes very clear as we do power sweeps:Unit didn't need any warm up.ConclusionsThe message here is a sum of good and not so good.  I really like the frequency response for a class D amplifier and inclusion of AC power supply.  Distortion on the other hand rises with frequency.  I like to see perfection but we don't have such an example below $350 currently.  Overall I would say not a bad attempt.  Strange that despite having become available late last year, it is discontinued already.  Maybe there are part shortages.I am going to recommend the SMSL A100 as a budget amplifier.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      "This is a review and detailed measurements of BasX A-100 Class AB amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me for testing.  The A-100 costs US $229 from the company direct.I must stay, this is one gorgeous looking and nicely feeling amplifier:This is a deep cabinet ending in the terminals in the back:As you see it has trigger capability.  Not a fan of the figure 8 AC mains cable as I have very few of them.  Best to not lose it.There is a fan on top but I did not hear it come on.  The unit does get quite warm though so allow ample cooling/space above it.Emotiva BasX A-100 MeasurementsAnother member had contacted me asking me if I could test if the unit was distorted while cold.  I had stopped testing for this since the warm up effect has been so minimal.  Not so here:You see what I am seeing?  12 dB improvement in distortion after 5 minutes???  I am assuming bias is not optimal while cold but why? Temperature compensation is quite cheap and has been part of design of amplifiers forever.Anyway, here is our usual dashboard:Not happy about the channel gain difference.  As it is, performance is a bit below average:I like to see a dynamic range at 5 watt approaching 96 dB and we are fair bit short of that:Frequency response is flat enough:Crosstalk is pretty good for a budget amp:Here is the multitone:Power versus distortion+noise is good:If we allow 1% THD, we get the power spec from the company:Distortion characteristic has a simple relationship with frequency and that is it:ConclusionI really like the packaging and price of this amplifier.  While overall performance is good, having to wait 6 minutes before it stabilizes is just not acceptable.  I would be tempted to buy this and mod it to make it temperature stable.As is, I can't recommend the Emotiva BasX A-100 amplifier.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Argon SA1 integrated amplifier with phono input and Bluetooth. It is on kind from a European member and costs €369.I have a soft spot for white audio electronics and the SA1 goes right after that!  Quite elegant. What I didn't like is the lack of indication on the file LEDs which indicate inputs. The volume control is digital (also controlled via an included remote). Pushing it selects the input.  The LEDs also blink for other reasons I did not try to figure out. Here is the  back panel:It was odd to see just a type A USB that is indicated as USB power.  There should be proper USB input in this day and age. There is pre-out but in my testing, I found that the volume control did not adjust it when using digital input but did with phono. Maybe this was operator error, I don't know as only a single half-sheet of instructions is provided with the unit.The unit as shipped is for 50 Hz/250 volt so I used my lab AC generator to power it.  Specifications say \"40 watts\" of power so thought my 300 VA lab supply is enough.  As it turns out, it was not.  See the measurement section.FYI, there is a very clos cousin of this unit from NAD in the form of AMP1. I could not find either for sale in US.  The AMP1 lacks Bluetooth I believe but has Chromecast built in (?).  It is not clear who built this unit.  Likely it is an OEM for both.Argon SA1 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit Toslink and measured from the pre-out.  The output was severely clipped.  So I brought the input level down -12 dB to our nominal 2 volts and no clipping:This lands the unit in the middle of our \"fair\" category:I like to see a SINAD of over 100 dB for this class product and we are good few dBs short here. Here is the response sweep of digital input levels:Our dynamic range is just \"OK:\"At this point, the picture of the DAC performance is clear so I thought I cut to the chase and measure the amplifier.Argon SA1 Amplifier MeasurementsWith amplifiers that have both analog input and digital, I start by testing both to see which is more transparent and run with that.  Here is analog input:This is not a happy picture with rising low frequency noise and distortion that is just below -80 dB.  Let's try Toslink input:Ah, that is much better.  The combination of noise and distortion is well above average now:So let's continue with Toslink input starting with our SNR:We are a few dBs short of my 96 dB requirement for 5 watts but 88 dB is not so bad. I expected crosstalk to be better given the digital input:Frequency response shows some load dependency in this Class D amplifier but better than many with this problem:Let's see how much power we have starting with 4 ohm load:Multitone performance is good:I could not get to clipping range as my AC lab supply would shut down.  So likely there is more power to be had as you can see in this dynamic test:I did have enough juice to run the 8 ohm test:In both cases the SA1 beats the ARCAM AVR10 in noise which is good.Argon SA1 Phono MeasurementsThere was tremendous amount of mains interference in the phono stage dashboard.  I am not going to show that as it may be due to use of my lab supply.  But here is the all important RIAA equalization:It seems to be a little heavy handed in upper bass with a rumble filter built-in.  Not bad but not perfect either.ConclusionsI really like the way the SA1 looks.  But looks can't get me over \"checklist\" DAC performance of around 16 bits.  The analog input on the amp doesn't perform well but digital does.  Overall I have mixed feelings on the unit so not going to pass judgement one way or the other.

      " Crown XLS 1502 \"PA\" Power Amplifier.  It is on a kind loan from a member who bought it new and drop shipped it to me.  It retails for USD $349 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.  At that price, it seems like an incredible value.I have to say, while the unit looks industrial/military, it does not at all feel cheap.  As expected it comes in 19 inch rack mount configuration but very shallow:Not only do you get a high power amplifier with front graphical display and such, but also a built-in DSP.  It is not a fancy subsystem but allows you to dial in crossovers and such which is very handy in live sound.   At may company (Madrona Digital) we use a ton of Crown amps not for hifi applications but for music distribution in the home.  The built-in DSPs come in handy for limiting the frequency range, max output, etc..Unlike home units, the XLS 1502 has a built-in fan with tons of holes for ventilation as you see.  Fortunately it is temperature controlled and barely came on during my nearly 50 watt soak time.  And when it came on, it was very quiet.Here are the guts of the unit (click on the image for larger size):Man, is this clean!  Look at the beefy mains chokes to keep noise at bay.  The power supply is integrated on the same board as the power amplifier so you can't swap one to fix the unit although at these prices, getting a new unit is more economical anyway.  The fan is placed not only in front of the heatsinks for the power transistors but also the output filter inductors which is nice as far as keeping them cool too.I noticed that the output stage is depopulated.  Seems then that the step up model just has a few more parts in it and that is that:There are tons of connectors in the back which I let you read about elsewhere.  Overall, this is jaw droppingly nice unit and unbelievable at the price that is being charged.I did a lot of searching and was surprised that there were no measurements of these units.  A lot of empty reviews, yes.  But no measurements.  So you get to have an exclusive set of data in this review!    So let's get into that.MeasurementsI started by cooking the unit for a while at 48 watts with kind permission from its owner:Unlike some other amps, bringing the unit up to temp ever so slightly worsens performance.  There are also some interesting thermal effects from time to time represented by the spikes.  Anyone who thinks they can predict what thousands of components do as they warm up should get into predicting the weather on tuesday next week, 10 years from now!  Anyway, let's look at our dashboard at 5 watts of output:Sorry I did not set the reference in the FFT.  But the news is there in the SINAD (signal over distortion and noise) of just 75 dB.  We have seen worse but also much, much better.  Gain is about 30 dB by the way.Signal to noise ratio is decent but again, nothing high-end about it:Let's look at power versus distortion+noise:So we see that the Crown XLS 1502 easily outperforms the no-name Chinese class D amp we recently tested (IRAUD350).  It has a well behaved response with sloping down curve and then onset of clipping.  Power was around 336 watts @ 0.008% distortion.  I say \"around\" as there are not enough points in these measurements to find the exact onset of clipping.  The number is therefore a bit understated.  Crown specs the unit at 525 watts though at 4 ohm and we are not going to get there without a lot of distortion.The hypex Hyped DIY Nc400 amplifier far outperforms the XLS 1502.  It has far lower noise and distortion although not as much power before clipping.  It costs nearly four times as much though.I thought I do a comparison against the Behringer A500.  The A500 feels a lot more cheaply made but is also priced at $199:We see that the Crown XLS 1502 is better in every regard with lower noise and much more usable power before clipping.I thought the continuous power would be a walk in the part for the XLS 1502 but did present a surprise:The red \"thermal\" light came on the front panel but instead of shutting down, the power was reduced a bit.  \"The show must go on\" seems to be the rule here and nice to see instead of full shutdown we saw with Hypex Nc400.   As you see, I let the unit keep going and it went to 8+ minute maintaining that status.Frequency response was surprising but easily explainable:We have a \"brickwall\" style filter which indicates our analog input is digitized first through an ADC running at 48 kHz sampling, processed through DSP (or not), and then converted back to analog before amplification. Both the ADC and DAC therefore sharply limit the bandwidth to 48 kHz.  I was surprised to see some roll off at 20 Hz too.Wideband FFT (without AES filter) as usual shows a lot of activity in higher frequencies:The first peak is very nicely truncated at a little less than 100 kHz to pass emissions standards (by 60 dB).  Crown class I devices interleave the output stages which would explain the energy spread over four quadrants at multiples of that ~100 kHz pulses.  Since the XLS 1502 has passed emissions standards I would not worry too much about them.ConclusionsIt is hard to fathom that a properly engineered and produced mainstream brand amplifier with so much power can be sold for so little money.  This is a robust but bargain amplifier designed for heavy punishment in live sound.  Can it be used for hi-fi use?  Sure but it will severely limit both the resolution and potentially bandwidth of upstream sources.  Its best use would be as a subwoofer amplifier.  If you need an all in one unit, Hypex NC400/NC500 designs are so far my choice among amplifiers tested.-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, or even if you don't but wish for me to escape the rain in Seattle and go somewhere sunny, please consider donating using:Patreon: orupgrading\n",
      " Outlaw Model 7140, seven (7) channel home theater power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 7140 seems to have come out a few years ago and is shown as discontinued.  At the time it was out, the cost was a reasonable US $1,100.  The new replacement series, 7000X looks just like this so not sure what they have changed.The 7140 is a beast of an amplifier, nearly breaking my back carrying it up to my lab:The design is highly modular with a massive toroidal transformer powering 7 independent amplifiers, each with their own power supply on board.  The heatsinks are rather beefy with plenty of distance between them and top of the unit.  The feet are also quite tall allowing better ventilation from bottom to top.The back panel shows the inclusion of XLR inputs which I appreciate:The inclusion of a grounding terminal was interesting.   It did no good in my testing with XLR inputs as it should not.During use, the 7140 was quite stable, never complaining, shutting down or anything as Audio/Video Receivers (AVRs) tend to do.  Clearly then this is a more robust solution than internal amps in those units.Power Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard view of 5 watts into 4 ohm load using a 1 kHz tone:I was surprised to see such high mains hum at 60 Hz.  A prior review of another unit with just RCAs complained about the same thing and recommended a ground terminal on the unit which they have added.  But as I mentioned, it made no difference.  I have to think this is magnetically coupled into the amplifiers.Fortunately or unfortunately the distortion spike from 2nd harmonic is bit higher still so didn't impact measured SINAD (combination of noise and distortion relative to our main tone).  As it is, the 7140 lands below the average for all the amplifiers we have reviewed so far:Frequency response is flat enough:32-tone signal to resemble \"music\" shows the typical rise of distortion with frequency:And rather high noise floor which could be caused by that power supply hum.Here are the noise figures for 5 watt and full power:We are not clearly more than 14 bits or so at 5 watts so not very quiet.Here is our power versus distortion and noise at 8 ohm:We see the elevated noise and distortion relative to our reference amplifier.  Power produced is right on the money at 146 watts.Here is the same at 4 ohm:The above tests are at 1 kHz.  Here is what happens when we sweep the frequencies, aiming to measure power at 1% THD+NQuite a drop in power with both loads when we get down to 20 Hz.  The power supply capacitors are likely too small to keep up with the slow rate of change at low frequencies.We see a similar view when we look at sweeps at different frequencies:Finally, some people like to see intermodulation distortion of 19 + 20 kHz tones so here it is at max power:ConclusionsThe Outlaw Model 7140 has a very sturdy build.  It produces good power per specifications provided from manufacturer (at least in two channels).  The down side is too much ground/mains leakage and distortion+noise that is slightly below average.  Paying more (a lot more actually) will get you sharp reduction of such problems.For typical home theater duty, the 7140 should do the job fine.  It just isn't something to get excited about from pure performance point of view.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Folks, I was not kidding when I said this amp nearly killed my back to carry it upstairs to my lab.  To keep testing these things, I need to get one of those staircase elevators old people put in.  And that costs serious money.

      " Sound Town ST-UPDM4C four (4) channel professional amplifier. It was purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me. It costs US $540.As you see, there is a bit of style to this amp with the front panel.  This is a straight amplifier with no DSP:The fans came on immediately and made moderate amount of noise (much quieter/lower pitched than many small fans like this).  As you see, input is XLR and output is speakon connectors.I was very pleased to see Audio Precision analyzer graphs in the manual.  They were quite tiny and hard to read but made me hope that the design was verified through such.Sound Town ST-UPDM4C MeasurementsThe tests you see are all performed using Channels 1 & 2 on one side.  Let's start with our dashboard:SINAD is below average of all amplifiers tested by 4 dB but for a Pro amplifier, it is not bad:But there is more going on here.  There is broad set of noise between 2 and 4 kHz.  I shut off the signal feed to it and was very surprised to find this noise component:Seems like some square wave with harmonics buzzing around internally that is bleeding into the amplifier.  Not good.That noise limited the signal to noise ratio:It also showed up in multitone test:Notice how the ends of the spectrum has reduced levels which indicates non-flat frequency response:Not only do we have (speaker) load impedance dependency but we are missing the lows as well below 40 Hz or so.  As such, you can't use this amplifier for subwoofer duty.Amplifier is rated at huge wattage so I was shocked to see so little output with 4 ohm load:I am used to seeing power exaggeration in pro amplifier specs but this is in entirely different class.Strangely, I got identical amount of power into 8 ohm load:Is there some kind of limiter in the unit?  There must be.  See what happens when I change frequencies:See how the curve goes up but then starts to go backward below 1 kHz?  That is electronic limiter in action.  Finally crosstalk was very poor:ConclusionI have hardly seen any audio device show issues in every test I run but here we are.  I don't understand what is going on here.  How can they have analyzed the performance using AP yet have so many issues left on the table?  Did they design change post those measurements?  This is the frequency response from the manual:It shows flat response to 20 Hz.  Notice the date is 2003.  Is it really that old of a design?Anyway, I can't recommend the Sound Town ST-UPDM4C. -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " PS Audio Sprout100 integrated DAC, headphone and power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Sprout100 is an upgrade over the original Sprout and costs USD $599.I remember the first time I saw the Sprout at an audio show.  I thought it was utterly cute!  It is small and handsome little package with a ton of functionality:As you see, in addition to functions I mentioned, it even has Bluetooth included.  And moving magnet turntable input.  It is a dream product for a frustrated marketing guy in a high-end audio company like PS Audio, wanting mass market product that appeals to the \"younger audience.\" The volume control is a rotary encoder with a built-in switch that powers the unit on and off.  If you hold the button down, the LED color changes from purple to white, indicating bass boost is on.  The rotary encoder is poorly programmed to have linear and slow response, making it very, very slow to change volume.  To go from low to high volume you may have to turn it seven or eight times!  We live in a digital age with music that is fast to access and comes at all levels.  Having the ability to quickly change volume is important.Input selection is old school mechanical selector.  I like the clear labels.The backside shows how much is crammed in there:I did not test sub out but it has sensor that automatically activates that output (and rolls off the mains?).In addition to USB input, we also have toslink optical which is nice in case of ground loops.The nicest bit is included power supply in such a small package.  Kudos for managing to fit that in there and reduce clutter.There is protection circuit for both power amplifier and headphone.  During testing I found it to frequently activate which simply turns off the unit.  It caused a lot of head scratching until I discovered the latter action.It is also I think underdesigned from cooling perspective.  When I started my DAC testing, I had the dummy load connected to the unit as well.  After a few minutes of testing I noticed the signal went away.  Then I realized per above it had shut down.  Went to touch the power button and it was hot as heck.  As was the rest of the enclosure which was super hot.  Even the top \"wood\" panel was hot to touch.   I would not rely on the 100 watt rating into 4 ohm to be a continuous rating for any length of time.The Sprout100 is rated at 100 watts into 4 ohm and according to PS Audio uses ICEPower modules.I should tell you that I hate testing multi-function devices like this.   Every subsystem takes as much time as reviewing another product with just that functionality.  In the interest of getting the review done, I did not bother to test the Vinyl input.  I also did not touch the sub out or toslink.DAC MeasurementsThe inclusion of line out allows us to test the DAC subsystem independently so let's start with our dashboard there:The output was variable so I adjusted it to 2 volt.  Per my review notes above, the power amplifier was on and was whaling away into the dummy load at the same time.PS Audio rates Sprout100 as having less than 0.01% THD+N distortion from line out.  We are beating that although that is such a low bar.  Equivalent rating in SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) puts the Sprout100 in our bottom quarter of DACs reviewed:Not a good place to be although probably fits the performance target they created for themselves for \"lifestyle product\" like this.Back to our THD+N rating, we can separate the components of distortion and noise and get this ratio:They are both contributing to the final THD+N but the noise is a bit more dominant.  Likely in this small enclosure the could not get enough isolation for the DAC subsystem to reduce noise levels.The high noise level makes the jitter graph \"pretty\" with almost no spikes visible but that is because the noise floor is so elevated:Best in class DACs put that noise floor down to the bottom of the graph.Same noise problem manifests itself hugely in linearity test:That smooth, exponential rise indicates random noise polluting the voltage reading at each level.  Noise-free performance then stops around 80 dB or 13 bits -- quit a bit shy of 16 bit performance of CD.  In this day and age, I like any DAC to at least do justice to CD format, bringing fully transparency to 96 dB.Intermodulation test shows similar higher noise floor but also pretty early rising of distortion levels:Similar story for THD+N versus frequency:Dynamic range of the DAC is as spec'd:Speaker Amplifier MeasurementsNote: all amplifier testing except when noted, is with an AUX-0040 Audio Precision filter in place to reduce high frequency components given the fact that this is a switching amplifier design.As usual, for amplifiers I test with 5 watt output.  The trick is to know what to use for input level and volume control.  With digital input that was easy as I set the level to 0 dBFS.  But then I thought we want to know the performance of the amp alone so we better test with analog input and here is what I got:With digital input I could get over 80 dB by the way.  But no combination of input and volume level could get us there with analog input.  In some sense then the amplifier is good enough for the performance of the DAC.Frequency response showed different response in each channel:I swapped my loads and the curve did not change, indicating that the variation is due to the amplifier (filter) design, not differences in my loads.  Clearly the channel in blue is resonating around 50 kHz, causing that large boost of nearly 20 dB!  What you get with your speaker load and its wiring is unknown.  The red channel is more behaved.  We saw the same discrepancy between channels in the SINAD in the dashboard.Poking our noise into the design using high-bandwidth spectrum (FFT) analysis, we see this:Note that this is a raw test with the external filter removed.  We clearly see the switching frequency around 600 kHz peaking up to almost -20 dB.  You can have your own AM station if you like.    We have an early rise in noise before 100 kHz which is due to some kind of noise shaping.  There are a lot of other spikes which one could examine to see what is going on but I am too lazy to do so.  Regardless, these amplifiers are not pretty to look at as far as performance above audible band.  It is the price you pay for having 100 watt/channel amplifier squeezed into a little box.Speaking of power, let's measure that into 4 ohm load:We get 82 watts with both channels driven which is shy of the 100 watt specification.  Noise and distortion is lower than Topping TP60 ($200) amplifier.  And there is more power.Signal to noise ratio is \"OK\":Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet's jump right in with power versus distortion and noise at 300 ohms:We have competent level of power but much more noise and distortion than our reference Topping DX3 Pro ($220 when not on sale).  I like to see at least 100 milliwatts here and the Sprout100 delivers.Here is the picture at 33 ohm:We have 420 milliwatts of power until the Sprout100 shuts down causing the graph to shoot back to the left.  In other words, the unit is distortionless until it shuts down.Output impedance is a bit high at 5.7 ohms:Headphone Listening TestI started my testing with Sennheiser HD-650.  There was enough power there for a very good experience.  I could not detect any onset of distortion.Switching to Hifiman HE-400i, I got a bit more power and again, clarity and power until the end.Dedicated headphone amplifiers will produce more power but there was enough here with either headphone to give a bit of tingling to my ear lobes during bass so I was happy.  I could not get the Sprout100 to shut down with the HE-400i so in practice this may not be a serious problem.ConclusionThe reviews I read prior to testing the Sprout100 all point to how great it is that a \"high-end\" company like PS Audio has produced such a mass market product.  And that this association must be translating into excellent sound.  Our objective measurements show that this is not the case.  Performance of such subsystem as the DAC and headphone amplifier is nothing to write home about. Subjective aspects though are good: lots of power from the headphone amp and to some extent, from the power amplifier.The miss from usability is the super slow to change volume control.  In many cases I could move it a notch and nothing would happen to the output in my analyzer let alone the ears.So where do we land?  From objective performance I can't say that the Sprout100 lives up to the promise of the brand.  From full functionality point of view at $599 it seems to be there though although I have yet to test many products in this category.  For this reason, I am going to withhold giving or holding back a recommendation.  Let the data guide you in that regard.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The sun is out and temps are starting to rise so I need to buy seeds and planting soil to start our garden.

      " Crown XLS 1002 rack mounted pro amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  The 1002 costs US $339 including Prime shipping from Amazon.Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman and hence Crown products.  We use fair bit of Crown amps in custom installs usually to power in-ceiling speakers and such.  Member wanted to buy it through us but the margin on it was no more than a cup of coffee (relative to online sites) so I suggested he buy it elsewhere which he did.Not sure what to say about the look other than it is made to have some style while being rugged:The LCD with bluish backlight reminds me of displays on electronics back in 1980s.  I guess at this price they had to cut every penny.I was relieved to see binding posts besides speakon connectors:Now don't laugh but I could not figure out how to pull out the safety plugs they put in the darn binding posts!  There is no way to grab then and I did not want to put a mark on them by using a sharp tool.  The manual says only European units have it but clearly that is not correct.  Anyway, I resorted to using the SpeakOn connectors for my testing.  For input I focused on XLR inputs.I set the gain to max to get the nominal 29 dB I have standardized on for testing amplifiers.There is a fan in the back and some inside.  But none came on that I could hear above the sound of my PC during testing.  Nothing shut down even when the amp was pushed into clipping.  Some kind of limiter would kick in after short period to keep the power level at max.  Temperature of the case didn't even rise above room temp.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsPerformance was stable during a 5 minute warm up time so I ran with them:Strange to see higher order harmonics dominating the distortion profile (FFT to the right).  Ratio of noise+distortion to signal as expressed in SINAD is what I expect decent pro amps to produce:Slightly below the average of all amps tested.Signal to noise ratio is in the same range:Crosstalk is reasonable:Frequency response test shows that everything is digitized due to inclusion of DSP functionality in this amp:Power into 4 ohm is healthy as is the case with most pro amps:I was disappointed to see one channel be much worse than the other though.Letting distortion go higher we get higher power output:The burst/peak power is not higher because of the limiter I mentioned in the intro.Using 8 ohm load gives a more behaved response than 4:This indicates the one channel is starving for current than the other (likely longer path to the power supply).I was unhappy to see distortion shoot up at higher frequencies:Fortunately in practice there is not much energy up there so you will be operating in low wattage area where distortion is quite a bit lower.Finally, I removed my AES filter to get the spectrum:Switching frequency is around 380 kHz and decently attenuated.ConclusionsCompetent pro amplifiers target for good enough noise and distortion.  The Crown XLS 1002 falls in that category so if you were expecting to have anything better for so little money and so much power, you would be disappointed.  But otherwise the amp does what it targets to do.I am going to put the Crown XLS1002 on my recommended list for non-critical applications or for driving subwoofers and such.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The job last night after helping my wife can more tomatoes was to dehydrate these beauties:They are called \"blush\" tomatoes and were invented in San Francisco in 2011!

      " Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 Stereo Class D power amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $799 (recent price increase).The GaN 5 comes in a compact enclosure with plenty of ventilation at the cost of decent looks:Beside the sole power button and blue indicator, there are two red LEDs that turn on when you power the unit on and then go off.  Strangely, when the amplifier goes into protection, they do not light up and getting the unit working again requires a power cycle.  I like to see protection circuits that self recover when the extreme condition goes away.The back panel shows binding posts that are too close together for easy fitment of my large banana speaker cables.  But I like the inclusion of balanced XLR inputs:As you see, there are also jumpers to change the gain setting although the range is not very large (26, 28 and 32).  Most of my testing was with medium gain which is as shipped.I had trouble getting the amplifier to function initially.  It would simply not output anything.  I played with grounding as I have seen some very low end amps cause AP to not be able to capture their output due to high level of noise (despite my use of AES-17 filter).  This didn't work at first so I switched inputs to RCA.  That did not work either.  After some fiddling and switching back to balanced input, the amp all of a sudden started to work.  Not sure how much of this is interaction with Audio Precision or design issue.  Either way, it is an exception to the rule of 95% of amplifiers I have measured.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses the new Gallium Nitride transistors (GaN) which has some advantages over classic Mosfet transistors.  All else being equal, it can produce higher efficiency and better performance at expense of higher cost.Mini GaN 5 MeasurementsAs noted, I started my testing in medium gain which produced near nominal 29 dB which is my standard for amplifiers.  XLR input was used per introduction:Well, this is disappointing.  Distortion is fairly high causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion+noise to be worse than a number of budget desktop amplifiers:Noise performance by itself is not good either:I had trouble getting the amplifier to go to full power for the right graph.  It would shut down at just 0.7 volt input. Strangely, later on it accepted higher levels of input.  I think the impulse nature of this measurement was causing it trouble.  So maybe it can produce higher SNR at higher power but still, none of this is competitive.On the other hand, crosstalk was very good:Multitone performance was also reasonable:What is not reasonable is high dependence on speaker load when it comes to frequency response:This is just not proper.  Clearly the output filter is interacting with the load.Power measurements were quite puzzling:Notice the pull back due to some protection kicking in, likely the power supply rather than the amplifier.  I could not remotely get the power rating they specify using medium gain.  I thought maybe low gain does better but then the pull back occurred at even low power (blue and green)!  Beside lack of power, distortion is also quite high for this price class and category.  We are talking about poor Audio/Video Receiver amplifier performance!Switching to 8 ohm tamed the output a bit but power shortfall is still significant:This being the second amplifier I have recently tested with such power shortfall, I started to doubt my instrumentation.  So I pulled out my Purifi reference design and measured it.  It tracked the dashed line in the above graph from a year ago 100%.  Someone had posted this from their website:600 watts per channel??? Into 8 ohm?  This is the spec from the manual:How on earth did they measure 600 watts when the spec is 200 watts?  Strangely, that graph is nowhere to be found on their site.  There is some talk about a larger amplifier of which is a shrunk version?  Maybe that is the one that produced higher power but why does it say \"mini\" in the title of above graph?FYI, this amplifier has the green board which I understand to be the newer design.  Maybe the older red one had more power.  Hard to say.Anyway, I tried to run my max and burst power:In Burst mode, the amplifier would keep going into pull back and so I could not compute anything for that.  Likewise the THD+N vs frequency and power could not be run.  As the frequencies got lower and lower, the point where the amp would pull back would also shrink to lower and lower wattages.   What I could get did not show great transfer function.ConclusionsWhile I leave the door ever so slightly ajar to some interaction with Audio Precision, the measurements seem to indicate an amplifier that has both design issues and inability to meet specifications.  The fact that the company took away the only measurement graph makes it suspect that maybe they had have modified the design and selling something different than what they originally intended.  As it is, it is a waste of GaN technology as it brings nothing to the party but high expense.I can't recommend the Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 amplifier.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " \"upgraded\" TPA3221 chip based AIYIMA A05 integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $80 from Amazon including Prime shipping.For a budget amplifier, the controls feel nice:As you see, tone controls are provided.  Alas, there is no detent or switch for flat response.  If you center them, you actually get too much bass.  I had to adjust them using iterative measurements to settings you see in the picture above for flat response (see measurements later in this review).A giant external power supply providing 32 volts is included which dwarfs the size of the unit itself:I dislike these little speaker terminals but they are very common in this price class.  They are too close to each other to connect beefy locking banana connectors I use for testing.Bluetooth is provided which I did not test.In use, the unit never even got warm so efficiency must be quite high.  Or else, the heat is not transmitted to the case.AIYIMA A05 MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:SINAD is dominated by distortion and ranks below average of all the amplifiers tested to date:Still, for this price and category, I think this is pretty good.Signal to noise ratio becomes good at full power:Crosstalk is decent as well:Here is our frequency response with my adjustments of the tone control:As you see we get a typical peaking of the response when I change impedance to 8 ohm.  This is due to the filter in the class D amplifier interacting with the load.  Fortunately you have tone controls here so you can compensate for it.Multitone shows best performance in mid frequencies which is a good thing compared to the alternative:Let's see how much power the A05 can produce into 4 ohm load:This is much more than I expected.  We get decent amount of power even with 8 ohm:Above is with 1 kHz.  Let's see how it does when we vary that:Not pretty at either high frequencies or very low.  As noted, mid frequencies do well which is good as that is where we are most sensitive.  ConclusionsGetting decent amount of power and low distortion and noise is hard in ultra low price category but the AIYIMA A05 gets there.  So I decided to grade it on a curve and give it my recommendation.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Monoprice 150 watt \"605030\" rack mountable \"pro\" stereo amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing.  The 605030 costs just US $119 from Amazon including Prime shipping which is remarkably low.From a distance the unit looks like any other pro, R1U amplifier:It looks rather cheap an unattractive to me but hard to imagine any pro amp getting some kind of design award for their looks.Two gain controls are provided in the front which I appreciated.  For testing I aspire for gain of 29 dB and I almost got there at max level as shown.  That is how I tested the unit.  There overload indicators which was niceWhat I did not like one bit was the rather loud fan which runs continuously.  Monoprice, please take another $5 from me and make the fan temperature dependent please!Seeing balanced input in any amplifier at $115 price range is incredible but that is what we have here:Output is provided in the form of SpeakOn and mono 1/4 inch sockets.  Neither is convenient for in-home use but you can deal with it as I did.The loud fan did have one benefit: the amp never changed temps above the room after all my tests.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI powered on the unit and ran the dashboard and was immediately disappointed with the very high distortion:I checked all of my connections and distortion persisted.  I almost didn't run the rest of my tests but decided to do anyway.  As another 5 to 10 minutes passed, I noticed the performance had improved so I went back and re-measured the dashboard again:I have never seen an amplifier improve by 11 dB after brief warm up.  Some kind of thermal compensation is left out to save money I guess.  If the fan was not running, you could leave it running all the time but with the fan, I certainly would not.  Anyway, the ranking is still below average but at least not in the broken category:Frequency response shows anomalies in the filtering of the switching design:Depending on your speaker and its impedance, you may get accentuated highs.  There is also low frequency roll off which indicates likely capacitor coupling.Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about:Crosstalk is kind of average:Power versus distortion and noise into 4 ohm load shows unacceptable rise at higher power levels:We get the rated power and no more:Into 8 ohm performance is rather strange:Weird to see that smooth and gradual rise in distortion as if not much feedback is used.Sweeps versus different frequencies indicates the same issue as distortion rises with frequency:Finally, without my AES filter, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:Pretty ugly but levels are low and of course well above our hearing.ConclusionsThe cheap looks, loud fan, and lack of power for a pro amp was enough for me to dislike the Monoprice 605030.  Then I wondered what else you could get for so little money and there is nothing that comes close.  Hell, if this doesn't work as an amp, you would get your money's worth in the form of chassis, power supply, etc!Personally, I am too much of an equipment elitist to want to buy this amp.  I would pay more to get a quiet unit, with more power and slightly better looks.  But you all can decide as you want.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Still timesharing between doing reviews, working on the bloody broken dishwasher and picking ready fruit and vegetables from the garden.

      " Starke Sound AD4.320 four channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member new and drop shipped to me.  It costs US $1,499 but they have had sales with prices as low as US $900.The Ad4.320 looks a bit industrial and is quite heavy for a class D amplifier:The reason for heavy weight is dual linear transformers and power supply on the right side.  Usually class D amplifiers use switching power supplies which keeps the unit light.  My own switching amplifier also uses a linear power supply with its weight and size penalty.I was pleased to see balanced inputs and triggers for remote on and off:As you can see, you can bridge two channels together and get double the power.  Unlike other amps that require funky connections, you have two dedicated terminals with a slide switch to select the mode (which need to be activated when power is off).  When I powered on the unit, I could not get output out of one channel.  I switched the bridge mode left and right (when off) and it got both working.  For bulk of my testing I tested channels 1 and 2.Starke Sound AD4.320 MeasurementsWe start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a load of 4 ohm with power of 5 watts:Gain is atypically low at 21 dB (usually it is in 28 to 32 dB).  Not a problem with our dedicated DACs as they can easily provide the voltage the unit needs.  Sadly we have high 2nd and 3rd harmonics that cause SINAD to droop down to 73 dB. This is well below average of all amplifiers tested:We are talking chip-amp performance level here not anything that would come at this price range.Signal to noise ratio is better but not exciting:Multitone test shows rapid rise in distortion with frequency:The class D amplifier filter is not inside the feedback loop so shows high sensitivity to load:This means the tonality you get may depend on the actual impedance of the speaker you use.  Crosstalk between channels 1 and 2 is very good:Key performance metric for any amplifier is powered and I was very surprised to see far less power than specified:We are not even in the same planet with 104 watts vs spec  of 320!  I switched channel 2 to 3 just in case there is a power supply limit but it almost made no difference.  We are still way short of the company specs:Story repeated with 8 ohm load:Forgetting about lack of power, we also have very early rise in distortion and rising before clipping.I thought maybe they had used peak power to rate the amplifier but that is not in the same vicinity either:We do see the benefit of the linear amplifier in the way it allows higher burst power than tightly regulated switching power supplies.Sweeping the frequency and measuring power and THD+N, shows smooth lines which is good but they are quite elevated at higher frequencies:ConclusionsThe AD4.320 underperforms in so many categories.  You can argue about audibility of this and that measurements but not the lack of power. That, you will hear.  Is the unit broken?  Could be but it doesn't perform like it is broken.  I thought maybe it is set to 240 volts but it is clearly marked as being a 120 volt unit (see the back panel picture).  And at any rate, if they shipped the amp this way to a US customer, then that is what they are going to get.I can't recommend the Starke Audio AD4.320.  Getting four channels with so much power would have been a good value if they had delivered.  But when they don't, there is no reason to buy it.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Emotiva XPA HC-1 Monoblock amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $879.As the name indicates, this is a single channel power amplifier. I have a soft spot for monoblocks and the HC-1 hits it. I especially like the power button which has buttery action and nice orange color when you hit it. Alas, then it switches to the cold, trademark blue color of Emotiva. Wish they would switch to that orange!Note that the amplifier is *very* deep, probably three times as deep as it is high.  Back panel shows nice inclusion of XLR input which is what I used for testing:The design of the amplifier is Class AB with dual power supply rails in order to keep power consumption low at lower powers. It did that as the amplifier barely generated any heat during my testing.  I was not a fan of the protection circuit though as when it clicked in (during 20 kHz sweep), it required power switch in the back to be toggled.  I like self-resetting protection circuits and if that is not possible, have the front panel be used for that purpose.If you are not familiar with my amplifier measurements, I highly suggest watching this video on amplifier measurements.Emotiva HC-1 Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our usual 5 watt dashboard using XLR input:My eye quickly went to the high distortion products which sadly lands the HC-1 at well below average of all amplifiers tested:Even though SINAD is distortion dominated above, noise performance at 5 watts is not anything to write home about either:I like to see an amplifier above budget prices to clear 16 bit hurdle of 96 dB at 5 watts.  Or else, sensitive speakers may spit out noise.Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and good bandwidth:Multitone test patter shines a familiar light on the amplifier when it comes to distortion:In an attempt to have more common measurements with other sites, I decided to run the 19+20 kHz intermodulation distortion (although I don't know what power others use):Spray of intermodulation products around our dual tones don't paint a pretty picture.Let's run our power sweeps:We do have a lot of power but alas, that comes at the expensive of noise+distortion.  Allowing for 1% THD distortion, we do get a lot of power:Rail switching design (\"Class H\") shows distinct change in performance as that happens:Notice how distortion is lowest around our 1 kHz testing and increased when you go lower or higher in frequency.  The latter is kind of expected but not the lower.ConclusionsThe Emotiva brand is one of budget prices but with high performance.  Alas, after testing many of their products, the right message here is budget prices with slightly below average performance.  Company really needs to retool their products and bring up the objective performance up a notch or two.  Then they will have a winning formula.  As is, we see products like HC-1 here which underperform more than half the amplifiers ever tested (over 400).  Fortunately it is very powerful so likely sounds OK.I can't recommend the Emotiva XPS HC-1 amplifier.  It is an OK amp but we are not here for OK products.----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Rega IO stereo integrated amplifier with phono input.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $649 on Amazon including Prime shipping.  It is designed and built in UK and price there seems much more reasonable (379 pounds).The front panel doesn't do much for me:It is function though with a simple input switch and power.  The inclusion of remote control is a nice touch:Courtesy of the company heritage in building turntables, it has phono input built-in.  No digital inputs  which is an odd omission in this day and age.Rega IO Amplifier MeasurementsWith power amplifiers I let them run at about 5 watts into my 4 ohm load and watch their distortion+noise to see when it stabilizes.  It did not in the case of Regao IO and contrary to audiophile belief, kept getting worse!I watched every video review of this box while waiting but it would simply not stabilize.  At around 23:00 minute, I started to sense the smell of electronics running too hot so I put my hand on it.  That was a mistake as it darn near burned it!  The sides were quite hot.  I took an IR picture of it:As you see the left and right bars run much hotter with the back end being at around 45 degrees C.  This is in open air in cool weather where we live.  Imagine what it would do at higher power delivery and when put in a cabinet.  Not good.  Company provides lifetime warranty but says it won't include wear and tear.  Wonder if it cooks itself whether they repair it under warranty.Anyway, let's get on with our testing starting with our dashboard:A lot of things stand out.  For starters, the channel gain is not matched.  The mismatch seemed to be volume pot independent.  Then there is the matter of very high levels of mains hum and harmonics.  No matter what I did with grounding, it would not make any difference whatsoever.   The mains noise is actually higher in energy than the harmonics.  That is not a bad thing in that our sensitivity at lower frequencies is much lower than at higher ups.SINAD sums all the noise and distortion and lands the IO in the \"fair\" category:This is well below average of nearly 79 dB.Signal to noise ratio as a result is nothing to write home about:I was surprised that despite being a simple class AB design, it doesn't have flat response in audible band:Most shocking measurement was that of crosstalk:Here is our multitone test showing the impact of distortion:Company specs the amp at just 30 watts into 8 ohm and good news is that it delivers that:But this is not much power.  Here is what we get into 4 ohm:Thankfully being a class AB amplifier with unregulated power supply, it does better in burst mode:Modern speakers are built in compact enclosure that reduces their efficiency greatly.  I am not sure this is enough power.Here is our frequency stepped response:Class AB designs sport clean transfer functions and the Rega is no exception.  Typical of all amps though, you lose power at very low frequencies.  Usually you have a lot to loosing some is not super painful.  Here though, you don't so that is not good news.Phono Stage MeasurementsThere is no preamp output so I decided to use the headphone output to measure the RIAA equalization:Good showing here assuming you prefer less bass to LP rumble.Headphone Output MeasurementsCompany specifies the headphone output as having an impedance of > 100 ohm which is massive.  It will cause frequency response error in vast number of headphones which have variable impedance.  And on those flat ones which tend to be low, it will dissipate a lot of power internally:This is basically a checklist feature and not something that you want to use for any serious headphone listening.ConclusionsI have a soft spot for western companies trying to compete with Asian ones in budget audio products.  Alas, performance has to be there to do the job and for the most part, it is not with Rega IO.  Capability is poor as far as power output.  Measurements like crosstalk are horrid.  Headphone output is years behind times with super high impedance.  And then we have the large amount of heat this generates.  If this were a powerful amplifier I could understand idling high but not when all you have is 30 watts into 8 ohm.  Amplifiers have a tough life and you want them to be reliable.  I am not sure how long the IO will last given the elevated temps under which it operates.I don't know that this is a terrible amplifier but when test after test makes me cringe, I have no choice but to withhold recommendation for Rega IO.Edit: see teardown here: always,\n",
      " AIYIMA A300 stereo amplifier with balanced and Bluetooth inputs. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $177.I like that you can easily defeat the tone controls now and select one of three inputs, allowing the amp to replace a pre-amplifier as well.Especially nice is inclusion of power supply which is a rarity in budget/small amps:The speaker terminals are small but typical for the price class.I could see an aluminum heatsink in the box for the power device/IC.  In use though, it never warmed up above room temp.  Neither the top, or the bottom registered a temperature rise which is nice.AIYIMA A300 MeasurementsLet's start with unbalanced RCA input first, setting the gain to 29 dB as with other amps I test with adjustable gain:Switching to balanced we essentially get the same performance:That distortion spike at nearly -72 dB limits SINAD to below average:In fairness and comparison to a few amplifiers with much lower gain, I also tested the amp at 12 dB gain:A bit better but still not enough to cross the average line.  For the rest of the tests, I stuck with XLR input and 29 dB gain.Here is our SNR:These are disappointing numbers relative to what AIYIMA has shown it can do.Multitone test result is not too bad:Crosstalk is good:Frequency response unfortunately shows load dependency:Key here is to see if we can get more power out of this small package and we do:Interestingly, we get almost as much with 8 ohm load!Back to 4 ohm load, with short bursts we get a lot more power:Finally, there is little frequency/power dependency which is very good for a class D amplifier:Warm Up Time MeasurementAmplifier stabilizes quickly:ConclusionsIt would have been great if the A300 had followed the footsteps of previous AIYIMA amps but with more power.  Alas, it delivers on more power at the expense of noise and distortion.  Assuming you don't hear the noise, it may be the right trade off in a budget amplifier.  On packaging, I really like the integrated box with XLR inputs.  Amplifier power supplies can be huge and that is avoided here. I am personally snobbish and want my power with low noise and distortion so can't recommend the AIYIMA A300.  But your priorities may be different.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Crown XLS2502 DriveCore (switching) 2-channel amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The XLS 2502 cost US $645 including free shipping from Amazon.  It has DSP functionality which I did not test.  And is specified to drive 2 ohm load.From the outside, the XLS2502 is built like a tank:It is very light of course due to switching topology for the amplifier and power supply.  But also very sturdy with plenty of steel to keep its shape.The two gain controls are notched which gives them a nice feeling but the gain is not matched and is hard to get there using those notches.Here is the back connectivity:There is a fan as you see but in normal testing it never came up. During stress testing, it did come on but was pretty quiet compared to what I expected.  Mind you, I don't think you want it close to you if it is going to be running.Alas, the fan was insufficient to keep the unit cool under full power.  The red thermal indicators came up even though the fan was running.  The amp seemed to be functioning still but to be on the safe side, I terminated my testing there.  In typical home use, even for subwoofer duty, I doubt that this is a concern as you will see later as far as what wattage we are talking about.Overall, the impression of the amplifier is positive, making you think you have something made to be run over by a car and still function reliably.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:I set the gain to 29 dB for consistency.  I also tested it at 19 dB gain and it only made 1 to 2 dB improvement.  The reason is that SINAD (signal relative to noise+distortion) is dominated by harmonic distortion.  Here, those harmonics are very high order which perceptually is not very good as they are not masked as easily.  Anyway, with a SINAD of 71 dB, we have below average performance:The XLS1502 did a bit better in this regard, garnering a SINAD of 77 dB.Frequency response shows the same sharp cut off:I don't know if this can be changed using DSP programming or not.Above is with resistive load.  Switching to a simulation of a 2-way speaker gets us little difference:So there is some speaker dependency but I would not lose sleep over it.Crosstalk is OK but could be better:The red line is a $30 amplifier by the way.32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" gives a more hopeful picture of distortion:The spray of harmonics is high in frequency where our hearing threshold is higher.Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts but gets better at full power:Lower gain settings may improve this a few dBs.Amplifier Power MeasurementsYou don't buy this amplifier to listen at 5 watts so let's see what it can do when its wings are given enough room to fly:Wow!  Nearly 500 watts of power is delivered into both channels simultaneously.  The good news doesn't end there. Check out these ratings when distortion is relaxed to 1%:1600 watts of peak power is delivered out of standard 120 volt outlet!  These thing is a powerful beast.Noise level is decent but I wanted to make sure the high gain was not impacting it.  So I reduced gain to 19 dB which required some 6 volts of input to drive to clipping:There is no difference at all.For the rest of these tests I stayed at 19 dB gain.  Here is the power output with 8 ohm:Over 300 watts at what should be inaudible distortion for most people.Finally we get to my stress test.  I played with the settings because the high frequency noise shaping would not let me perform the sweep.  So I decided to change this test and set the limit to 22.4 kHz (instead of usual 90 kHz) and limit the sweep to 6 kHz.  That way, the third harmonic of 6 kHz (18 kHz) is still included in the computation.  No music has full power at high frequencies anyway so I don't think we need to keep measuring to 20 kHz with respect to power.  Here is the output:As noted, the red warning lights came on as the sweep was going from right to left so I terminated the test.  Delivered output was about 520 watts which is still plenty but is naturally lower than 1 kHz which was in high 600s.ConclusionsThese pro amps have mastered the technique of delivering tons of power with distortion and noise kept under control.  Lack of power is the #1 reason an amplifier can sound bad.  Don't care how good the SINAD is at 5 watt.  If you run out of power, you will hear distortion, lack of dynamics, etc.  So if you need the power, it is best to get it than to have less of it.  And on that front, the Crown XLS 2502 delivers tons of it, breaking all previous records for any amplifier I have tested.  The price is ridiculously low for the amount of power you get as well.Ideally, you would use more finessed amplifiers above bass frequencies and use the XLS 2502 to drive the subs.  But if not, the XLS2502 can deliver good performance.Overall, I am going to recommend the XLS 2502.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.It is two minutes to midnight.

      " Dayton Audio APA1200DSP DSP analog and digital input stereo class D amplifier. It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me. Parts Express is selling it for US $650 right now.The APA1200DSP has nicer look than typical pro amplifiers:The back is especially nice with the type of connectivity you need in a home system:Both analog and digital inputs are provided.  Ethernet input allows a nicely done web interface to be used from anywhere:There is a microphone I believe and ability to automatically calibrate the room response.  I did not use or dive into this functionality.There is a fan that came on when powered on but nicely powered down gradually and I did not hear it during operation.  When it runs it has a lower frequency and a bit less annoying than on pro amplifiers.There is a strange setting for 2 vs 4 ohm speaker load.  I set it to 4 since I tested it at 4 and 8 ohms.  Manual doesn't say exactly what this does.APA1200DSP Amplifier MeasurementsI set the gain to -10 dB which gave me the nominal 29 dB I look for and measured using XLR input:Switching to digital input showed essentially the same performance:This level of noise+distortion (SINAD) puts this amp way down in our rankings:Noise level was not very good either, using analog or digital input:Unit was stable on power up which is good:Crosstalk was decent:Multitone suffered from high noise floor and sporadic distortion spikes:Sadly frequency response is highly load dependent due to class D amp's output filter interacting:We also see sharp cut off due to internal processing being at low sampling rate.  Switching to digital input at 96 kHz sampling made no difference:The name indicates it produces 1200 watts.  Let's see what it can do into 4 om with both channels driven:The curve wiggles as protection circuit kicks in.  Prior to that, it produced 370 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% didn't do much better:Switching to 8 ohm naturally cut the power substantially:Stepping through the test frequency shows a number of odd behaviors:ConclusionsTypical of this class of amplifier, power specs are mostly imaginary.  Objective measurement of noise and distortion are also typical with little attention paid to minimize them.  So you are left with buying this for functionality not because it has any great implementation of class D amplification.I can't recommend the Dayton Audio APA1200DSP DSP based on its pure measured performance.

      " Vista Audio Spark II stereo integrated  amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $389 from the company direct.The Spark comes in a deep but otherwise small case:Nice to have dual inputs and volume control.   The rear of the amp is a bit unusual in placing the mains input between the connectors:Would have thought to put the IEC jack all the way to the left and speaker to the right.  Doesn't matter if the performance is good anyway.Is this the first audio product we have tested from Serbia?Vista Audio Spark MeasurementsI had to crank the volume all the way up to get close to my nominal 29 dB gain (per THX spec):Boy, that is a lot of power supply noise.  Playing with grounding reduced the spikes at 60 Hz a bit but did nothing to the harmonics which are caused by the internal power supply.  Even if that was low, the distortion spikes are not.  As a result, the amplifier rates quite low in our overall ranking:Signal to noise ratio is better than what we saw in the dashboard indicating the noise floor rises with power:I was surprised to see a bass roll off in this day and age where just about every amplifier is dc-coupled:Multitone shows a messy response with the lows polluted by the power supply and highs due to inadequate feedback:Crosstalk is below average:The amplifier is rated at only 20 watts but I was not able to get that:It did better actually with 8 ohm load indicating current delivery is its issue:Back to 4 ohm, if you allow more distortion or buRst the input, you do get a bit more power:Finally, there is fair bit of variability when we sweep frequencies:ConclusionsSometimes I really wonder what appeal such amplifiers have that attract buyers.  This amp has too little power to drive most speakers and has a lot of noise and distortion as well.  There must be some mystique about it that I don't understand.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Vista Audio Spark II amplifier.  I hope the designer sees these measurements and at least works to sharply reduce the power supply noise as that can't be anything good no matter what school you are from.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Parasound Zamp V.3 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The version I have is a revision or two older than what Parasound builds (I think).  The latest version is being sold on Amazon for US $277 including Prime shipping.  Considering this is a brand name company and we have a class AB amplifier, this seems like a reasonable price.The Zamp V.3 comes in a tiny and rather cute, half-rack package:In addition to power button, you also have a headphone jack.  From the bit I have read, the output is just the amplifier with a resistor inline.  This means its output impedance is high (not good) and likely noisy as well.  I did not test it.The back panel exposes good bit of control not seen on \"normal\" hifi amplifiers:Parasound has a leg in two industries: the Custom Integration (CI) channel and hifi.  The former is for companies who install these amplifiers in hide-away places to for example power a couple of speakers for a bedroom TV.  The gain controls and such give flexibility to this kind of installation as does the small form factor (the amp could be hidden behind a flat panel TV.  Being part of this channel means that when the automation is redone in a home using it, these units are ripped out and put on sale at low prices.  I see this amp advertised for as little as $149 on ebay.I was shocked when I read that this amp was class AB and after I looked inside and saw a heavy and large pancake toroidal transformer.   How the heck did they put in inefficient class AB amp in there with no heatsinking that was visible?  The answer came to me after I let the unit warm up for a little over 5 minutes at 5 watts being output from each channel.  The amp went dead and displayed a thermal overload!  It can't produce just 10 watts for five minutes?  No, it can't. I touched the bottom of the amp and it nearly burned my hand.  A narrow painted strip of metal fastened to the chassis carries the brunt of heat generated.  Being on the bottom and having no fins means that the heat is not spread at all resulting in overheating.  I put a cooling fan on it and it took a good 2 to 3 minutes to come back to life.  And I ran the rest of the tests that way.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWell, this ain't a pretty sight.  One channel is much worse than the other.  No amount of playing with the grounding, or messing with the switch in the back helped with any of the mains/power supply related tones either.  The averaged ranking is below mean of all of the amps tested so far (77 amplifiers to date!):Crosstalk was poor, matching a $25 amplifier I tested:Frequency response is OK:Noise performance as you can predict from the dashboard is not fantastic:Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet's get into the most important bit which is power capability starting with 4 and going into 8 ohms:Weird how one channel goes crazy at just 1 to 2 watt.  Specs are matched though.Allowing for higher distortion of 1% doesn't help with max power but does give us more burst power:Thermal StabilityHere is the test that resulted in the shutdown:I was messing with grounding and caused that little blip so ignore that.ConclusionsI really like the cute and small form factor of this amp for desktop use.  Alas, with a weak thermal management, it won't produce much volume before shutting down.  Used ones have probably had a hard life due to this reason as well.  If you are going to play with one and want to shy away from the million switching amplifiers out there in this price range, go ahead.  But I can't recommend the unit.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Drove back and forth through traffic all day to drop off tested gear and picking up new (nearly 200 miles).

      " Yamaha A-U671 USB DAC and integrated class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The A-U671 costs US 499 but most vendors say it is no longer available even though it shows as current on Yamaha site.  How fast modern gear becomes obsolete...Yamaha has been clever to mimic the look of 1970s and 1980s switchgear:Alas, the controls are plastic and don't have nearly the nice feel of their old brethren.  The volume control is motorized though and is operable through the remote. A built-in DAC and analog input would nicely satisfy many people.  Unfortunately the unit arrived with something rattling in it. I took it part to find out it was a clamp of sort for the power supply bundle that had come loose.  I put it back together and all worked except the USB DAC.  I could control it, change its sample rate and such but it would not produce audio (with stock or Yamaha driver).  Another one of the power supply screws was also loose.  They should have put thread lock on them so that they don't come loose. The back panel is as expected but with decent quality speaker terminals:Since I had to take the unit apart anyway, here is a quick teardown:The DAC is on top and the amp on the bottom of the green board.  The yellow board is the switching power supply.  And that black wrapper is what had come lose.In use the amp was very quick to shut down on overload.  It would actually power off telling me it may be the power supply that is undersized. Temperature rise is not remotely an issue. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load @ 5 watts:I set the volume control manually to 29 dB as I normally do with integrated amps.  SINAD which represents the worst of noise and/or distortion is dominated by distortion.  At 70 dB, this is well below average:Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about either:Crosstalk is good (one channel bleeding into another):Frequency response is problematic, showing that it changes with your speaker load:Multitone shows frequency dependent error and high noise floor:Here are the power ratings:The regulated switching power supply allows no headroom:Thermal StabilityNot a whole lot changed with warm-up:ConclusionsI have a soft spot for the look of the Yamaha A-U671.  And inclusion of a USB DAC in a light and compact enclosure.  Not much else to hang your hat on from there on.  If you can find one at a yard sale for $100 it would be a good purchase.

      " Naim Uniti Atom streamer, DAC and integrated amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $3,799.The overall industry design is attractive and has a high-end look to it.  Alas, every part of the unit has an ultra sharp edge from heatsinks to edges of the plexiglass (?) front panel.  It is a heavy box which makes you really feel those sharp edges as if they are going to tear into your skin.  It was unpleasant every time I had to move or rotate the unit.The front panel is large and sharp which I like.  Alas, and strangely so, it is not a touch screen.  In this day and age and at this price, a touchscreen is a requirement in my opinion.  A very large rotary control managed the volume.  It seem to have some kind of acceleration but wasn't very intuitive.Here is the back panel:I was surprised to see the compact binding posts that are made only for banana plugs.  Likewise there is no USB B to use the unit as a DAC.  Maybe you can use the type-A connector for that but even so, it is very unusual choice.  Nice to see a floating ground switch.  In my testing, it only impacted the networked tests.  Otherwise it had no effect.Inclusion of HDMI is very important to allow sound from TV to be piped into it.Upon booting and with Ethernet cable plugged in, it nicely told me there is new firmware.  It took something like 10 minutes to download the image and then went into a seemingly infinity cycles of booting, dark screen, non-descript progress bar and power button that would fade on or off or solid on.  I left there for probably half hour when it finally seem to be ready.There is the usual app to control it but I opted for the included remote control.  It too has very sharp edges but otherwise functional.Naim Uniti Atom DAC MeasurementsI started by testing the unit using Coax due to lack of type-B or type-c USB port.  Here is our usual dashboard:Distortion dominates causing our SINAD (noise+distortion) to barely reach into \"fair\" category:Distortion rises into the noise floor of even 16 bit content so not a good first showing.  As noted, changing the grounding mode made no difference in any of these measurements.The output stage is capable of higher voltage which is nice:Good to see the output does not become all distorted once the internal amplifier is pushed beyond clipping. Noise performance is not competitive with even budget DACs but almost good enough for 16-bit playback:Multitone distortion was quite high:Jitter display looks clean but noise floor is high and is masking interference patterns:Levels of those spurious tones though is quite low and inaudible (-128 dB).We have a rather odd filter response:This partially contributes to rather poor noise+distortion relative to frequency:Finally, linearity matches the fair performance of the rest of the system:Naim Uniti Atom Amplifier MeasurementGiven the choice of analog or digital input, I tested both which producing 5 watts:Performance is very close so I opted to use analog in as that makes the comparison to other amps easier.  Notice the high power supply noise at 120 Hz (double mains frequency in US).  Overall ranking is well below average:Frequency response test with analog input shows a brick wall filter which indicates input is being digitized:Shame then that no DSP functionality is provided.  The roll off filter in the ADC causes some drooping in the high frequencies.Crosstalk response was kind of shaky but overall good:Multitone test once again shows less than optimal performance:Rated power is low and that is what we see:Sweeping the frequency for power measurement we get orderly response:Notice the typical sharp drop in power at 20 Hz.  This is why you need more powerful amplifier than you think you are getting.  Power is needed in bass but the reservoir capacitors in the power supply get depleted and you don't get as much output.Naim Unit Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI expected the headphone output to be \"junk\" but it actually is not:That is plenty of output for satisfactory response of high impedance headphones.  Noise floor is not competitive with any modern/recommended headphone amp but could have been far worse.  At 32 ohm though, available power is much more limited:Sweeping the load we see that the headphone amplifier is not capable of much current delivery:So best to stay with high impedance headphones.Naim Uniti Atom Streaming MeasurementsI ran the streaming tests a day later and here, I noticed noise bleeding into the output:So I tried the ground lift switch and it remedied that:SINAD though is dominated by high distortion so didn't matter one way or the other.  And performance is the same as local/coax S/PDIF input.ConclusionsPerformance of Naim Atom ranges from fair/adequate to rather poor.  Shame that when you pay so much for a piece of audio, not much design hygiene is included.  I suspect more went into software development and enclosure design than making sure the hardware is performant.  I hope for a version 2 the company works to substantially improve the performance of these subsystems.  I am sure many buy a Naim product thinking they are getting great audio performance.I can't recommend the Naim Uniti Atom streaming amplifier.P.S.  I was going to give the mailman panther rating to the unit but he is out making deliveries......-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " vintage Audio Research D300 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a local member.  The D300 came out circa 1995 and initially cost US $3,500 but then price rose to US $4,000.  Quick search shows used ones going for US $1,500.The D300 is built like a tank:I am confident you could drive over it and nothing will happen to it.  Even the handles are massive which is a blessing as an ultra heavy transformer sits vertically behind the front panel. I could carry the D300 by myself so it is not too heavy to be unmanageable. The back panel is as you expect:With one exception: the non-detachable power cord.   What is there though seems amply sufficient as it is supple yet quite thick.Heatsinks are very thick gauge and in use, they got warm but not hot.  The rest of the case got warm as well.  The amp never complained no matter what I did to it in testing.Overall, if you want an understated but high quality feel, that is what you have in D300.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Ouch.  Lots of second harmonic causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion and noise to be rather poor.  As such the D300 lands well below average in our list of some 62 amplifiers tested to date:Noise performance was quite good though so it is the distortion that is the problem:32-tone test signal representing \"music\" showed what we already know as far as rather high distortion levels:Frequency response was excellent:As was crosstalk (one channel bleeding into the other):Let's get into the meat of the measurements with power vs THD+N starting at 4 ohm:Boy, this is worse than the dashboard indicated.  Almost immediately, distortion takes over and keeps climbing.  While the D300 is much more quiet, it quickly loses to an integrated home theater receiver (NAD T758)!  Not good.Same story repeats for 8 ohm load:Distortion is so high at higher power levels that if we set a limit of 0.1% for THD+N, we only get 60 watts out of each channel!Relaxing that to 0.2% though gave us a lot more power and no indication of frequency mattering.  This was proven yet again in our multiple sweeps:All the lines fall on top of each other indicating the amp just doesn't care what frequency you feed it.  It amplifies it, adds a heap of distortion and that is that. Makes you want to cry and celebrate at the same time!ConclusionsThere is clear excellence in the engineering in Audio Research D300.  Build quality is superb as well.  There must have been a conscious decision to use low amount of feedback which translated into rising distortion with power.  It is a shame that capable designers follow audiophile myths to build non-performant amplifiers when they could do so much better.In this day and age, this type of performance is not competitive so I really can't recommend the D300.  Then again if you want something with high build quality and can get the unit on the cheap, it makes for a decent option.--------As always, questions, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.Ever walk through a high-end department store and get hounded by the ladies selling perfume?

      " Topping PA3 desktop amplifier.  I have had a ton of requests to measure this amplifier so I asked the company to send me one.  They said they would do so but cautioned me that it would not measure well.  The PA3 costs US $120 on Amazon including free shipping.I must stay, compared to all the budget amplifiers I have tested, the PA3 looks like luxury goods!  It comes in a hefty case and oozes quality:There are dual inputs as you see which you can control using the power button.  A massive, Topping branded external power supply is provided which even goes as far as having textured design on the back side:Most importantly, all the regulatory certifications are there which we know from past examination to be true and certified by third-party labs.  This is one budget amplifier I wouldn't hesitate to leave on unattended.Implementation is based on TDA7498E ST Micro chip amp.  Topping PA3 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm using 1 kHz tone:As you see I adjusted the volume control to give us the nominal 29 dB gain I usually test at.  SINAD is dominated by distortion which at 0.036% which correlates well with ST Micro's 0.05% spec at 1 watt.  Alas, this is well below average for all amplifiers we have tested and some of the latest chip amp products:SNR slots in the same bucket of performance:Crosstalk is pretty good showing good attention to isolation:Frequency response unfortunately is very load dependent:We get about 51 watts into 4 ohm with both channels driven with distortion dominating (hence the reason the graph doesn't slope down):Power naturally drops with 8 ohm load but not as much some others I have seen:Peak power matches company spec which is a novelty in this space:Note that there was a really strong protection circuit that would not allow me to push the amp more than I did for max power so I had to settle for lower distortion of 0.5%.  It would shut down if I told it to work harder to hit 1%.Distortion takes off rather quickly with frequency as we see in multitone test:Same is see in our frequency versus power and distortion+noise:Fortunately our hearing threshold starts to go up at higher frequencies so audibility is less impacted than our sensibility about good engineering.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping did what it could to build a reliable, safe and robust desktop platform for this amplifier.  Alas, they are held down significantly by the performance of the underlying chip amp which is likely all that was available at the time this product was designed.  Being selfish elitist audiophile engineering types that we are, we have no choice but to pass on this amplifier.  If you are not picky however and want something that is build safe and well, you could choose otherwise.So to repeat, I can't recommend the Topping PA3 based on its audio performance.  Hopefully there are future products based on a better platform.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 integrated amplifier with tube buffer.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,599.The front panel of the Sphinx portrays a high-end look with its thick metal:Alas, that thin metal surrounding it, takes that impression away.  I liked the very wide apart inputs and output terminals which \"should\" bode well for crosstalk measurements:There is good bit of weight to the unit courtesy of power transformer.  I like the inclusion of the balance control.  As you see in the first picture, I had to use it to get same gain out of both channels.  Protection circuit was well done with automatic recovery and worked great no matter how hard I pushed it.Internal amplification is provided by a pair of Hypex UCD 180 OEM class D amplifiers.  A buffer state made out of tubes completes the picture.The amplifier has won many accolades as indicated by their mention on the product page:Let's see if objectively they are right.Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 MeasurementsAs usual, I set the gain to 29 dB and feed the amp a 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm at 5 watts and see what we get:What we get is not very nice.  Broad set of harmonics to the tune of -80 dB do away with any notion of \"tube sound.\"  Add fair bit of noise and SINAD which is a measure of distortion+noise sinks quite low:That's 10 dB worse than the media across 140 amplifiers tested so far.  Not good.  As a reference, Hypex specifications shows a SINAD of 84 dB so 15 dB was lost in the addition of the buffer stage in this amplifier.Another thing that is not good is signal to noise ratio:So even at full power your 2 bits short of CD's dynamic range. The shocker was the normally \"innocent\" crosstalk test which just about every amplifier does well in:Then comes Sphinx, losing to our $20 throw-away amplifier!  Clearly zero attention was paid to isolation of the two channels.Frequency response also shows sloppy attention to producing the audible band properly:Let's measure our power vs distortion:Definitely much less happy driving 4 ohm load.  Here is our peak and max power:So moderately powerful although without much headroom.ConclusionsRogue Audio takes a perfectly serviceable Hypex UcD 180 amplifiers and adds copious amount of noise and distortion with its front-end.  Mind you, despite use of the tube, it doesn't give that 2nd harmonic dominant result.  It just raises the noise and distortion, robbing you of transparency.  But hey, folks buy audio products by how many myths are included in their design and Rogue audio gets there with that tube stage.  Perfect marketing, poor engineering.  Story of high-end audio.Needless to say, I can NOT recommend the Rogue Audio Sphinx V3.  You can get plenty of better amplifiers for this level of money.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Behringer NX3000D Pro DSP power amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me by a member.  It costs US $399.As pro amplifiers go, the NX3000D is half attractive especially when on with its amber lights and LEDs:There are variable (analog) gains as you see.  I did not play with the DSP or menu system but it lets you do such useful things as setting up a crossover to drive a sub.  There is built-in power limiting in there.The unit is quite light.  So light that you think it may fly away given its large and noisy fan:The fan unfortunately is not temperature sensitive and wails away upon power up!  I am sure saving weight is a big deal when you try to squeeze every dollar out of shipping costs.  Good news is that as they advertise, this thing runs as cool as it can get.  After a bunch of testing, the temperature was the same as the room.Note that speaker connections are SpeakOn which I like but not common in consumer audio.  Inputs are only balanced XLR/1/4 combo.  There is extra gain though to use RCA unbalanced with them using an adapter.  Where I placed the gain knobs provided 29 dB of gain.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amp 1 kHz and see what else it outputs beside that at 5 watts into 4 ohm test load:What it outputs is a bunch of distortion in the form of third harmonic at 3 kHz placing the unit well below average:Note also the disparity in channel output which you can also see in the frequency response measurement:The gain controls are notched so not easy to select any in-between gains to adjust for this.Another news is how narrow the bandwidth is.  Being a DSP amplifier, it digitizes the input and it seems to use 48 kHz sampling resulting in bandwidth of 24 kHz.Noise performance is not that great at 5 watts, falling well below 96 dB we like to see for CD/streaming 16-bit content:Fortunately at full power (right), you do clear that hurdle.These amps are sold almost exclusively by how much power they produce versus their cost so let's get into that with 4 ohm load:Seems like the rated power numbers are a fantasy unless they are measured for one channel driven, not two as I do.  Still, 400 watts is lots of power in such a cheap package.  You get a  bit more as well if you allow the distortion to rise to 1% and also measure it as a peak (right):Switching the load to 8 ohms naturally lowers available power:Switching/class-D amps can have complex distortion profiles that highly depend on frequency and power level and we see some of that here:At higher frequencies different distortion mechanisms become dominant causing the curves to go up and down. While I always see some power loss at 20 Hz, it is disappointing to see it dip so low to just 268 watts for an amplifier rated at \"900 watts.\"  Bass is where we need the power.Finally, we can remove our filter and examine the ultrasonic spectrum to see what the amp is producing there:Switching frequency seems to be around 410 kHz which is well above the audible band, and is attenuated quite a lot for a switching amplifier (-26 dB).  I am not too happy to see so much other junk there though although not audible per se.ConclusionsPro amps can often make good alternative to hi-fi amps since they are sold at much lower cost/watt than consumer products.  We get that in Behringer NX3000D but we also get the other drawbacks of pro products in the form of high fan noise.  And distortion that is pretty high.  If you can hide it some place and use it to do drive a subwoofer it should be fine.  But otherwise, I think a more quiet amplifier would work better for home hifif than this unit.Overall, the Behringer NX3000D is not my cup of tea for home use so I can't recommend it.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Just ate a bowl of carrots from our garden that I planted months ago.  Tasted great.  Alas, it is time to plant more already for fall harvest and I need money for seeds.  So please donate what you can using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Luxman SQ-N150 hybrid integrated amplifier with phono stage. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $3,295.Can you say pretty? I knew you could!  Love the elegant front panel with VU meter. Nice set of balance and tone controls are provided as well:As you can see, power amplification is provided through ECC83 triode drivers going to EL84 power tubes. Amplifier is conservatively designed and is rate at just 10+10 watts into 6 ohms. I like the look without the cage but here it is with:Not much exciting in the back other than modern, beefy speaker terminals than that of vintage tube amplifiers:The package is smaller than one imagines but weighs a hefty 27 pounds.  Notice the AC terminal doesn't have earth ground and unit is double insulated. In testing I found no effect from earthing the unit or not.Front-end and pre-amps are solid state:Luxman SQ-N150 Amplifier MeasurementsWhen I picked 5 watts as my standard for measuring amplifiers, it was usually a fraction of the amplifier power but here it is nearly half the available power!  So relatively speaker, distortion plays a much strong role than it would otherwise:The high second and third harmonics set the stage as far as SINAD (due to push-pull design) but I wish there was not so much power supply noise.  Sadly the amplifier takes up the ranking of second worst amplifier I have ever measured as far as distortion+noise:Those power supply spikes set the lower bound for dynamic range:It is not too bad but you likely will use very sensitive speakers with this low power amplifier so the numbers may manifest themselves more than they usually do.Frequency response is extended but shows a kink indicating some kind of filter:Crosstalk does not follow the usual curve indicating some sort of resistive (?) element between the two channels:Normally the issue is capacitive which causes the two reference lines you see.Multitone which is supposed to resemble \"music\" with its 32 tone, shows strong level of \"grass\" (intermodulation distortion):Hard to make a case that you are hearing more detail when so much is masked at this power level.I don't have a 6 ohm load so used my usual 4 and 8 ohm loads for power testing:Edit: forgot to post the different frequency sweeps:Luxman SQ-N150 Phono Stage MeasurementsThe amplifier noise and distortion dwarfs the phono stage so I only checked its frequency response:So very good on this critical measurement.Luxman SQ-N150 Headphone MeasurementsFor same reason as above, I just made a power measurement:Seems usable from power availability point of view but noise and distortion are quite high.  Company specifies 16 ohm output impedance and wisely recommends against using low impedance headphones for good reason:The headphone amplifier is simply connected to the amplifier output using the aforementioned resistor which eats up all the power.  It will also change the frequency response of your headphone if it is not flat.  So best to be avoided.Luxman SQ-N150 Listening TestsMy lab speaker is an infinity R253 which has a sensitivity of 87 dB.  I connected it to the SQ-N150 and started to listen.  I had to immediately acknowledge the lack of power as the volume control not only maxed out but there was so much distortion as to cause crackling noise.  I backed off to moderate listening level and the sound was OK but I noticed boominess in the lows as if you have more room modes than you do.  To confirm, I switched to Topping PA5 amplifier on my bench and boominess was gone.  Likely the harmonic distortion of the amplifier is hitting on more room modes causing extra bass/boominess.  I can see if your speakers/setup lacks bass that you experience a bit more of it.The volume control had to be kept below 12:00 o'clock.  By 1:00 o'clock distortion would start to set in and sound would start to get grungy and rough.  Past 2:00 o'clock it would be rather obvious and beyond that, unusable.  There was usable volume with me sitting 5 feet from the single speaker.  With two speakers you could double that but it is still not enough power for me with this speaker.  If an audio reviewer can't hear this level of distortion, they should give up testing audio gear.  Sadly none of the reviews I read made a remark about the distortion.  It is the classic case of paying a lot more and getting a lot less fidelity and enjoyment.ConclusionsThe high level picture here is very clear: wonderful looking, and presumably well built amplifier.  The problem is using tube technology and producing so little power. I see no advantage to it, euphonically or otherwise.  But it is possible for some people the bass impact is a positive.  But at what cost?  So much spent with so little dynamic capability due to lack of power.Needless to say I can't recommend the Luxman SQ-N150. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Sabaj A1 desktop (small) amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  Not sure if it is still in production but you can still find it for $60 or so.  Main interest in testing this unit is the use of the TPA3118 class D amplifier which is used in all kinds of other devices including Genelec 8030c powered monitor!For the price the enclosure is not half bad:A little LED display shows the active input (there are two) and current volume level.  As is typical, a laptop sized power supply provides the juice:The unit runs cool.  If you overtax it, it will reset and power back on at low output level.Sabaj A1 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt dashboard:As you see I set the gain to 29 dB which is the \"standard\" I use for integrated amplifiers.  Resulting SINAD is dominated by distortion and is well below average for all amps tested:But... if you compare it to other low cost amps in this price bracket, performance is a good 10 dB better.Noise performance is in the same class:Frequency response is not flat but good to see it rolling off as opposed to peaking:Crosstalk is what you expect in this type of device:Most important is power and this is how the A1 did into 4 ohm:Not a whole lot of power I am afraid.  Pushing it harder didn't do any good either:The power supply runs out of juice and the device shuts down.  May do better with a more powerful power supply.  Here it is into 8 ohm:ConclusionsAs a class I expect these cheap amps to be broken.  The A1 is not that bad.  My concern is too little power.  Many small speakers are inefficient and you need more than 20 watts to get decent performance out of them.  My suggestion is to save on spending money on food and flowers and save up for a better amp.  But if you can't, the Sabaj A1 may do the job for you.As it is, I can't recommend the Sabaj A1.  I am too much of an audio/technology snob to go for it!------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Appreciate any donations using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Pyle PT8000CH 8-channel or 8-zone distribution power amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped by a member and costs US $269. Member purchased it for just $158 on sale!You probably can't tell from the picture but this is a massive box.  It weighs over 50 pounds/23 kilograms and is quite deep.  Rack mounts are provided and needed for both front and back. A review says the back holes don't align right however.  Back panel shows why this amplifier is also tailored for multi-room distribution:\\By selecting \"bus mode,\" a single input is distributed to any number of channels from 1 to 8.  In mono or stereo.  Trim pots are provided to adjust the gain for each channel although there were kind of too sensitive to set accurately.The side panels gave me paus until I powered the unit:I feared that those fans would make huge amount of noise but to my pleasant surprise, they barely move and are essentially silent.  They never sped up or got louder during testing.  This is far better solution than my pro amps I test with loud and small fans that are not even temperature sensitive.Back to the front, the power switch is quite bright (blue) and bleeds into the LED bar graphs.  But once the unit is on, the LED bar graphs themselves light up and more or less cover that issue.  The power switch feels quite solid.Pyle as a brand is know for cheap (read junk) so my expectations were not high going into the review.  The overall construction though, with dual toroidal transformers in front, portrayed a different picture.  Let's see how it measures.Pyle PT8000CH MeasurementsI stayed with stereo measurements for this section selecting the channels 7 and 8 that are next to the AC power input.  Warm up allowed the amp to improve a bit:Here is our dashboard:We have a spray of harmonic distortion that sinks SINAD fairly low:Zooming in:We see that the company that it keeps is not too bad!  SNR falls inline or perhaps a bit better:Multitone is as we would expect from the dashboard:Frequency response is good although I wished for a bit more bandwidth as to get a flatter response to 20 kHz:Crosstalk though was surprisingly poor:Let's see how much power we have into 2 channels:Benefit of large power supply comes in when just driving in stereo:Here is 8 ohm performance (company spec = 100 watts):Finally, here is power vs frequency:Here is on/off noise:I hooked up the amplifier to an infinity R253 speaker and I could hear a faint pop on power up.  Power off seemed silent although the fan noise may have masked that.Multichannel Amplifier TestingMy analyzer is only stereo but I drove all channels with the same 8 ohm load.  Here is the output power in stereo and 8 channels:We are meeting spec here which is good (there is some nonsense about 8000 watts peak which we forgive and ignore).All the testing so far has been resistive.  Let's make the load \"reactive\" by 30 and 60 degrees angle and also sweep down to 2 ohm and see what happens:This is quite robust!  At both 4 and 8 ohms, the amp doesn't care if the load is reactive or not.  At 2 ohm though, it starts to complain, dropping its output voltage by nearly half.  Testing at 1 ohm resulted in momentary shutdown.ConclusionsThe build quality of this 8-channel amplifier seems quite substantial.  Massive power supply courtesy of dual toroidal transformers powers the 8 channels well, allowing the amplifier to meet spec.  Distortion and noise are rather high though and rank well below our average.  The amplifier protection and ability to handle complex loads is excellent. You are paying almost nothing for this amplifier (the case alone could cost you this much!) yet you get way above a broken design.  The PT8000CH won't be my main choice for a high-performance 2-channel system but for surround duty and certainly multi-room amplification, it seems fine.I am going to recommend the Pyle PT8000CH.  Not because it has great measured performance as far as noise and distortion.  But that it delivers way, way above its cost point.Edit: teardown is now posted: always,\n",
      " Topping MX3 DAC, Bluetooth, Headphone Amplifier, and Power amplifier.  You even get a remote control with it. Despite all that functionality it costs just USD $130 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  I bought mine from Massdrop 10 months ago.  I don't know what I paid but likely less.From the outside, the MX3 looks quite attractive:It has the same design language as the Topping DX3 Pro but even more attractive with that slanted logo.  The volume control is digital and very sensitive.  There is a ton of functionality here which I won't go into as there is a good review of it from Z which I will post after this review.  Suffice it to say, it is very feature rich and well designed for such a bargain product.Everything is powered by an external laptop sized switching power supply:Not only is extra expense incurred in getting a Topping branded power supply, but typical of them it comes with full compliance with regulatory bodies both in US and EU.For most of my testing, I used the USB input but did give the Aux analog input a try as well.  I did not test the subwoofer out.  Not did I play with Bluetooth.If the MX3 performs, it will be the audio miracle of modern times so let's get into measurements.  But first a note: I had to take some shortcuts to get through all of this functionality.  I think it represents the missing measurements.DAC MeasurementsThere are no line outs on the MX3 so I used the headphone output set to 2 volts to get our dashboard view:Oh no! Distortion is fairly high putting the MX3 in bottom class of all DACs tested:This is quite a bit worse than any DAC Topping has produced and will set the limit for the rest of the measurements.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our all important power versus distortion+noise at 300 ohm:The higher noise and distortion in the dashboard comes into play here putting the MX3 fair bit behind its look-alike, Topping DX3 Pro.  At 33 milliwatt power before clipping, there is not sufficient amount for a desktop amplifier.  Then again if you listen to the DX3 Pro in low gain, there is more power here than there.Using 33 ohm load we examine the current delivery of the headphone amplifier:Similar story here except 230 milliwatts is good amount of power for low impedance headphones.I was pleasantly surprised to see a very low output impedance in MX3:This means you can use any headphone with the MX3 and not have its frequency response change because of output impedance.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsOur dashboard for power amplifier calls for 5 watts of output:The amplifier is quite a bit worse than the DAC, showing a disappointing SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) of just 68 dB.  This is not performance you want to brag about to your friends:Here is the full power curve into 4 ohm load:Usually amplifiers keep reducing their THD+N as the signal gets stronger relative to noise.  Not so here.  Distortion is high enough that at just 1 watt, it starts to dominate and flattens the curve until clipping at about 30 watts.  More power can be had if you get it spike up a bit as shown so the unit meets its spec of I think 40 watts into 4 ohm.Here is the THD+N versus power versus frequency:The issue here is rising distortion in high frequencies regardless of amount of power being output.  1 kHz test tone we use in the dashboard then is almost the best case scenario.  By the way, the above test was performed with Aux input so that I could vary the input voltage as I do with other power amplifiers.Here is out signal to noise ratio:So not quite as good as CD's dynamic range.Listening TestsI only tested the headphone amplifier this way.  I will at some point start testing with speakers.With Sennheiser HD-650 high impedance headphone, there was good bit of power giving a physical sensation of bass.  Alas, by then distortion would set it and the sound would get bright and corrupted.Things changed with much lower impedance Hifiman HE-400i.  There was plenty of volume here and I had to try really hard to get it to distort.  It would do so but at levels I did not want to listen to for more than a second or two.  Bass sensation was quite good bringing the full dynamic range out of these headphones which lesser powered headphone amplifiers cannot.ConclusionsThe only bright spot in the Topping MX3 performance is its headphone amplifier especially with low impedance headphones.  Outside of that, the MX3 disappoints.  While nothing is broken and design clearly verified (Audio Precision graphs are included in the manual), the bar was set quite low to meet the price point. Is the MX3 transparent enough?  Probably for most people.  Is it transparent enough for me to recommend it?  No.  You are much better off with discrete components.  You will be paying more though to get that performance.Am I being too critical?  We had fish chips yesterday at our favorite waterfront restaurant and it cost $57 for the three of us.  Two of those meals and you can have the Topping MX3.  So the value is incredible.  Let me know what you think. ------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.The guy from Nigeria who was selling me the money tree sent me email saying due to my mention of his services last weekend, he is inundated with calls so he has raised his price for shipping and handling ot $3,00.

      " Behringer A500 \"Reference\" Power amplifier.  I purchased this unit on suggestions from members from Amazon for just $199 including Prime shipping.Being targeted at the pro market, this is rack-mount unit with heft heatsinks on each side:Full compliment of inputs are provided from RCA to balanced XLR and TRS.  No input selector is provided though and the manual warns against simultaneous connection to more than one input.The plastic volume knobs feel cheap but otherwise, it seems to be a sturdy build.The manual says it has a class AB output stage.  I am assuming some kind of power rail voltage switching is used to keep power consumption generally low but I have not confirmed this.For my testing, I used a 4 ohm dummy load and balanced XLR inputs.  Let's get into measurements and see how she did.EDIT: the first revision of this review had tested the A500 with the input switch set to bridged.  It has now been updated in proper stereo mode.MeasurementsLet's start with our dashboard:Even though I was using balanced input and outputs from the amplifier, we see large contributions from noise from the power supply in the form of 120 Hz and multiple harmonics.  The harmonic distortion is quite high too with distortion spikes seemingly going on forever.  So even if the power supply was 100% quiet, it would likely still not get better distortion/sinad rating.  A dismal showing regardless, underperforming good DACs by whopping 40 db!Signal to noise ratio is rated at 100 and I get numbers reasonably close to it:Here is distortion versus power:Sad to see a class AB amp not be able to outdo the switching amp in the Topping TP60 with respect to distortion and noise where the two overlap.Thankfully the Behringer A500 has copious amount of power, producing nearly 170 watts prior to clipping.  Behringer's rating is 180 watts at 1% distortion which seems like an honest rating.Frequency response is OK but not as flat as it should be for a power amp in the audible range:If there is rail supply switching, then it likely has an output filter to get rid of switching noise from that and as a result, start to roll off the response as we see above.I think we have a good picture of A500 performance so let's not torture ourselves anymore.  ConclusionsWe seem to have a stream of bad luck with bargain amplifiers.  Sure, they provide exceptional value in how little they charge per watt.  I know I can't make and ship the empty case of this amplifier for $199.  But still, we want good distortion specs that rise up at least to some of the worst DACs we have ever tested.  Heck, these numbers are no better than some analog formats!Given the high distortion levels and somewhat uneven frequency response, I can't recommend the Behringer 500.  If you just want loud amplification, then you do have a bargain here.-----As always, any questions, concerns, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating using Patreon (or\n",
      " AmazonBasics Class D 80 Watt/channel power amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  On Amazon, it cost US $128 but the owner found it on \"Woot\" for just $70.  They are sold out there though.Not a half-bad enclosure especially for the price:It was so confusing to see dual languages on the front panel and the back:I left the bass and treble controls as you see them there.  For testing, I adjusted the gain to 29 dB which is my standard for testing.Amazon Basics 80W MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amplifier a 1 kHz tone with enough amplitude to produce 5 watts and see what we get:Well, this is not good.  Distortion (third harmonic) is quite high at around 68 dB causing the SINAD to be pretty close to the bottom of all the amps we have tested:Frequency response showed high sensitivity relative to (speaker) load:Crosstalk was horrible:How the heck they screwed this up?  The dashed line in teal is a $25 amplifier.32-tone test shows what we saw in the dashboard more or less:We can't clear 16 bit content even at max power:Power curve shows early onset of distortion:At least spec is met (at 4 ohm):Sweeping with different frequencies we see distortion rises a lot with frequency:ConclusionsI am a sucker for a bargain as much as the next person.  But there comes a line that I hate to cross and this amplifier forces me to do so.  There are just so many faults here.  If you want to use it in a garage or workshop, it will be fine and run cooler than little desktop amps.  That is the only positive thing I can say about it.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Amazon Basics 80 Watt amplifier.Edit: see teardown here: always,\n",
      " OSD Nero Stream-XD analog and digital streaming (wifi and Bluetooth) amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member for testing.  It costs US $230 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  There is a bit of heft to this box considering its budget category:There is a rotary control for volume and input selection.  Naturally with no display, you don't know the volume level.  Various inputs are provided although USB is for storage device, not as a DAC:I focused my testing on analog and Toslink inputs.Like the inclusion of power supply in the unit which likely is the reason for some of its weight.  In use, it got warm to touch but nothing concerning.OSD Nero Stream-XD MeasurementsLet's start with using the analog input and see how it does:Well, this is not good.  There is strange/high noise floor plus plenty of distortion.  Perhaps it digitizes the analog input?  Let's test Toslink then:Same bad results.    It ranks way at the bottom of our rankings:Can the news get worse?  Yes, it can:There is a subwoofer output so maybe this is someone's idea of high pass filter!  I looked in the manual and there are no tone controls that could be responsible for this.Let me just post the rest of the graphs and not waste words on a failing design:ConclusionsThis is a prime example of what we in the industry call \"phoned in design.\"  You call up a shop in China, given them your wish list and out comes an amp.  You do no testing yourself and put no requirements as far as performance on the shop that is \"designing\" it.  Result is all the checklist items marketing wants with performance not even on the back of the priority list.  Does it sound better than a sound bar when paired with a couple of speakers?  Should that frequency response not screw things up too bad, maybe.  For me?  I pass and get an AVR instead.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.

      " Nubert nuConnect ampX digital integrated amplifier and wireless connector.  It was purchased by a member from the company in Germany and drop shipped to me.  The ampX costs €689 (US $766).The outside imparts confidence as far as weight and industrial design:Beauty is skin deep though.  The menu structure is very strange.  For example you hit the \"return\" button to get into options and then rotate the number to select.  Hitting return gets you back one step but never back to home menu above.  You have to select \"Volume\" and click on that to get back home.  I had the volume too high once as soon as I changed inputs and could not turn it down immediately.When you turn the unit off with the standby button on the left, a dim display remains saying ampX.  I hope that is not an OLED display or that would be burnt in after a short while.  Why do I need to see that text on the display?  The standby button already turns orange.The rear panel shows the plethora of option to feed the ampX:You have phono state, Bluetooth, and Wifi besides allt he other inputs.  What's more using their app and the microphone in the phone you are supposed to be able to correct for room modes under 160 Hz (I did not test this).Audio MeasurementsI started with our usual dashboard with USB input to ampX and speaker out at 5 watts:Boy, this is not good.  We have high noise floor plus ton sand tons of harmonics and we are at just 5 watts.  I thought may be analog input would be different so tested that:It is a different sort of bad but overall in the same bucket of \"well below average:\"Signal to noise ratio is verypoor:Never seen an amplifier that doesn't improve its signal to noise ratio when you turn it up.  The noise must be getting amplified proportionally with volume.32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows the same problems:Look at those spikes in mid frequencies rising to almost -50 dB.  This is where our hearing is starting to get most sensitive.Frequency response was terrible with digital or analog inputs:There is a high pass filter which I could not figure how to defeat so let it be at 10 Hz.  It must cause that terrible peaking at low frequencies.  Conversely, there is a sharp filter at 20 kHz which roll off starting even earlier.  We are down 3 dB by the time we get to 20 kHz.  And this is with digital input and sample rate of 96 kHz!Let's test the power amp to full power starting at 4 ohm:That is a lot worse than a typical AVR.  Same is true with 8 ohm load:Thermal AnalysisPerformance improved a bit over half of running at 5 watts:ConclusionsI tell you: if manufacturers post measurements, I am sure they would have caught these issues themselves.  Even a marketing person would know the above frequency response would not sell a single unit.  But no.  Customers don't ask for it so manufactures just throw a few numbers over the fence.  Those numbers did point to problems:We actually did better at 0.05%!  How they got this SNR, I don't know :ConclusionsI get the appeal of \"do it all\" amplifier with modern streaming features.  But come on.  Let's get the basics right.  The amp needs to be low noise and distortion and have flat response.  And spend some time make the unit easier to navigate.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Nubert nuConnect ampX.  It had high promise but did not remotely get there.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Christmas season is here and I want to give myself a big present.

      " Fosi Audio BT10A Bluetooth Class D stereo amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The B10A seems to have just been updated with tone controls and sells for US $50 from Amazon with free prime shipping.This is a very small amplifier:You can't see the depth but it is quite shallow.  Other amps like this I have tested have complicated interface to change built-in digital tone controls.  There are none here so it was easy to use.The back connectors is identical to what you see on myriad of such amps:While the external laptop replacement power supply is large compared to the size of the unit, it is not as huge as some others.  Note that it comes with a three-prong, figure-8 AC socket so you have less options to replace the cord.I did not bother testing the Bluetooth.  I am assuming it autoselects it if in range as the priority input as there is no switch to select it.Speaker terminals are tiny of course but I managed to plug in my heavy and large banana jacks into it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain (THX recommendation):Second harmonic dominates to the tune of -65 dB which sets the SINAD to the same value.  This says that noise is not a contributor to SINAD and as such, any gain setting would have produced similar SINAD.  The 65 dB SINAD value doesn't put a smile on anyone's face but it is a couple of steps above $30 units (e.g. Lepy LP-2020A):Noise figures are barely adequate:32-tone test signal shows more or less uniform distortion at all frequencies:19+20 kHz tones shows 55 dB of distortion-free range:Their full (and unrealistic) amplitude shows higher distortions than multitone test does.Frequency response shows truncated low and high frequencies:Above with a resistor load.  Subjective the amp to my new complex speaker model of a 2-way speaker generates:The speaker model has a its impedance shooting up in high frequencies causing similar issue here.  There is a question of whether the model is similar to mass of 2-way speakers so don't run with this yet.  What you can conclude is that the speaker choice does impact the speaker response.  In audible band though, the impact is minimal and in some way is correcting the dip toward 20 kHz.  A good amp would have no speaker load dependency.Let's see how much power the BT10A can produce into 4 ohm load:At 33 watts with both channels driven this is good bit of power.  Similar story with 8 ohm load:Lack of power is by far the #1 issue in these amplifiers.  You may not be able to hear their noise and distortions but you absolutely will hear them complain when they clip.  At these power levels you should have a reasonable experience unlike some other budget amps that stop at 10 watts or so.Allowing for more distortion (1% THD+N) and testing with a short-term sinewave and long term produces identical numbers:The input power supply is regulated so there is no reservoir to provide short-term juice. Thermal StabilityPerformance gradually improved by a 2 dB or so after 30 minutes of playing at 5 watts:Above tests were performed after this warm-up period.ConclusionsThe Fosi Audio BT10A doesn't seem half bad.  I am not going to provide a verdict one way or the other.  You can decide for yourself if the performance is good enough for your application.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.You know the money situation is bad when I have to get a $50 amp on load to test!

      " Audio Research Corporation (ARC) 100.2 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 100.2 came out in year 1998 at a cost of US $2,995.  It was later raised to US $3,495.  If I remember correctly, the owner told me this the last solid state amplifier ARC produces before going to all tube route.The 100.2 is as solid as a rock:The back panel is as you expect with the exception of (custom?) speaker binding posts:In use the 100.2 cooked and cooked good.  I measured 45 to 47 degrees C on the heatsinks.  The internal temps are likely much higher.  I read that it uses unobtanium output MOSFET transistors so if they go, you likely have a giant door stop.    In use though the 100.2 did not complain one bit and ran through all of my tests.Strangely when you power the unit down, it takes it a while to do that.  What it is doing, I don't know.The design of the unit is based on low feedback factor of just 6 dB.  Based on that alone I can tell you it is not going to perform well.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWe have huge power supply peaks, like due to poor power supply rejection ratio of low feedback design.  Second and third harmonic dominate the distortion profile resulting in lackluster SINAD of just 65 dB.  That lands the ARC 100.2 near the bottom of some 72 amplifiers tested so far:Frequency response is excellent:Response changes some with a simulated 2-way speaker load but nothing to cry over:Multitone test shows the high distortion products of the power supply:And rather high noise floor which we can directly measure using signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk shape is odd but not an audible concern:Amplifier Power MeasurementsThe sins of low feedback factor stare at you in the face with our 4 ohm load:Yes, distortion gradually increases but then it clips anyway.  So why not have clean power until clipping???Same deal into 8 ohms:At least it slightly exceeds its power specifications.Strangely burst power (momentary peaks) doesn't generate much more power:Keeping THD+N constant at 0.1% gives us incredibly low and strange amount of power:There is so much distortion and noise in the output of this amp that you don't get much power if you set your goal at 0.1% THD (likely threshold of audibility for some people).  FYI I ran the above at 0.2% THD+N (not shown) and it produced about 80 watts with a straight line.  Anyway, who says only class D amps have trouble with this test?Amplifier Thermal stabilityI powered the unit cold and let it run nearly half hour while recording distortion and noise. This is what I got:That is very high degree of improvement.  Again, low feedback means that it is more sensitive to operating temperature.  Given the high heat dissipation, it is a tough deal to have to also keep the unit on for a while to get the best performance.ConclusionsSigh.  The best analogy I can think of here is if car owners said, \"you know, a car should have more square tires\" and manufacturers running to build cars that way.  Yes, audio folklore says feedback is a bad thing.  Well, I have news for you: distortion is really, really bad thing.  As is noise.  It surely doesn't give you \"blacker background\" if it has higher noise, does it?I read some place that it has less feedback so it can deliver less phase shift.  Do folks not know that you have reflections in your room, every one of which arrives at your ears with a different delay and hence phase?  That they all mix up and as a result, the brain discards that info?  If it did not, we would go crazy trying to make sense of people talking to us in indoor situations.  Anyway, we digress.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the ARC 100.2.  Serviceability will be poor and so will the performance.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Been working on a project morning to evening every day and spending the last two hours before midnight on reviews.

      " Emotiva XPA-DR2 \"differential\" power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1699 from the company direct.This thing a beast both in size and weight:This, despite usage of switchmode power supply to keep the \"weight down.\"  Yeh right.    My back is still complaining....There is no benefit to having a differential power amplifier but seems like they a pair of amps are used out of phase to double the power per channel:The switchmode power supply changes supply rail on (power demand) to keep power consumption low at lower power levels (\"class H\").  In my testing, the DR2 barely got warm so the mechanism is working.Emotiva XPA-DR2 MeasurementsI was expecting good measurements but instead got this:Wow, look at the harmonic spray starting at third one.  SINAD of 64 dB ranks almost at the bottom of nearly 150 amplifiers tested:Not good.Fortunately signal to noise ratio is excellent so this is a quiet amplifier:Frequency response and crosstalk are fine:Multitone test though shows the high distortion across the frequency band:The main meal here is power into 4 and 8 ohm loads versus distortion+noise:That's incredible amount of power.  Alas it is delivered with lots of distortion.  Back to the power, check out the max and peak power:And this is on a shared 20 amp 120 volt outlet.  I don't think we have measured any other amplifier that comes close to this level of output.Similar story holds (good and bad) for 8 ohm:As you see the curve looks nothing like other amplifiers where they are first noise limited until clipping sets in.  Here, distortion is front and center even at 50 milliwatts!We get a look at the architecture of this amplifier by sweeping power at different frequencies:We have a constant glitch around 20 to 50 watts which I am assuming is the amplifier switching rails to higher voltage.  We also have rising distortion as seen in the previous graphs even at low power.ConclusionsAssuming I don't have to carry it much, I love the build and great value as far as $/watt and maximum amount of power available.  SNR is also good so you should be free of speaker hiss.  Distortion is high though and there is no getting around it.  Will you hear it?  At 60 dB it is probably borderline for most people.I can't recommend the Emotiva XPA-DR2 due to its high distortion.  Otherwise, it is a very tempting package.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Every night I have dinner, wait for the sun to do down some and go pulling weeds in the garden.

      "A member asked me a while ago to test the ultra cheap ($18) UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier on Amazon. To make the clickbait title work , I omitted the cost of the external power supply you need to bring yourself. What you get is a three board assembly:It took less than 5 minutes to put the heatsink on the main class D amp chip and sandwich the main board with the top and bottom.  The chip used must be for smart speakers as it has voice prompts when you change inputs.  Speaking of that, it has Bluetooth (which I did not test), analog and USB in.  The little heatsink has no air flow and in testing, it got quite hot to touch at times.For testing, I used my lab power supply and set the output voltage to 24 volts (max spec).  The supply has  3 Amps max current.  Amplifier is rated for dual 50 watts at that voltage input.UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier MeasurementsI started testing with analog input with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain:Considering the price, this is not half bad:I kludged up a USB type A to type A cable and ran the dashboard test again:As you see performance is not as good as analog input.  Worse yet, just a few seconds later, it lost stability and would no longer work reliably.  If I powered it down, it would work for a second or two and then go crazy again. It may be a design issue or my setup.  Either way, I could only continue with analog input testing.Noise floor is high as you can see in the FFT graphs above:Crosstalk managed to be worse than the worst I have tested so far:Multitone shows increased distortion at both ends of the spectrum:The most important test for class D amps shows strong load dependency:So the tonality you get will depend on speaker you hook up to it.As usual, we fall way short of stated power levels:8 Ohm performance was a bit better:Response vs frequency is smooth but that may be due to high noise floor which masks distortion:Amplifier Listening TestsI hooked up one channel to my Infinity Reference 253 speaker and starting to listen.  There was a lot more power than I expectedly, likely due to only having to drive one channel.  The sound was surprisingly good until you cranked it to max volume.  Speaking of which, if I paused input, the last 25% of the volume range produced tweeter hiss that was audible to about 1 meter/3 feet.I was very satisfied with subjective performance until I landed on two clips, both of which were busy with both bass and treble notes.  On these two tracks, the sound was very distorted at almost all volume levels.  High frequencies would get gritty and distorted and bass response was bad as well.  I power cycled the unit and let it cool and it seemed to play well for a couple of seconds and then would get distorted.  It may be that the crest factor is too low causing the amp to drive hard most of the time with these two tracks.  And then it overheats and distorts.ConclusionsThe first amplifier I ever built (with my brother when we were 10 or 11 years old) was this massive board and produced only 10 watts a channel.  It also cost us many months of allowance.  Compare that to this amplifier which for the price of a fast food meal for two, gives you stereo sound that most of the time is impressively good.  If it did not distort on those two channels, I would say you could build an amp with two of them and be in business.Given the distortion/heat issue, I can't recommend the UWAYKEY amplifier.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Ashly NE8250 professional 8-channel networked power amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,386.The look and controls are fine. It is going in a rack after all. Note that back connections are all phoenix blocks:You can make your own cables or buy adapters (I made mine). There is a nice network UI interface and app.Ashly NE8250 MeasurementsAll measurements are from channels 3 and 4.  Let's start with our dashboard:That is huge amount of harmonic distortion, placing the amp almost at the bottom of our SINAD list:Strangely, in a good way, noise floor is low:Frequency response droops at either end but surprisingly it is not load dependent despite being Class D design:Crosstalk is fine:Multitone shows poor performance that we would expect:You buy these amps for power so let's see how it does at 4 ohm:Ouch!  That distortion curve is crazy.  It almost act like a tube amp or something!  Distortion is so high when it clips that when we measure at 1%, we actually get less power:Switching to 8 ohm doesn't help:Sweeping the frequencies we see this pronounced hump:So my guess is that it is a class G design but company says Class D.ConclusionsThe distortion in this amplifier is just out of control.  It is also not every powerful on a per channel basis.  So I don't see it having a good application for home use in either main or sub amplifier.  It is also expensive so I don't see the value in it either.  Then again the owner said they come up much cheaper on ebay so maybe that would be some motivation to buy it.I can't recommend the Ashly NE8250.  Your ears deserve better!

      " Earthquake XJ-300ST stereo amplifier. It was kindly donated by a member for testing. It costs US $462.83 from the company website.I like the compact packaging and old school but solid feeling switchgear.  Likewise, having a low-pass filter (no doubt to drive subs for which they are famous), filter corner frequency and phase come in handy.  And of course the integrated volume control.  Back panel is typical with the exception of crossing terminals (for bridging):12 volt trigger is icing on the cake.Unit runs is a \"class J\" amplifier and was cool and comfortable during testing.  Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:We have massive mains spike which I could hardly reduce no matter what I did.  I am assuming it is internal leakage.  Can't figure out why one channel is so much more distorted than the other.  Averaging the two, the amp falls in \"poor\" category of all tested with a SINAD of 59:Frequency response showed strong roll off at both ends of the spectrum:There is a note about a 15 Hz high pass but nothing about the top end.  I tested the programmable lowpass by more or less setting it to 80 Hz and got this:Crosstalk is very poor:SNR was poor likely due to high levels of power supply/mains noise:Power is modest:I have no idea how they have arrived at their power spec:Finally, here is the 8 ohm performance:ConclusionsNot much to hang your head on here other than the compact size and functionality.  Not sure how it is suitable for subwoofer duty when it has so little power.  Can't recommend it.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Crown XLi 800 pro Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The XLi 800 costs just US $269 including free shipping.  Hard to imagine so much electronics from a brand name company selling for so little.NOTE: my company (Madrona Digital) is a dealer for Harman and sells a lot of Crown amplifiers.EDIT: I left out the letter \"B\" out of class AB below.  I don't know anyone who is building class B audio amplifiers.Unlike some of the switching amplifiers from Crown, this is a class AB amplifier with seemingly linear power supply as it is quite heavy.  From the outside though, it look like countless other commercial amplifiers:There are two gain controls in addition to very useful clipping indicators.  Speaking of clipping, there is a compressor in there that limits power output to maximum no matter how much you increase its input.  It is a nice feature that is surely there to stop the amp from stressing while saving a speaker from blowing up due to a mistake upstream.The back panel is as you expect:In use the unit never even got warm.  I had headphones on so did not take note of when/if the fans came on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet's see how the XLi 800 does in our usual dashboard at 5 watt output into 4 ohm using a 1 kHz tone:Ouch!  We have very high distortion of 0.13 to 0.16%.  The spec is 0.5% so it is within what they say but this is very high.  Translated into SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) our 57 dB value sinks into the bottom range of all amplifiers measured so far:Signal to noise ratio at 5 watt is nothing to write home about either:Frequency response is fairly flat and predictable:Power into 4 ohm relative to THD+N gives us:That is a lot of power.  And tremendous value at just 50 cents per watt. As one would predict, we lose some of that into 8 ohm:Determining maximum power and peak with 1% THD+N gives us these:We have fair bit of headroom there.I had a hard time measuring power across full spectrum at a given THD+N due to the amp limiting power (and hence distortion).  Only managed to capture 0.9% and 0.5% THD+N power here:As we would expect, we get less power at low frequencies because they tax the power supply more.  Oh, the text on graph is wrong: should say 1% not 0.1%.Finally, here is our frequency sensitivity relative to power and distortion+noise:Best distortion is usually at lower frequencies and here, the improvement is quite good at 20 Hz.  Alas, we also get less power before clipping (orange).Otherwise, the lines are quite predictable with no funny non-linearity mid span as we get with some amplifiers.ConclusionsCrown advertises the XLi 800 as a PA (Public Address) amplifier and that is what it is.  Distortion and noise is kept in check just enough to do the job with tons of power for so little money.  I suspect it is reliably too given the dual fans to keep it cool.  And the market it is being sold into.For hi-fi use, it is not something I would consider to drive full-range speakers.  For subwoofer or active woofer duty, it would be fine.As it is, I can't recommend the XLi 800.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Spent 4+ hours mowing our field today.

      " SMSL Q5 Pro DAC and stereo integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Q5 Pro costs US $140 from Amazon with Prime shipping.The sample sent to me is \"well used:\"If you were a real audiophile, you would think those scratches change the cabinet resonances leading to less black backgrounds, micro detail and PRAT.  But since you are not, let's read on.  Here is the back panel:The owner sent me two power supplies.  The other one outputs 24 volts but since it says on the back the limit is 19, I went with this one.  Heaven knows if I blew it up, I could not buy another one and scratch it up the same way this one is!  Strangely if I squint, the fuzzy picture on SMSL website shows the other power supply.As you see, you have both digital and analog inputs.  I tested both as you see below.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet's start with analog input performance:Well, that is not good.  One channel is producing far more distortion.  And noise level is quite high.  Switching to USB input improves the good channel significantly:The bad channel is insisting on producing far more distortion.  Averaging the two, we get a SINAD score that is pretty much at the bottom of our rankings:From here on, I stuck with USB input since it performs better.  Frequency response was refreshingly good:Power into 4 ohm load shows poor response:Doesn't get much better into 8 ohm:And we are way off the spec.  But that is typical.  Or maybe it needs the higher voltage power supply.Thermal stabilityNot much was changing after power up:ConclusionsIt is one thing to have random performance when an amp is $50 or so.  But once you get to $140, I expect better than what SMSL Q5 Pro delivers.  If you want a little baby amp, get the SMSL SA100.  It behaves better and is much cheaper.

      " Rockville RPA16 \"Professional\" power amplifier. It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me. It costs US $390.The amp has a \"peak\" spec of 10,000 watts!  No, there is no typo in there. It weights 40 pounds/18 KG so it does have some meat to it.  You can probably see the bolt that holds the power transformer on top left. So no switching power supply at least.  Back panel shows nice sub out option:The fan is variable speed and is mostly quiet at idle.  But even under modest power it spools up as temps climb, making a slightly whining sound:The front controls are analog actually but notched, making it harder to select an exact value.  They are out of sync with each other so one notch is not the same as the other.  The displayed amount is also off by a couple of dB (27 dB shown above was actually 29 dB).  There is a built-in limiter and clipping light.Rockville RPA16 MeasurementsLet's jump right in with our dashboard:That is very odd set of spikes in low frequencies.  We have the mains 60 Hz noise but also 70 Hz.  At this power level though, spray of distortion at -62 dB sets SINAD though, causing it to rank as one of the worse tested:Its score of 55 dB is so low that it pulled down our overall median by 1 dB to 78!Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts, likely due to that power supply noise.  But there is so much power that when you push it, the ratio is not bad:Multitone test shows that distortion naturally gets worse at higher frequencies:Frequency response is nice and load independent indicating a non-switching amplifier:You have a choice of two roll offs for sub output.  Strangely both boost the gain as well:Let's see how accurate the power specs are (2 X 1500 watts at 4 ohm):Naturally we don't get there but this is one powerful amplifier, generating nearly 1500 watts with both channels combined.Letting distortion go up and with shorter term signal we get even more of it:I don't think we have measured this much power before, have we?Even at 8 ohm you have a ton of power:As noted though, noise floor is high, again, I think the worst measured.  Distortion actually doesn't set in until 100+ watts.Checking for frequency vs power and distortion we see orderly response:If you are using it for sub, you want to use the above number, rather than the 1 kHz power tests shown earlier.  Fortunately this is still a ton of power considering dual channels are driven.Finally, I ran a wideband spectrum test to confirm the design is not switching:And it is not.  There is also good filtering to push the noise levels down so low above a few hundred kilohertz. ConclusionsThis is an interesting take on a pro amplifier to go with non-switching design.  This makes the amp extremely heavy compared to competition yet, the price is maintained and absurdly low.  Copious amount of power is available if you can tolerate some fan noise.Due to high level of noise I can't recommend the Rockville RPA16.  But you are welcome to choose otherwise based on other factors.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Carver M-1.5t vintage stereo amplifier. It was kindly sent to me by a member.The M-1.5t came in an era where rack mounting meant serious business. As a Carver (receiver) owner myself, I remember all the advertising for the M-1.5t.  Oddly, there is no power switch anywhere:I got a chuckle seeing that monster cable tag:And found the power specs ridiculously complicated but I am sure was appreciated by the aficionadas of the amp:The front LEDs don't light up until it is putting out a lot of power.  I liked the top LED which was the limiting lights and nice protection circuit which kept the unit on no matter what.  This amp was part of Carver \"Magnetic Field\" amplification line which varied the power supply voltage to substantially reduce the size and weight of the transformer.  As a result, the unit ran quite cool, maybe a bit warmer than modern class D but still, impressive for the time.The owner has replaced the capacitors in this unit.  Otherwise I think it is untouched.Carver M-1.5t MeasurementsI can see why there is no power switch as the amp did not stabilize for the 14 minutes I measured it:The level of instability is quite large, going beyond 10 db variation in SINAD!  I am used to seeing 1 or 2 dB, but nothing at this level.When I had the unit connected, and before I fed it signal, I could see constant switching noise:Not sure what that is about.  Here is our dashboard at 5 watts with 1 kHz tone:Third harmonic dominates distortion profile and with it, SINAD (relative sum of noise+distortion).  Average SINAD of 55 dB for both channels is far, far below that median for all amplifiers I have tested to date (around 79 dB).  On top of distortion, we have massive pulse train which oddly starts at 40 Hz.  So definitely not very clean.SNR though was better:Frequency response was nice, flat and extended:Crosstalk was \"OK:\"Multitone shows more than usual increase in distortion vs frequency:Front of the unit says it has low feedback which is likely responsible for this.Claim to fame is lots of power so let's see how it does:We see a distinct jump in distortion at around 66 watts which must be when it switches to higher power supply voltage.  Allowing for copious amount of distortion, there is good bit of power at 273 watts.  Here is the same at 8 ohm:Now let's test peak performance:There definitely is a lot of headroom, allowing power to almost double!  The 600 watt number and such must have been at higher distortion levels than what I allow.Testing for frequency sensitivity we again see the higher distortion at higher frequencies:20 Hz performance also dropped with rising distortion at just 20 watts.Finally, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:ConclusionsIt is nice to test products that were iconic during my youth with state of the art measurements that didn't even exist then.  Using that, we see that in noise and distortion the M-1.5t is outgunned by vast number of amplifiers today.  However, it produces copious amount of power which would have been even more impressive then.  The efficiency rivals class D amps today which was unheard of at the time.Looking online, I see that non-upgraded but working units go for $500 or so.  They seem to be a decent alternative to pro class D amp if you have a soft spot in your heart for vintage amplifiers.  -----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " SMSL SA100 Stereo Audio Amplifier with analog and Bluetooth inputs.  It was kindly sent to me by the member @lunagreenjp who is a distributor for SMSL.  The SA100 costs just US $73.99 on Amazon including shipping.Form the outside the SA100 matches its sibling, the M100 DAC:Pushing the power button multiple times lets you select between Aux RCA in and Bluetooth.  Pushing and holding the volume control lets you select Bass and Treble amounts.  I was surprised that the unit had shipped with both set to max instead of zero.The volume control works well and overall, you feel like you are getting more than the $74 price indicates.Here is the back panel:An external \"laptop style\" switching supply powers the unit.  It is almost as large as the SA100 itself although not as thick.I was pleased that my rather large and unwieldy banana speakers securely mated with the jacks on the SA100.Overall, my impression is positive about the look and feel of this little, and I mean little, integrated amplifier.The heart of the unit is TPA3116D2  class-D amplifier IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect it is made for Bluetooth speakers and such.  In use the SA100 ran cool no matter how hard I pushed it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:As is typical of amplifiers with volume control, one can get slightly different results depending on how you set the input level relative to volume control on the unit itself.  The above is with volume control set to -1 I think.High distortion dominates the output resulting in one of the worst numbers we have measured with respect to SINAD (noise+distortion relative to main signal):Frequency response droops at both end some:The sharp drop after 20 kHz tells me that input is perhaps digitized to provide tone control?Signal to noise ratio \"OK\" for the class:Measuring distortion and noise relative to output power with 8 and 4 ohm gets us:Distortion sets it very early and climbs after that.  Specified power ratings are quite inflated as is typical of these chip amps.The sharp filter limit the measurement of harmonic distortion when we sweep frequency and power level:The red curve for example is for 20 kHz but since we can't see any of its harmonics, it looks artificially low.Here is the spectrum of a 1 kHz tone without any kind of filter (the above had filters):Speaking of filter, even though I used an AES-17 filter to get rid of ultrasonic noise, the level was still so high as to confuse my Audio Precision analyzer.  It would often not be able to capture the input signal properly.ConclusionsIf we measured the SMSL SA100 on an absolute level, it would rank horribly of course.  But I don't think that is proper here.  The SA100 costs so little and probably gets use in tertiary applications such as a workshop amp to drive cheap speakers you don't mind getting stolen or destroyed.  And maybe for casual desktop use.------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Today was election day.  Just about everything on the ballot was another tax.

      " Carver Crimson 275 tube stereo power amplifier. It was purchased new by member @paulbottlehead and given to me for testing. It costs US $2750.I really like the way the amplifier looks.  The burgundy color is attractive as is the handle.  On the latter, the unit is very light though so the handle while handy, is not necessary to lift the thing.  Back panel shows high quality connectors:The tubes, four Tun-sol KT120, pair of 12AT7W and 12AX7 can in their original boxes for the owner installation. Went to open one of the small tube boxes but found nothing in it!  Worried, I looked around and it had come out of its box and was just floating in the larger box that they all came in.Prior to installation of tubes I had something to investigate: there was clearly something loose in there, rattling around.  So I took the back panel off to find a metal screw rolling around in there:Not sure where it was supposed to go.  There is a hole for something above the second fuse from the bottom but I think that would for a nut.I did not like lack of safety (earth) ground from the IEC terminal:Instead, there is some kind of local, star grounding referenced to neutral using a resistor.  That naturally won't work for safety purposes.  With that power supply board mounted vertically with voltages as high as 300+ volts, I sure as heck would want this metal case grounded.  I don't care what audio/electrical problem they were trying to solve there.  I want a safe product first and foremost.  Naturally there is no safety/regulatory certification which I expect a company with the name \"Carver\" to be able to afford.I got a kick out of the beefy speaker terminals but ultra-thin wires leading to it!  Yes, the lengths are short and at this wattage is probably fine but from \"optics\" point of view, you would want to use something better than hair thin wiring (see gray and red wires).I was sad to see the VU meter glued to the case:I realize welding a couple of threaded stand-offs to the case costs money but at this price, I expect such.  The meter is not backlit which was another disappointment.  But was useful for checking bias which was right at the spec at 100 milliamps.So nice looks but under the skin, a number of concerns.Carver Crimson 275 MeasurementsI usually let amplifiers warm up some and watch their behavior and also let things stabilize before measurements.  Manual states that bias can be checked after 20 minutes so I let it run for that long and a bit more:Note that the vertical scale is only 3 dB so don't be alarmed by the variations.  Generally speaking, unit is table after a couple of minutes of warm up. But it is fascinating to see performance gradually get worse as it kept warming up (again, at micro level).So next comes our usual dashboard.  My Audio Precision analyzer by default has floating (non-earth connected) RCA terminals.  But I had to override that by grounding it as I observed oscillations (frequent occurrence with some amplifiers).  No other attempt at grounding made a difference in power supply/mains hum:The power supply noise really dirties up the FFT spectrum but looking past that, we see that the low SINAD (sum of noise and distortion) is dominated by distortion.  Unlike the common reputation for tubes, distortion is third harmonic for the most part, not second.  Naturally the high level of distortion places the 275 very low in our scale, second only to one other amp ever tested:Company spec is quite good for noise level relative to full power.  I could not get that without a-weighting:But applying the a-weighting filter and with it, getting rid of power supply noise, we do essentially get there:Crosstalk was poor:Frequency response has an odd shape and good bit of loss at high frequencies with 4 ohm load:Output impedance is high enough that is combining with the load to change the high frequency roll off.  Things get better as such with an 8 ohm load:There is an RC filter on the speaker terminals.  Wonder if that is what is providing the roll off.Using 32 tones to simulate \"music\" we see a high level of \"grass\" which would obscure any low level detail:Notice how the worse performance is in low frequencies.There has been controversy regarding ability of the 275 to produce its rated power of 75 watts so let's start with 4 ohm load as I usually do:The amplifier produced 29 watts after which it blew its 3 amp mains fuse.  Fortunately two spares were provided, allowing me to continue testing.  Company specs distortion at \"less than 1%\" so let's see power at that rating:Very dramatic difference between 1 or 2 second power (used for left side) vs short bursts.  There is clearly a capacity problem to produce sustained power.  Note that this is at 1 kHz as is industry convention.  Note that allowing just 1% THD reduces the power even more than what I allowed in my power sweep.I was surprised to not see selectable output impedance for 8 ohm load so proceed with the test as is:We blew the second fuse but now power is much more healthy at 60 watts.Hoping to not blow the last fuse, I kept the max power level lower as I changed frequencies:Performance was \"reasonable\" (for at tube) but once we got down to 20 Hz, it became super erratic and blew the third fuse.   It produced only 14 wats which is well short of 30 watts it produced at higher frequencies.  I would have wanted to test at more frequencies but it was past midnight and I did not feel like hunting around to find my own replacement fuses.ConclusionsAs a Carver owner of 40 years (solid state), I have a soft spot for the designer.  Alas, while I like some things about this amp like the nice looking paint, I am very disappointed in the QC and construction of the unit with respect to safety.  Loose screws and glued meters should not be part of a nears $3,000 amplifier.  Measured performance is awful of course and one would expect that for many audiophile tube amps.  But having third harmonic be dominant blows away the story of why that is audibly a good thing.  Clearly the specifications of the amplifier is incorrect for 4 ohm load (company even allows usage for 2 ohm loads!).  And low frequency behavior is very poor.Unless you are going to buy the Carver Crimson 275 to just look at it, I can't recommend it for many reasons stated above.  I expect more from the man, the legend....P.S. It was nice to take a break from drying up our flooded home and get back to some \"normalcy\" with testing this amp.  It cheered me up to be \"working\" again and doing what I enjoy.EDIT: We have had two formal responses from Bob Carver:Carver Crimson 275 Review (Tube Amp)What baffles me is that to make this amp safe and hum free doesn’t take much effort.

      " Carver Raven 350 tube monoblock amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and (I think) costs US $4,750.The 350 is not a bad looking amp. It has the same \"orange peel\" paint job of the previous Carver 275 amplifier I reviewed.  At 42 pounds, the unit is pretty heavy.  With all the weight in the back, the front handle is kind of useless when it comes to lifting it.There is an XLR input but I believe it is for convenience and performs the same as RCA. I measured the DC resistance of the 4 and 8 ohm terminals (after the measurements) and realized they are both the same!  Here I was switching back and forth between them.   Anyway, measured DC resistance is 0.47 ohm. The 1-2 ohm tap has a lower DC resistance of about 0.3 ohm.Unlike the 275 amplifier, the fuses did not blow and the amp survived my sweep tests.  Bias is to be set at \"80\" on the front dial and that was the case when I powered on the unit.There is a gain control but you are advised to set it to max which is what I did for testing.There is a flip switch in the front which changes the amount of feedback.  I tested the amp in both settings.Here are the specs:Carver 350 MeasurementsLet's start with high-feedback performance using XLR input:There is copious amount of distortion causing SINAD to be dominated by it.  At 44.1, it ranks as the second worst amplifier ever tested:It even performed worse than the Carver 275 which had a SINAD of 46.  Switching to lower feedback doesn't make things that much worse:Note that gain is reduced and therefore, volume will be different. This makes AB testing tricky.  Here is a more detailed FFT showing the small difference between low and high feedback:Notice how distortion is made up of both 2nd and 3rd harmonics so you can't make the argument that it is \"2nd harmonic goodness.\"As noted, RCA performance is the same as XLR:Power supply 60 Hz noise in both cases causes severe intermodulation higher up in frequency. No amount of grounding impacted that so it is endemic tot he design.Noise performance is decent for type of amp it is:Intermodulation distortion rears its ugly head again in multitone test:I don't know how anyone could hear more \"detail\" with such an amp where so much of the music signal will get lost in the distortion \"grass.\"Frequency response should be flat but it is not:It naturally will have load dependency due to output impedance.Let's see the power situation as we had serious shortfall in the 275 amp:We don't meet the spec there but come closer with 8 ohm:Back to 4 ohm, here is our 1% THD (double the company spec) max and burst power:We seem to get the same shortfall.  There is momentary reservoir though allowing the peak output to shoot way up.  This was not always consistent though.I also tested 2 ohm capability:You are still current limited so no more power.Changing the test frequency gives us the following power curves:There is some instability at 20 Hz and fairly significant power drop.  This points to power supply not having enough capacity as the lower frequency taxes it for longer period.  Some drop occurs in every amplifier by the way so it is a matter of how much.Finally, the amplifier warms up quickly and is pretty stable:Testing occurred after this warm up.ConclusionsWhat an upside down the world of audio is. Folks want to pay so much more to get dirtier sound.  You want dirty?  The Carver 350 gives it to you. Even at 5 watts there is copious amount of harmonic distortion.  Power supply mixes with that at such high level that it creates its own spread of distortion. A video must come with these amps that hypnotizes you into thinking you are getting great sound....I can't recommend the Carver 350 monoblock amplifier.-----------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: @@@audiosciencereview\n",
      " Pass ACA Class A stereo power amplifier.  It is a DIY design by the famous designer, Nelson Pass, meant to be starter amplifier for people new to audio electronics to build.  There are many kits available. The one loaned to me from a long time friend of the forum.  The kit seems to cost around US $320 or so.The ACA sample I received comes in an attractive black case:The design is a Mosfet output stage with a single stage buffer.  Very modest level of feedback (9 dB?) is provided to keep distortion somewhat under control.  As you will see, the gain is very low requiring full 2 volt of DACs to drive it to max power.Here is the back side:I did not mess with it but I am assuming the single XLR allows bridged mono operation.Power is provided by a very beefy external switching power supply which outputs 24 volts with up to 5 amps or 120 watts.  All of that is put to \"use\" in generating copious amount of heat.  I was told by the owner to let it warm up for a few minutes.  As you will see in the measurements, this actually made the performance worse, not better.Overall, this is a very nice package if it performs.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard with 5 watt output into 4 ohm.  Normally this is well below the max power but not in this case as we see later:Gosh... What happened to aiming for high fidelity?  This is a distortion-factory if there ever was one.  The notion that it is mostly second harmonic does not hold true either.  Welcome to the bottom of our amplifier ratings:Let's dig into distortion spectrum at lower power level of just 1 watt:Second harmonic is more dominant than at 5 watt but it doesn't stay there that long.  Here it is at 2 watts:Our 32-tone signal resembling \"music\" paints an ugly picture as a result:I was pleasantly surprised how quiet the unit is though:Frequency response is also very well extended:You may be able to make an AM radio out of this thing.  Back to ugliness, here is our power versus distortion+noise into 8 ohm load:Oh gosh again.... Only 7 watts of power with SINAD of 38 dB?Things don't get much better with 4 ohm load:We now have distortion climbing into near 10% category at max power of just 7.4 watts/channel.There was little variation of response with respect to frequency:Distortion level is so high that it is masking secondary sources of it.Making sure this unit matches the reference, I compared them to what Nelson Pass has published:We are getting very good agreement.  So this is what the unit is supposed to do.  Nelson stays with 1 watt output which shows the performance to be better.EDIT: I noted on the dashboard that the gain was much lower than the spec.  I am told that version 1.6 which I tested now has a spec of 10 dB for gain so we are good.EDIT 2: See this link for bridged mode measurements: TestsIs\n"

       "'I used my Audio Precision SYS2722 system (see the January 2008 \"As We See It\" and www.ap.com) to measure the Octave V 40 SE. After installing the four KT88 output tubes per the setup sheet, and before doing any measurements, I let the amplifier warm up for a morning. I then checked the bias voltage for the KT88s using the front-panel rotary switch and the LED display. All four LEDs illuminated green, which, according to the excellent owners manual, means \"Setting is OK.\" I took a complete set of measurements with the amplifier used alone, then repeated most of the testing with the auxiliary Black Box capacitor bank connected.The maximum voltage gain into 8 ohms was the same with or without the Black Box outboard capacitance bank, at 38.75dB, and the V 40 SE preserved absolute polarity; ie, was non-inverting. The input impedance at low and middle frequencies was, at 61.5k ohms, usefully higher than the specified 50k ohms, and was still 51k ohms at the top of the audioband. The output impedance is specified as 2 ohms; however, the measured impedance was significantly higher than this, at 3.3 ohms at 20Hz, 4.3 ohms at 1kHz, and 3.8 ohms at 20kHz. I was surprised that these measured impedances were not lowered by the Black Box.With these high output-impedance values, the variation in frequency response with our standard simulated loudspeaker, resulting from the Ohms law interaction between the amplifiers output impedance and the manner in which the load impedance varies with frequency, reached ±2.1dB (fig.1, gray trace). The two channels matched very closely in the audioband into 8 ohms (left channel blue, right red), though the left channel rolled off a little earlier above 20kHz. The ultrasonic rolloff is very fast, and there is a sign of a slight peak developing between 30 and 50kHz in the right channel into lower impedances (magenta and green traces). This correlates with some critically damped overshoot—one half-cycle of overshoot and no ringing—with a 10kHz squarewave (fig.2).Fig.1 Octave V 40 SE, frequency response with volume control at its maximum at 2.83V into: simulated loudspeaker load (gray), 8 ohms (left channel blue, right red), 4 ohms (left cyan, right magenta), 2 ohms (green) (1dB/vertical div.).Fig.2 Octave V 40 SE, small-signal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohms.Channel separation (not shown) was modest, at >65dB below 1kHz, and just 38dB in both directions at 20kHz. (The specification is 40dB.) I measure an integrated amplifiers signal/noise ratio in the worst-possible case, with its input shorted to ground but the volume control set to its maximum. The wideband, unweighted ratio under these conditions, ref. 2.83V or 1W into 8 ohms and with the Black Box connected, was 77.6dB in the left channel and 78.5dB in the right. The ratios improved to 79.9 and 84.3dB, respectively, when the measurement bandwidth was restricted to the audioband, and to 84.2 and 87dB when A-weighted. Spectral analysis of the V 40 SEs output while it drove a 1kHz tone at 1W into 8 ohms (fig.3) revealed that the left channels slightly poorer noise performance was due to a higher level of 60Hz in that channel, though at –83dB (0.007%), this wont be audible.Fig.3 Octave V 40 SE, spectrum of 1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms, DC–1kHz (linear frequency scale).The V 40 SEs maximum output power is specified at 40Wpc into 4 ohms (13dBW). Figs. 4 and 5 plot the THD+noise percentage in the amplifiers output against output power into 8 and 4 ohms, respectively. We define clipping as when the THD+N reaches 1%, and these two graphs indicate that, into both impedances, the Octave clips at 26.5W (14.2 and 11.2dBW, respectively). Adding the Black Box didnt increase the power at clipping. However, the V 40 SE reaches its specified power into 4 ohms at 1.12% THD+N, and the THD+N is still just 1.18% at 50Wpc into 4 ohms (14dBW), which is when the amplifier starts to hard clip (shown by the knee in the trace). Below 50W, the THD+N rises linearly with increasing power, this due to the low level of loop negative feedback used.Fig.4 Octave V 40 SE, distortion (%) vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohms.Fig.5 Octave V 40 SE, distortion (%) vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohms.The distortion below 1W is low, especially into higher impedances. Fig.6 plots the percentage of THD+N against frequency at 2.83V into 8, 4, and 2 ohms. The distortion rises at the frequency extremes, as expected from the circuit topology, but only into 2 ohms (gray trace) does it become problematically high. Fortunately, the distortion content at low powers is predominantly the subjectively innocuous second harmonic, even into low impedances (fig.7), though it is joined at higher powers by some high-order harmonics (fig.8). High-frequency intermodulation distortion (fig.9) was what Id expected from the Octaves THD-vs-frequency behavior, with the 1kHz difference component—resulting from an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 10Wpc into 8 ohms—reaching –50dB (0.3%). There is a peculiar rise in the power-supply–rated spuriae in the mid-treble in this graph, which was taken with the Black Box connected. Disconnecting the Black Box didnt change this behavior, nor did experimenting with all the various ways of grounding the amplifier to the Audio Precision test system.Fig.6 Octave V 40 SE, THD+N (%) vs frequency at 2.83V into: 8 ohms (left channel blue, right red), 4 ohms (left cyan, right magenta), 2 ohms (gray).Fig.7 Octave V 40 SE, 1kHz waveform at 1W into 4 ohms (top), 0.208% THD+N; distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out (bottom, not to scale).Fig.8 Octave V 40 SE, spectrum of 50Hz sinewave, DC–1kHz, at 10W into 8 ohms (linear frequency scale).Fig.9 Octave V 40 SE, HF intermodulation spectrum, DC–24kHz, 19+20kHz at 10W peak into 8 ohms (linear frequency scale).Other than that anomaly, Octaves V 40 SE measured as I would expect from a traditional design that uses a pair of KT88 output tubes for each channel. And, like Octaves RE 290, a 100Wpc power amplifier favorably reviewed by Erick Lichte in our January 2013 issue, the V 40 SE is constructed to an impressively high standard.—John Atkinson          '"

       "[\" Topping LA90 Discrete balanced stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $799.The case is the same as the IC-based Topping LA90 which is fine with me given its high quality look and feel.  The power switch doubles as input selector once the unit is on.  Volume control can be bypassed using switch in the back:As before, power is provided by a hefty, 64 volt switching power supply rated at 4 amps (likely provides higher current in short bursts).  The amplifier as you see is all balanced with three inputs.  You have a selection of low and high gains (although the latter should really be called medium gain).  It can be bridged and nicely tolerates even 4 ohm loads in that mode.  Trigger is provided to enable one power switch to turn on a series of devices.Note that this is a traditional amplifier and not class D.  There is no remote so if you need that, you have to use a DAC/pre-amp with that capability.Topping LA90 Discrete MeasurementsThere is a lot to measure here given the fact that we have dual gains and bridge mode.  Let's work our way through it starting with low gain in stereo mode:Incredibly, the LA90 Discrete matches the performance of its IC based unit, landing on its perch on top of all other amplifiers ever tested:Switching to high gain costs you a few dBs but you are still ahead the competition:So feel free to use this mode.  Noise performance continues to be superb:Frequency response is flat of course and load independent:Crosstalk is better than average amplifier but is a step down from the regular LA90:Multitone showcases the superbly low distortion levels:Let's see how we are doing in power department starting with 4 ohms:We wind up good bit more power at 70 watts (vs 56 watts for normal LA90) while giving up nothing in spectacular noise and distortion department.  Allowing for more distortion gets us more power:8 Ohm performance follows the same path:Tests so far have been at 1 kHz (other than multitone) so let's vary that and see what happens:In a word, wow!  The amplifier simply doesn't care what frequency you throw out it!  This is a quite a step ahead of normal LA90 which itself was state of the art.Power on is silent but off may create a faint noise depending on your speaker sensitivity:Warm up showed one channel struggling a bit but later I found the power connector not fully tight so maybe that was the cause:Regardless, it behaved correctly after a minute.Topping LA90 Discrete Bridged MeasurementsAs with normal LA90, bridge mode still provides superb performance:The name of the game is power though so let's see what we get into 4 ohm:Notice how we get more power but distortion is nowhere to be found until we clip.Wow!  This makes a great case for using a pair of these amps.  You get so much power out of each one, rivalling much larger amplifiers.Reactive Load TestingThe LA90 has a very sharp clipping point.  This means that it goes from vanishingly low distortion to full clipping.  Combine this with aggressive protection circuit which shuts the unit off and you have the make up of a system that can't be measured in batch mode as my Powercube setup uses.  If I set the voltage for 8 ohm load, then it causes the amp to shut down when driven at 4 ohm.  Good news is that the amplifier doesn't care about reactive loads.  Here are the results for 8 ohm for example:Code:Maximum Output4/11/202312:13 AMMaximum Output Level ResultsSelected Load    Ch1 (Vrms)    Ch2 (Vrms)    8 Ohm; 60 deg Capacitive    21.2    21.3    8 Ohm; 30 deg Capacitive    21.1    21.2    8 Ohm; 0 deg Resistive    21.0    21.0    8 Ohm; 30 deg Inductive    20.2    20.3    8 Ohm; 60 deg Inductive    20.9    21.0I could not get a similar output at 4 ohm due to limitation of the instrumentation as stated above.  But if I drove the parameters manually, I could get it to tolerate reactive loads just as well.Selecting 2 ohm caused the protection circuit to kick in.  I didn't have time to mess with that.I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get this test done with the amplifier being pushed to clipping and shut down probably 50 to 100 times.  Even though the case got pretty warm, the amp continued to function without complaining. ConclusionsTraditionally in high-end audio when a company says they are using discrete designs, I get prepared for bad performance.  Topping once again proves that this is no barrier for their designers.  The discreate LA90 not only matches the exemplary performance of the IC based LA90, but betters it in power handling, producing more power (a needed feature).  Pushing noise and distortion down in our top tier performance is very hard but Topping has no problem maintaining its significant lead over even best of the best amplifiers.  Their skills and execution in this regard leaves me speechless.Needless to say, it is my absolute pleasure to add Topping LA90 Discrete to my recommended list.  Today is a happy day!  P.S.  Power amplifiers are least reliable audio products (due to high currents and voltages involved).  New designs sometimes need to prove themselves in this regard.  So if you are risk averse, please don't be the first to purchase this amplifier.\",\n",
       " ' Topping LA90 integrated amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $800.I must say, this is one interesting industrial design. Everything oozes style despite the diminutive package.  This aspect continues in the operation of the unit with the sound of the relays solidly clicking indicating something good is going to happen.  Here is the side view:While quite solid, you can pick it up with one hand.  The small size is aided by a massive external switching power supply:Here are its ratings:Back to the unit, you can see three balanced inputs.  Volume control can be bypassed although I did not do so for my testing. You can also operate LA90 in bridged mono mode.  There is also 12 volt trigger.There are to gain settings.  One at 10 dB and another at 20 dB (nominal).Topping LA90 MeasurementsThese are non-bridged mode measurements.  Bridged setup follows this section.  Let\\'s start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm in low gain mode:I don\\'t need to tell you that this is a stunning level of achievement.  We have a power amplifier producing almost the same SINAD as a state of the art DAC!  Using this number, LA90 grabs the top spot with ease with a nice gap to boot:Here it is zoomed:You might be thinking that it can only do so with low gain but that is not true.  Even in high gain performance is spectacular:It would still achieve top spot in our rankings and achieve full audible transparency.Not only is distortion vanishingly low, so is noise level:Frequency response is flat and wide as expected:Being class AB design, it has no load dependency.Crosstalk is incredibly good although it loses a tiny bit relative to last champ of amplifiers:Multitone test shows the very low distortion levels:Let\\'s see how much power we have:So power is modest in non-bridged mode.  But note how good the high gain mode is so I would feel just fine using that for operation of the unit if you need to.  Allowing distortion to rise to 1% naturally gets us more power:Here is 8 ohm:Oops.  \"High Power\" should be \"High Gain.\"Changing frequencies shows the same excellent performance:Despite being pushed deep into clipping, the amplifier did not complain until I got to 20 Hz where its over temperature shut it down.Finally, you don\\'t need any warm up:Topping LA90 Bridged Mode PerformanceA shorting wire is provided to connect the two negative speaker bindings together allowing bridged mode from the top two posts.  Here is our dashboard again:Performance is still exceptional.  Here is our SNR:Due to more power available now, we cross the amazing 140 dB SNR threshold.  What this says is that even if you play at 140 dB, the noise level will be at or below threshold of hearing!  Of course there is not enough power there to do that but basically you know that noise is not part of the equation with LA90 as even 5 watt measurement hits below threshold of hearing.We want to know the power increase though so here it is (with 8 ohm which is the minimum impedance):Now we get good bit of power at 95 watts with almost no penalty relative to non-bridged mode.  Notice the massive gap as far as noise floor relative to Purifi amplifier.Allowing for 1% distortion we get:Here is the super wideband spectrum of the amplifier while producing 5 watts:',\n",
       " ' Hypex NCx500 NCOREx reference design amplifier. It was sent by the company and kindly assembled by our local expert, @Rick Sykora.As you see the sample is a \"monoblock\" configuration (one channel) driven by Hypex SMPS1200 switching power supply.  The only other board is the Ncore standard interface board.   The gain as set is almost 12 dB.  ',\n",
       " ' Hypex Nilai500DIY class D amplifier module with PS500DIY power supply. Parts were provided by the company and member @Rick Sykora was kind enough to assemble it:As indicated, the single channel amplifier is on the left and the power supply on the right. The amplifier has built-in preamp providing three levels of gain (12, 22 and 28 dB). A jumper selects the appropriate level.  At 12 dB, you need about 12 volts to reach full power which requires a pro audio interface or a pre-amp with that level of output.  The sole input in this configuration is balanced.In use the amplifier was exceptionally solid even when pushed hard.  It kept going and stayed very cool.  It is rated to 2 ohm (see measurements below).',\n",
       " \" Benchmark AHB2 Amplifier using THX technology to reduce distortion.  I was going to request one for testing due to membership demand but to my pleasant surprise, the company volunteered to contact me and send not one, but two units!  I requested the second one because of something  I was seeing in the measurements that turned out to be my issue, not the amp's.  The AHB2 retails for US $2,999 from the company direct.The AHB2 is a very compact form factor, enabled by use of switching power supply to increase efficiency/density:There is just a power switch in the front.  It might be but I constantly reached for the screw next to it to power it on!  Having the power switch be slightly different color or shape may help with this.There are a set of LEDs that show the status of the amplifier.  They are driven by an FPGA (field programmable digital logic) that monitors all aspects of the amplifier and shuts down the unit if stressed.  It did so very quickly and efficiently in my testing.  Usually this is done with purely analog or maybe a small microprocessor.  As such, the coverage of scenarios that could damage the amplifier is much less complete than using the approach Benchmark is using in AHB2.Here is the back panel:This is a very minimalistic approach given the small amount of real estate available.  Only input is XLR balanced which is just fine in my book.  A gain switch allows the input level to be controlled so that you can just use an RCA to XLR adapter and still get full power (2 volt max in high gain).  At the other extreme, the low gain setting is designed for professional pre-amps with lots of output, getting its max power at 9.8 volts.  Using this scheme, the signal to noise ratio can be improved as you will see in measurements later.For speaker terminals there are two sets: classic heavy duty banana jacks and SpeakOn.  The SpeakOn are locking and provide the best performance.  I lost about 3 dB of performance using the banana jacks due to less secure connect there.  So the measurements you see are with SpeakOn jacks.Another minor nit on that note: I had a rather cheap SpeakOn cable and its plug was just large enough to hit the silver screws that the sockets are mounted with.  Typical round shaped SpeakOn ones are not an issue.  Flush mount screws would solve this problem.There is a switch for selecting stereo or mono bridged output.  The latter quadruples the amount of power available and unlike typical bridging, according to Benchmark comes at no penalty in distortion!  I plan to test this later as it has a minimum impedance of 6 ohm so I could not use the 4 ohm setup I used for this testing.There is a very beefy AC mains cable with really nice locking tabs.  Insert it and it stays put unless you push the two red tabs on each side.  Nothing is more aggravating than the AC cable coming half-way lose from the IEC socket.Being a proper company of course the AHB2 comes with full set of regulatory/safety/emissions certifications which is super important with power amplifiers given the high voltages and currents running around in them.In use the AHB2 stays very cool for a power amplifier when it is idling, outputting little power which was a nice surprise.As to THX technology, it merges a low-power but very low distortion amplifier with a high power but higher distortion amplifier.  The distortion of the latter is not seen because it is producing so much power (so the ratio of distortion is lower).  The general scheme is not new, dating back to 1980s but new implementation is.  We have seen this in stellar performance of Massdrop THX AAA 789 amplifier which broke new ground in level of distortion and noise. Will the Benchmark AHB2 manage the same?  Let's see.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my 5 watt output test using 4 ohm load using SpeakOn terminals as noted:I hope your jaw is on the floor just like mine was when I saw this picture emerge!    113 dB THD+N in a power amplifier?  Are you kidding me?Look at the harmonic distortion.  The worst case spike is below -130 dB!  This is insanely good.  Of course this type of SINAD (signal and noise ratio) crowns the Benchmark AHB2 as the best I have ever tested:The performance was so good I literally had to rebuild my dummy load to get there.  Even the quality of the metal used in the connectors matters to get to this level of distortion.  I replace all my dummy loads with higher precision ones that have much less VCR (voltage coefficient of resistance).  Resistor values can become voltage dependent creating distortions of their own.  Up to about 105 dB of THD+N, it doesn't matter but beyond that, the VCR was the dominant distortion, not the Benchmark AHB2 amplifier!It was requested that I show the breakdown and distortion so here we are:Our best case hearing threshold is -116 dB SPL so no question that this level of distortion is totally inaudible.  Separating the noise from THD, we see that it is noise that we are measuring as THD+N, rather than distortion:And this is with exceptional noise performance of Benchmark AHB2 as we see in the graph of THD+N versus power:Even in high gain, the AHB2 easily outperforms the DIY Hypex NC400 I had tested before which used to be the best amp I had tested.We have 185 watts of power at incredibly low distortion of 0.00016%, besting the company specifications.Note that the FPGA protection mode kicks in and essentially shots the amplifier down past the limit.  You get absolutely distortion-less and noiseless performance until there is no more.\",\n",
       " \" Audiophonics HPA-S400ET. It was sent to me by the company after member request and costs 1 490,00 € (US $1,638).I must say this is one of the best packaging of class D amplifiers (Purifi in this case) that I have seen!  It is slick and has style.  While the heatsink on one side is cosmetic, the other is connected to the power supply power transistors although in use nothing rose above room temperature.  Back panel shows extremely high quality speaker connections:You can see it better with the lid open:I must say, this is so clean you can eat of of it!    I simply cannot find any fault with the assembly and design.  Bottom to modules are Purifi 1ET400A modules fed by their own custom buffer/pre-amp gain stage.  Jumpers let you select from different settings (see measurement section).Audiophonics HPA-S400ET MeasurementsGiven the three different gain stages, it was a challenge to decide what to test so that this job doesn't become nearly infinite in scope.  I will first show you the dashboard for all three gains starting from high gain:This is superb performance already with distortion products at -125 dB.  Channel matching is excellent.  Here is medium gain petformance:This is a nice setting as max power is achieved at 4 volts meaning you can use all of our modern/desktop amps to drive the unit and gain a bit of performance.If you have a pro interface that goes up to 10 volts out, you can utilize the low gain mode:This gain is actually close to how I measured our two top performers (Benchmark AHB2 and Topping PA5) so let's see how the Audiophonics ranks:Looking at top 20 we see:Amazing performance!  Measuring SNR at low and medium gain we get:OK, from here on I am going to stick with low gain mode.  Here is our multitone:Stellar as expected.  Crosstalk manages to actually land in #1 position of any amplifier tested:Frequency response is dead flat with no load dependency:Let's sweep and see how we do with 4 ohm load:Excellent performance.  Here is how much power we get if we allow more distortion:Switching to 8 ohm we see that the performance actually exceeds than of Purifi (although I think that was tested at higher gain):Testing at other frequencies we still have great performance:Finally, the amplifier is stable at power up so no need to wait for it to warm up:ConclusionsThe Audiophonics HPA-S400ET comes in a beautiful package with super performance to match its good looks. Yes, it builds on Purifi's excellent platform but they managed to add value without messing with its performance.  The gain settings are well thought through.  The whole thing is so well executed and must be a delight to our European members who can buy it locally.  Having been built in France, it is also a feather in the cap of our French members.  I am happy to give my strongest recommendation to Audiophonics HPA-S400ET.  You have a lot of power with superb fidelity and transparency.\",\n",
       " ' TP (Topping) RA3 stereo balanced rackmount amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $229.Yes, this is a new sub-brand from Topping.  I quite like it.  The large and highly visible volume level is as gorgeous to look at as it is responsive.  A remote control is provided which is something you don\\'t usually get.  The remote (or front panel) allow you to select between RCA and XLR input:For those of us who have a DAC and an analog source, this is all that we need.Lots of nice touches are there such as independent memory for the volume setting for RCA vs XLR.  Safe volume settings.  Trigger support and ability to update firmware in the future.  Love that despite low cost, the power supply is built in.  You have a hard power switch which puts the unit in standby.  Push the volume knob or the remote button and it powers on.This line of products, at least for now, will be sold by Topping direct.  Alas, it is not yet on the website so you may have to wait a bit to order it.I don\\'t know anything about the design but based on measurements below, it seems to be a highly optimized class D chip architecture.TP RA3 Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Distortion is kept below threshold of audibility at around -116 dB.  So noise is the only thing we need to worry about.  There, when combined with distortion, nicely lands RA3 in our top 20 best amplifiers ever tested:Mind you, noise performance is excellent:Survey of available music indicates best case dynamic range of 18 bits and TP RA3 gives you that at just 5 watts!  Allow it to go to its max power and it reaches 20 bits.Multitone showcases the very low distortion in mid frequencies where our hearing is most sensitive:But if you insist on pumping ear deafening high frequency tones into it in the form of 19 and 20 kHz tones, you naturally get more distortion:A concern with low cost class D amp ICs is load (speaker) dependency.  Topping has worked hard to make that basically a non-issue:Crosstalk is incredibly good, besting even our reference:Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm:As noted, measurements completely match Topping spec of 130 watts at 1% THD+N.  Not boundless power but very good for many.  Naturally we lose good bit of power if you have a rare 8 ohm speaker:Varying the frequency we do see the class D chip amp create more distortion above 5 kHz or so:There is a bit of a noise spike with power off:There is some inconsequential spikes in one channel in the first short minutes as the amplifier warms up:Speaking of that, the amplifier didn\\'t feel to be rising above room temperature in my testing -- on top anyway.Finally, here is the efficiency vs output power (per channel -- both channels driven):Idle power while on is about 9 watts. The protection circuit is aggressive in the way it shuts the unit down when pushed hard so I did not try to run my reactive load tests.ConclusionsIt is remarkable to me how Topping is not only capable of producing new product one after the other, they do so while striving for state of the art in performance.  This is so even though they are bound by the capabilities of the class D chip amplifier they are using.  I really like the larger form factor as it not only allows better dissipation of heat and inclusion of AC power supply, but also makes the unit more substantial and \"professional looking.\"  If they made the rack ears optional, they would fit nicely in a home system as well.Feature set is great for this class of product with inclusion of remote control, trigger support, nice and visible volume level, etc.It is my pleasure to add TP RA3 to my recommended list.  Incredible performance for so little money. ',\n",
       " \" Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp with the optional Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage.  With that option, the cost is £1,979.00 excluding VAT.  This translates into US $2,554.  The unit was purchased new and drop shipped to me by a kind member.  I had previously measured the reference design from Purifi so will be good to see how this version rates with a different input stage.The Nord dual monoblock comes in a very attractive enclosure (most of which is not visible in this image):Efficiency of class D amplifiers and switchmode power supply enables such slim case to be used.  There are two rows of heatsinks on the sides but they are decorative for the most part.  I will do a teardown separately.  For now, the amplifiers dissipate heat into the bottom of the chassis and dual power supplies have their own heatsinks inside the box.The back panel shows seriously beefy and nice feeling speaker connectors:When I received the unit, it immediately shut down.  The reason was a blown fuse.  I replaced it with a spare that comes in the IEC holder.  That worked for all but my last test which is the strenuous power vs frequency.  I have let Colin know that I think the fuse amperage needs to be increased given our low operating voltage in US.  Note that with music you are not going to hit this easily so it is more of an issue of lab/stress testing.  I don't have a higher amp fuse to try with it until a batch arrives on Monday.  The fuse is the smaller 5x25mm which I only have a few of in low amperage (usually are used in multimeters and such).\",\n",
       " ' Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  With the options as tested, the cost is US $4,212.  As the name indicates, the amp is based on Hypex NC1200 class D amplifiers plus some value add in the form of Sonic Imagery 990Enh buffers, very fancy speaker terminals and even directional fuse from Synergistic Research!The enclosure is the same elegant design I have tested before with Purifi modules:And here is the back panel connectivity:The massive speaker terminals had no trouble handling my heavy speaker wires.The trigger input is unusual in that it is supposed to fully shut of the unit, consuming no power (?).  The amps are mounted to the bottom of the case as is typically down.  So the top got slightly warm in testing.  The bottom though was rather toasty after stress testing.  I will post a teardown later.In use, the NC1200DM never complained, shut down, or go into protection.  Even during my intensive power versus frequency that causes weaker designs to bail out, the NC1200DM cruised right on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard at 5 watts into 4 Ohms:Channel matching is quite good.Highest distortion is third harmonic at around -108 dB which mostly responsible for 105 dB of SINAD (signal relative to sum of distortions and noise).  This puts the NC1200DM near the top of our rankings:Signal to noise ratio was quite good especially near max power:32-tone signal resembling \"music\" shows exceptionally low intermodulation distortion in audible band:Most meaningful test is power versus distortion and noise so let\\'s get into that with 4 ohm load:We clock nearly 500 watts before the clipping onset.  Hypex rates the module at 700 watts which is likely at higher distortion levels (see later).  Distortion rises fairly early relative to our reference.I was surprised to once again see how quiet the NC1200DM was when testing at 8 ohms and comparing to Purifi 1ET400A reference design:Power output leaves 1ET400A behind at 270+ watts.  The cost is higher distortion.Keeping THD+N at 0.1% and sweeping the frequency we get:Now we peak at 600 watts.  Drop at low frequencies where we need power is slight (10% or so).  The sudden drop at 20 kHz is usually due to ultrasonic noise shaping and wide bandwidth of this test (90 kHz).  In real use, we don\\'t need much power at 20 kHz and at any rate, a lot more would be produced than this chart indicates.Here is the intermodulation distortion for 19+20 kHz tones for those of you who love this graph: Remember that the threshold of hearing is quite high at 19 and 20 khz even for people with healthy response up to these levels.  And at any rate, music never has full amplitude signals at these levels.Crosstalk performance was very good, stopping just short of our reference:ConclusionsThe Nord One NC1200M Signature ',\n",
       " \" VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp (buffer/input gain stage).  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,090.  I just reviewed the same amp but with SIL 994EnH-Ticha Pro buffer so you can compare them. As with the other variation, I am a fan of the more slim rack mount case (it is a lot deeper than this photo shows):Back panel as expected:VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp MeasurementsLet's start with our dashboard and see if the power supply noise we had with the SIL buffer also exists here thereby telling us if the problem was that or something else:Sadly the issue remains with the noise in the FFT spectrum.  So something else is at play.  I tried to mess with grounding to see if it impacts it and it would get much worse.  At one point one channel got unstable producing variable output.  Maybe that was instrumentation error but I did not walk away with a good feeling on this.  Nevertheless, overall ranking remains quite high due to stellar performance of Purifi amplifier module itself:I am just going to post the rest of the measurements without text as they are similar as the other review:When I ran the dashboard and saw the same problems with the other VTV amplifier, I wanted to rule out instrumentation error.  So I dug up my Purifi reference design and it produced superbly clean output as it did in my original review.  While I was at it, I also ran this test (which sadly I over-wrote) and it produced similar output to this VTV amplifier.  So the choice of buffer doesn't have much impact here:ConclusionsWhen I bought my latest car, it came with a fine scratch on the instrumentation cluster cover.  Too lazy to take it back to be repaired.  To this day it bothers me when I see it even though it doesn't impact anything on the operation of the car.  Such is the case with this VTV Purifi amplifiers.  In absolute terms they land way on top of the class.  But looking carefully we see that something in the assembly and layout has caused performance to degrade objectively.  It won't impact you in any way listening to it but just like my car, it shouldn't be there.  Smaller companies building these boxes don't do any measurements and hence can't spot problems like this.  So it is partly understandable but as consumers, we get to be ruthless in our demand in best in class execution.  So I hope the company looks to resolve these problems as their prices are very attractive otherwise.I can't recommend the VTV Purifi amplifiers based on these two versions I have tested.\",\n",
       " 'The design of the Vera Audio P150/600 RS is complete. The price is 29 600 NOK exclusive tax and shipping. Due to the corona situation and a delay with chassises, it will be a while before we have a decent number in quantity. We only have a few for sales at the moment and that\\'s the reason it hasn\\'t been announced yet. But I thought I would share some details for those who have an interest.In 4 Ohm it delivers 1kW with amazingly low 0.0006% THD+N. This is bridged, but it says a lot about the performance. The \"notches\" you see in the graph below comes from our measuring equipment switching measuring area and isn\\'t able to keep up with such low numbers. The actual distortion around 50-500W is even lower. Probably down towards 0.00025%.In stereo mode it gives out 290W in 4 Ohm with the same low distortion:The linearity is also in it\\'s own class. +/- 0.025dB from 20Hz to 20kHz. -3dB at 60kHz.The noise as low as 17uV (A-weigthing):CMRR.This is something we have spent a lot of resources on. Briefly said, CMRR is the the amplifiers ability to supress noise that comes from the outside through cables. Everything over 100dB is considered expectionally good.Here\\'s the measurement of the gain adjustments. This is also something we have spent a lot of time on to get accurate.You can see that the maximum deviation is 0.01dBThe chassis of the amplifier is cut out from a whole block of aluminium and there are no visible screws or seams. It\\'s of very high quality and part of the reason our amplifier cost what it does besides extremely accurate gain adjustments, bridging option, etc.Some more info from our enigneer Armand:* We use a huge power supply of 3kW. This has plenty more capacity and runs cooler at heavy loads. It will also result in much lower distortion at low frequencies (at high loads)* Our amplifier is (as far as we know) the only Purifi model that has bridging capability. A lot of testing has been done and special considerations are in place to make this work as it should. Looking at the measurements of 1kW with 0,0006% distortion proves this is flawless.* We deliver real measurements of the whole amplifier from input to output measured with a R&S Audio analyzer. https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/my/product/upv-productstartpage_63493-7558.html.  The noise, THD+N and power delivery presented by others on specification sheets are in several cases only copied from the Purifi 1ET400A datasheet and do not tell the whole story. Internal layout, audio buffer, power supply, cooling capacity all play a role into the final result.* We use a microcontroller that constantly monitors the 1ET400A modules. Temperatures, voltages, overcurrent, clipping, error modes, etc. The RGB LED on the front will warn the user if the amplifier operates outside safe limits. Clipping is warned with RED/GREEN blinks depending on Left/Right channel. Sustained overcurrent will shut down the amplifier in order to avoid damage to speakers and warn the user with steady RED light. A yellow light will warn the user that the temperature is reaching a level that is not healthy.* We have a Auto OFF function. 3 hours without signal on the inputs will initiate a shutdown of the amplifier to conserve power and longevity of the product . (This function can be disabled by the user if not wanted)* There is a trigger input. (This automatically overrides the Auto OFF function)* All small signal levels are contained inside a well shielded small compartment in the back, ensuring low noise and excellent RF protection. The RF protection is done directly at the back of the fully shielded Neutrik XLR inputs. The XLR inputs are directly connected to the chassis to ensure short signal patc to ground.* Remote sensing of the amplifier feedback loop at the speaker terminals using a four wire system ensures the lowest possible output impedance and distortion at the terminals.Here is a picture of the internal layout.

       " ' Neurochrome Modulus-286 Power (speaker) amplifier Kit.  It is on kind loan from company designer and member, @tomchr.  It is to ship by end of this month and costs $1,299.  See: https://www.neurochrome.com/product/modulus-286-kit-2/As you may recall from my review of Tom\\'s headphone amplifier, Neurochrome designs strive for very low distortion and good, objective performance.  So I have been quite excited and anxious to measure one of Tom\\'s power amplifiers.From the outside, the Modulus-286 is rather small but very chunky look with massive heatsinks (for its size) on each side of the unit:The heart of Modulus-286 and other solid state amplifiers Tom designs are the integrated LM3886 IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect this is from the National Semiconductor team though which was acquired by TI.The LM3886 is a pretty powerful little IC capable of producing about 70 watts at 4 ohm.  The Modulus-286 uses a pair of them to get over 100 watts of power at the same rating for each channel.  Typical of mass market amplifier ICs though, the distortion rating is nothing to write home about at 0.02% (SINAD of 71 dB).  In Tom\\'s design, an active feedback loop (i.e. uses an op-amp) brings this distortion way down as you will see in the measurements.The LM3886 is a class AB amplifier unlike other products we have tested that use much more efficient class D.  So while the LM3886 by itself is small, it requires pretty large heatsinks to cool it which is the reason for them being included in Modulus-286.  But in addition to the amplifier circuit, another source of size, weight and some heat is the power supply.  Here, Modulus-286 deviates from classic class AB designs by using a switching power supply to gain its size and weight advantage.  You can see it in the center of the Modulus-286:It is a commercial switching supply which Tom says has been customized for his use.The amplifier modules are actually hard to see on each side of the central power supply.  I tried to take a picture of them but it was hard:You can see the two LM3886 ICs mounted to the heatsink at the bottom.  I am sure there are better pictures at Tom\\'s website.So let\\'s get into the measurements and see how she does.MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my dashboard view with 5 watts of output and in this case, XLR balanced inputs:SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) breaks the 100 dB barrier which is nice.  You can see that the distortion of 0.0009% is orders of magnitude better than the specified level by TI (although that number is likely at higher powers).I noticed a lot more mains/power supply noise in one channel than the other.  Nothing I did would impact its level.  I could also feel the \"tingling\" sensation from the case which indicates mains leakage.  This is legal and safe (allowed in safety standards) but does explain the elevated levels there.  Of course at -110 dB is not audible since our hearing is so poor in low frequencies.Next, I measured the all important power versus distortion+noise:Compared to our best measured so far, Hypex NC400, the Modulus-286 nearly matches it in noise level.  On distortion, one channel also tracks the NC400 until its max power of 95 watts.  This was with 0.975 millivolts of input.  Attempting to feed it strong signal would cause it to go into protection so I could not quite get to the specified power rating.One channel deviates some though as you see in light red.  the better channel goes as low at 0.0007% of THD+N or SINAD of 103.  Seeing how this is at max power, it is very nice figure to arrive at.  Performance is basically noise dominated with no distortion until the shut down.The Hypex DIY NC400 has more power but its distortion starts to rise from where Modulus-286 stops.  It produces 226 watts at the point I have marked in blue.  So it has more headroom.Frequency response shows somewhat early roll off:We are down 0.4 dB at 20 kHz.  Would have been nice to see this flatter seeing how this is a traditional class AB design.  Likely it is part of the computation to keep the amplifier stable with different loads.  Of course not an audible concern for most of us who can\\'t even hear 20 kHz let alone 0.4 dB of drop in there.  Signal to noise ratio is quite good:Broadband spectrum analysis to 1 MHz shows very little of concern:We see some indication of the switching frequency of the power supply around 160 kHz but its level is quite low at nearly -100 dB.  With class D amplifiers we see levels as high as -30 dB!  Note that since this is a class AB amplifier, I did NOT use my AES-17 filter with any of the tests.I tested THD+N versus frequency at 6 different power levels as you see on the graph:As expected, distortion rises at higher frequencies (feedback gain is lowest there).  At 97 watts, the Modulus-286 could produce frequencies above 1 kHz but below that, it would enter into protection mode as indicated by vertical lines in orange.At the lowest power level (0.25 watt) we are dominated by noise and hence the elevated line in red for that.  That is true of any power amplifier.Finally here is the crosstalk for one channel (the other is better):Please take this as worst case response.  I am testing the amp using a bunch of wires everywhere which can impact crosstalk (and noise levels at low amplification).  I need to build a dedicated module with tight wiring for tests like this.  Regardless, numbers like this are amply good enough as far as audibility is concerned.ConclusionsThe Neurochrome delivers good power with very low distortion using a combination of active feedback and off-the-shelf amplifier IC.  Use of a switching power supply keeps costs, size and weight down.  It produces nearly 100 watts of very clean power into 4 ohm load.  Personally I like to have much more power than that.    But if you have subwoofers, or don\\'t listen as loud and/or have more efficient loudspeakers, you should be fine.I am not sure what value judgement to put on the amplifier.  Certainly at $1,300, the Modulus-286 amplifier is \"cheap\" compared to any high-end amplification.  At the other externe, the DIY Hypex NC400 I tested produced more power at I think $1,500.  Purchasing the Neurochrome Modulus-286 would let you support a smart, Canadian designer and entrepreneur.  I let you decide how valuable that is.Overall, I can recommend the Neurochrome Modulus-286 as a well-engineered product with no design faults.',\n",
       " ' NAD M27 7-channel surround audio amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Seems like the M27 came out back in 2014 and costs US $4,400.The M27 has the same design language as the excellent M17 Home Theater Processor (looks only):The enclosure, especially the top surfaces, oozes quality and luxury in the way that many high-end audio companies fail at.  And the looks are actually functional with ample ventilation holes for proper cooling.  I will do a teardown later to show this in more detail.One strange bit of functionality is that the NAD logo lights up orange but goes off when the amplifier is turned on using the touch button on top.  This is backwards but fits the functionality for home theater use in darkened room.The rear panel takes the high quality look of the front and top to the back:Everything from XLR connectors to speaker terminals is stout and feels solid.In use, the amplifier when driven in two channel mode, never came remotely close to complaining, shutting down, etc. which I frequently see in AVRs.Heat dissipation at first is very modest but after half hour of use, the idle power consumption of the rest of the unused channels served to warm up the top.  No worries though as it was not remotely \"hot.\"  This is due to use of switching power supply (single one powering all the channels) and class D amplifiers based on design from Hypex nCore series.  The actual implementation is custom which I will show in teardown.For my testing, I focused on XLR input only.  I hope if you buy an amplifier of this class, that is the connection you use.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard, driving two channels into 4 ohm at 5 watts:Ah, what a relief it is to see excellent SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) in home theater space after testing so many subpar amplifiers in AVRs.  Distortion products are around -110 dB.  Ironically, this is far better than the processor and AVR DACs we have tested.  In 2-channel world, our desktop class are usually way ahead of amplifiers but not in home theater.  So far anyway.The very nice showing in noise and distortion puts the M27 amplifier near top of the class:Spectrum of 1 kHz FFT shows the typical switching frequency in 400+ kHz:Here is the frequency response:There is a kink in there around 50 kHz but seeing how it is way out there as far as audiblity, it should be OK.  May differ though with a real speaker load.Crosstalk is very good:Dynamic range at around rated power is excellent (better than 20 bits in digital terms):Even at rated power you have 105 dB or 17.5 bits.Most important test is THD+N (distortion+noise) relative to power level as we increase input.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Wow, this is one powerful beast in stereo mode.  Courtesy of a power supply that is designed to feed 7 channels, it is not a bottleneck in 2-channel mode allowing these class d modules to sing.  And sing loud!8 Ohm output is also quite good:Of course in neither case we are able to match the state-of-the-art 2-channel amplifiers from likes of Benchmark or Purifi.  But what is there at -90 dB or better should be quite excellent.Peak power as you can imagine, is even higher:Here is a refined version of a recent test: I sweep for power using different frequencies from 20 kHz on down to just 20 Hz.  Test bandwidth is 45 kHz so that it allows enough harmonics to be included in the test but not too much that it just shows ultrasonic noise-shaping and such:As expected, at low frequencies we have lowest distortion (lowest graphs) but we clip due to much larger power demand of these \"slow\" waves.ConclusionsThe NAD M27 surround power amplifier has exceptional looks and build quality.  It is beautiful to look at.  That beauty runs way deep into its veins, producing lots of power in a class-leading way.  Efficiency of class-d power amplifier and switching power supplies serve to keep the unit quite cool for its power rating and number of channels.  Great attention has gone into heat management and signal flow -- something I don\\'t normally see in DIY hypex ncore builds.Yes, at US $4,400 it is not cheap but you are getting 7 channels of amplifications.  That is roughly $630/channel which is actually quite competitive.I am happy to give the NAD M27 one of my highest recommendations.If you have a home theater and want a gorgeous, powerful and performant multi-channel amplifier, your search is over.  Get the M27 and worry about money for food later.',\n",
       " \"This is a write-up and detailed measurements of the March Audio P122 class D Hypex based stereo power amplifier.  It was sent to me by the company (@March Audio).  The P122 costs US $750. Due to my relationship with company owner, I won't be performing a review or providing a recommendation one way or the other.  So don't look for panthers on pictures either.The P122 uses similar packaging to the rest of March Audio products:There is just a touch button that turns the unit on and off (really on and standby).The back panel has very nice and really long speaker terminals:In use, the P122 never complained or get warm.  It passed all the tests without going into protection mode.Power supply is switching as noted on the unit so works as is worldwide.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:As noted on the THD+N panel, performance is roughly the same as the spec in one channel and slightly better in the other.  Distortion and noise combined is near top of class:Signal to noise ratio is excellent:Crosstalk is respectable as well:Frequency response is good but not flat out to infinity as some amps are:Multitone test shows a few odd spikes in mid frequencies:But levels are nearly 100 dB down so not a cause for concern.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet's start with 4 ohm:We are a bit shy of the specification on power but distortion and noise is much better than typical mass market product.  Same is true of 8 ohm load:Not sure what explains the shortfall in power. These amplifiers have regulated switching power supplies so usually don't produce more power than continuous:ConclusionsWhile the power level is on the low side, the performance is much better than typical brand name amplifiers.\",\n",
       " ' ATI AT522NC Stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 522NC costs US $2,195 but I see it on Amazon for US $1,995.  The AT522NC is part of a series which starts with 2 channels of class D amplification and goes up to 4 channels in the same enclosure.The industrial design of the AT522NC has some unique touches, some of which work, some that don\\'t:The part that detracts is ironically the ATI logo.The power button has a very nice feel and gives one impression of quality.Looking at the back, I was surprised by choice of input power connection:It is a 20 amp IEC connection rather than the most common, 15 amp variety.  This is partially due to use of linear power supply and massive/heavy toroidal transformer.  But the most common reason is that the same setup is used in higher channel count amplification.The amplifier is on a vertically mounted hypex NC-500 class D amplifiers with their own heatsinks.  The \"motherboard\" has the power supply components.  Overall, it seems like a very neat and logical design.The speaker connections are of course very secure and high quality as can be expected in this price range.  Great to see balanced XLR inputs which is how I tested the unit.In use, there was barely a heat rise in the enclosure and the unit never shut down or complain even in the face of severe clipping.   The large feet allow better convection cooling which is appreciated.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone, at 5 watt into a 4 ohm load:The use of linear power supply has its price in the form of power supply spurious tones (60, 18, 300 Hz, etc.).  The dominant distortion peak is third harmonic at a bit less than 100 dB.  Add some noise to it and SINAD (THD+N inverted) becomes around 98 dB.  This places the ATI522NC well above average of all the amplifiers we have tested:It sits just to the level of NC500 from Nord.  Those of you who keep track of such things , I am sure will compare and contrast how it does relative to other Hypex based implementations.Signal to noise ratio is good reaching excellence at full power:Frequency response is orderly for a class D amplifier which needs an output filter to truncate switching frequency:32-tone source trying to simulate \"music\" shows very low levels of intermodulation distortion:But for a peak at 60 Hz (typo in the graph), the distortion-free range is 110 dB or about 18 bits.Crosstalk is also very good:Most important data is power into 4 and 8 ohm versus distortion and noise.  So let\\'s start with 4 ohm:So not class leading but low distortion while providing 300 or so watts before sudden rise in distortion.  Spec is higher but one can have more data points at the limit and gradually walk up the curve, and hence squeeze out a few more watts.  I will show this later.For 4 ohm load, here is the comparison to our state-of-the-art in class D amplification in the form of Purifi reference design:Purifi maintains the lead in distortion but produces a bit less power.I was able to run my tough test of THD+N at 0.1% versus frequencies.  Some amplifiers have died trying to run this test.  Others are had to poinpoint as their distortion jumps all over the place:We see that at 1 kHz we normally measure, power is almost near max.  Above that we reach nearly 360 watts.  At 20 kHz though, distortion shoots way up and we are able to only produce 22 watts before THD+N of 0.1% is hit.  Fortunately there is not much music energy there so practical audible concern is low.I made a survey of a few of the tracks in my music library.  Peak energy seems to hover around 40 Hz.  For that reason, I have started to measure amount of power at 40 Hz and here, we have 316 watts which is good.Finishing off, switching frequency is around 400 kHz:The noise doesn\\'t scale with power though.  Plotting the same at max power with source frequency of 40 Hz gives us this:And intermodulation distortion using 19+20 kHz at 5 watts output into 4 ohm:ConclusionsThe ATI AT522NC seems like a solidly built amplifier based on Hypex NC500 modules.  ATI builds amplifiers for many other companies and this competence shows up in this review.  Performance is of course limited by what the NC500 module can do.  Use of linear power supply defeats the size and weight advantages of common class D amplifiers.  It may provide better peak power rating -- something I wanted to test but forgot.  Overall, I can recommend the ATI AT522NC stereo amplifier.',\n",

The M28 costs US $4999 through its dealers.As with the M27 amplifier I reviewed, the M28 comes in the same gorgeous industrial design:At nearly 50 pounds, this is a heavy amplifier likely due to the weight of the enclosure as the class D amplifiers and it switching power supply are light.The one thing I am not a fan of is the touch on/off button on top.  It is not responsive.  I wish the NAD logo was a hard switch.The back panel shows how you do a first class job of termination:I have kind permission from the owner for a teardown so look for that soon.',\n",
       " ' Buckeye Hypex NC502MP 8-channel class D amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $2,295.There is not a whole lot to look at here.  Sheet metal is rather thin and fitment not that great.  So put it in a cabinet and forget about it.  The backside shows the expected including trigger control to sequence powering up multiple units with one stroke:I was surprised by the weight of the amplifier. Mind you, it is far lighter than a class AB amplifier but it is still not light.  The reason for that is that each amplifier module has a large vertical heatsink with quite stout mounting bracket tying it to the chassis.If you are not familiar with Hypex NC502MP, it is an all-in-one high power stereo amplifier with on-board switching power supply and input buffer.  Supply the connectors and you have a complete amplifier.  In this case, four such modules are included to get to 8 channel.  Due to large amount of power these amplifiers can produce in tandem, dual AC inputs are provided.  The amplifiers are split between the two AC inputs.  If you don\\'t need continuous power, you can connect both inputs to the same power strip which is how I tested it.Buckeye Hypex NC502MP Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard by measuring one amplifier module\\'s dual outputs:Performance is very good as we expect from Hypex modules.  A minor issue was the power supply spikes in one channel (blue). I tested all the amplifier modules and they all do the same thing.  So likely is due to leakage from the onboard power supply bleeding into the more adjacent channel on NC502MP.  Using the \"good\" channel on each board removes that bit of bleeding:Using the former SINAD for ranking, the amplifier nicely lands in our \"excellent\" bucket:Here is all of them in that category:Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and changing the load has no impact on output:Multitone shows the superb performance, albeit somewhat worsened by the less good channel:Noise performance is extremely good:My target is 96 dB at 5 watts which the Buckeye nicely exceeds.  And provides full transparency up to reference level of 120 dBSPL.Crosstalk naturally is beyond approach if you use two separate modules but even in the same module, it is excellent:Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm using channels in the same module or two separate ones:As you see, there is no difference.  You are only limited by how much AC power you have as power supplies are not shared.Max and peak power is impressive:We are talking nearly 1.3 Kilowatts in stereo!  Needless to say, if you are going to have all 8 channels whaling, you better have good amount of current on dual AC lines.  And make an appointment at your ear, nose and throat doctor because hearing damage is most likely!Measuring response at 8 ohm gave me a really hard time:Reason being that online specs from Hypex does not show that hump from 10 to 100 watts at all.  I tried everything from testing my instrumentation to measuring every amplifier module and still got the same results.  I shared the graph with Buckeye only to be told there is updated measurements from Hypex showing the same hump.    While performance is superb up to about 8 watts, I wish that the hump wasn\\'t so pronounced.I was most impressed by the ability of these modules to drive down to 2 ohms with both capacitive and inductive loads:It produces the same 53 volts no matter what!  At 1 ohm though, it instantly went into protection but recovered very quickly.This is one powerful and robust amplifier!Finally, you don\\'t really need to warm it up:FYI, I left the unit on overnight and in the morning, the top was warm especially in the center.  All the amps combined, do generate some amount of heat so best to not leave it on if you don\\'t need it and provide good ventilation.ConclusionsThe Buckeye NC502MP is a perfect amplifier for home theater duty. It provides incredible amount of power from each module to drive even the most inefficient speakers to ear piercing levels.  It does so with extremely low noise and excellent distortion at modest levels.  At higher powers, distortion does climb.  While I wish this was lower, I don\\'t think there is an issue at all for home theater applications.  Even with music, I think you will be fine but the purist may want to have better.  Then again, if you are going to lose power to get there, this amplifier may be a better choice.I am going to put the Buckeye NC502MP 8-channel amplifier on my recommended list.',\n",
       " \" Buckeye Hypex NC502MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased and drop shipped to me by our dear moderator, @AdamG247.  I don't know what it costs.Not sure what there is to say about the case:Or the back panel:Other than the fact that it has trigger switch and that the XLR connectors are upside down.  You need to use two hands to unlock and then pull out the cable.  And heaven help you if you don't know there is a locking tab underneath and you keep trying to yank out the cable anyway! In use, the amplifier is very robust, going into and out of protection with no shut downs (when overdriven).  Note however that once it starts to clip, there is a high pitch whine from the power supply inductors.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started my testing with the amplifier module all the way to the left in the picture above (opposite of AC input).  Here is our warm up graph:Was glad to see the unit stabilize in a couple of minutes so I did not have to wait forever.  Once there, here is our dashboard:I don't know what is going on with the channel in blue producing a lot more power supply noise (relatively speaking).  Grounding made no difference.  As a result, one channel is 3 dB better than the other.  Averaging the two still lands the amp into our upper tier of all amplifiers tested to date:Despite the power supply issue above, signal to noise ratio is excellent and superb if driven to max power:Frequency response shows no sign of load dependency which can be common in class D amplifiers:Multitone test gets polluted by the aforementioned power supply interference:Crosstalk was not as good as I expected although in grand scheme of things, it is not bad:Let's see how much power this thing can pump out starting with 4 ohm load:We have more distortion than I like but that comes with a ton more power than our more accurate but less powerful amplifiers.  Allow 1% distortion and we get even more:Very impressive considering that you have 6 channels in this lightweight enclosure!As noted, power did not increase when I split the measurement between two independent modules at each end of the case. This indicates we are amplifier limited, not power supply (each module has its own power supply).Switch to 8 ohm we get better noise and distortion although the main issue is still there:Multichannel PerformanceI thought I was all set for measuring more than 2 channels only to find out the balanced cables I had bought had the wrong gender.    So all I could do was drive 3 channels at once:What you see is the same stereo pair measured with and without the extra channel also being driven (not shown in the graph).  There is no impact at all which makes sense as these are independent modules and nothing but the power cord is shared between them.Looking for consistency between the modules, I measured each one separately:ConclusionsWhile still way ahead of countless amplifier designs, the Hypex NC502MP modules are built more for power than ultra low distortion.  Not a bad compromise considering the fact that running out of power is quite audible and rise in distortion probably not.  Beauty of class D amplification is showcased by Buckeye in producing six times 600 watts of amplification in a light, and compact case.  I will do a teardown later but so far, I am happy with what is there, sans the upside down XLR connectors.\",\n",

I believe the heart of the unit is Hypex NC122MP.boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2 MeasurementsThe unit stabilized quickly with its performance hardly changing (I optimized the cabling after this measurement so don\\'t worry about channel difference):Here is our dashboard:This level of distortion and noise (SINAD) nicely landed the amp into our \"excellent\" category:Signal to noise ratio was excellent, achieving better than CD dynamic range at just 5 watts of output:Typical of Hypex amplifiers (in a good way) is lack of load impedance dependency which plagues many budget class D amplifiers:The 2408/N2 achieved one of the lowest crosstalk I have measured:Multitone results are very good as well:Let\\'s see how much power we have:Not a ton but it is above average as far as noise and distortion.  Allowing a bit more distortion we get:Which is right on the money as far as company specifications.  Here is 8 ohm performance:Checking for frequency dependence we see well behaved response:But note the loss of power with 20 Hz input.Finally, here is the switching and ultrasonic performance:I checked the unit for temperature after all the test and could barely feel any rise above room temp on any of the surfaces.ConclusionsThe Arthur 2408 comes in an attractive and differentiated package with very high quality connectivity.  Measured performance is hugely above average although not state of the art.  I could not find any weakness in its performance no matter which way I measured it -- a sign of excellent engineering.

You can read more about it here: https://www.jlelectronicsph.com/product/sylph-d200-tpa3255-pffb-stereo-ready-to-run-amplifier-module.  Or ask questions from the company representative @jlesterp.Testing bare modules is difficult for me so I asked for a finished system and that is what I received:Not much to see here so let\\'s look at the module inside:I must say that row of inductors looks pretty lined up that way.    I should note that the company is an ODM (white label designer) for other companies and is located in Philippines.  They provided their own measurements that correlate well with mine.There are two power supply configurations.  The version I have is the lower voltage one (36 volt?) that produces lower power than than if you choose to power it with 45 volt rails.JLE Sylph-D200 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:The gain is rather low compared to 29 dB that I usually see in amplifiers.  Then again this allows full power at the levels that our desktop DACs produce so it is fine.  I understand the base gain in the TI chip is lower still.  A buffer opamp is used to get up to 14 dB.  The lower gain gives an advantage to this board when it comes to other amplifiers which have more noise due to higher gain.  Still, let\\'s do our usual SINAD comparison:The board is just 0.1 dB short of falling in our superb category in blue!  I am told that there is a bit of SINAD loss at the speaker terminals as opposed to the board itself. If so, this is a remarkable achievement.Noise performance is excellent but again, keep in mind the lower gain:At 5 watts, it easily clears my 16-bit/96 dB hurdle.  This shows that we can build more optimized systems if we take full advantage of the output of our DACs with amplifiers that have lower gain.  The board can be configured with the feedback including the output filter or not.  The configuration I have has it including the filter which reduces load dependency but does not eliminate it:Multitone test shows the classic rise of distortion with frequency:Crosstalk performance was very good:Power sweep into 4 ohm load shows very low and interestingly, constant distortion ratio until hard clipping:Company thinks the input buffer is overloading.  As noted, to get more power you need to step up to higher voltage power supply.The hard clipping made it hard for AP software to properly determine the 1%THD point but did show the burst power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Testing for frequency sensitivity we see that behavior is decent:ConclusionsIt is amazing to see the progress these \"chip amps\" are making in the hands of capable designers.  They are inching their way to the top of the class in our distortion and noise rankings while keeping costs very low.  In the case of JLE, it is nice to see a design from another part of the world making it easier to access DIY oriented hobbyists to access them who are locally situated.

The bottom was a bit more warm but nothing remotely of any concern.  There were no shutdowns.  However, I did not try to stress load it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt into 4 ohm test.  I chose the XLR input and low (XLR) gain for all of these tests:The SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) of 94 dB places the OMI Ncore Pro in the upper tier of amplifiers/AVRs tested:Which was a relief after testing a number of home theater amplifiers that stacked on the right of the graph.Frequency response is dead flat but not super wide:Signal to noise ratio at max power output before clipping into 4 ohm was quite respectable:Here is the intermodulation distortion at very high frequencies (19 and 20 Khz tones):You have well over 16 bits of distortion free at modest listening levels.  Keep in mind that your music never has such high amplitudes at these frequencies.  So in practice, the distortion will vanish into noise.Crosstalk performance was excellent:The meat of any amplifier review is power versus distortion and noise.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Shame to see the early rise in distortion starting at 20 watts.  That aside, you have considerable amount of power clocking at 236 watts, both channels driven in this tiny enclosure.Switching to 8 ohm load we get:Now the early rise in distortion is more modest.  We get 125 watts of power at a SINAD of 91 db.  Interesting to compare it to Purifi 1E400A which produces similar power but a whopping 130 dB SINAD or 40 dB better!Peak power is sadly not much more than steady state due likely to regulated power supplies:Good thing the baseline level of power is quite good.ConclusionsThe IOM NCore Pro amp is a solid performer courtesy of competent hypex NC252MP class D amplifier modules.  The packaging is nice and tidy and the price seems reasonable to me.No, you are not getting state of the art performance.  That is in another category altogether.  But that level of performance will cost you more money and comes in a larger package.Overall I am happy to recommend the IOM NCore Pro amplifier. ',\n",
       " \" Buckeye Hypex NC252MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It costs US $1149 as of this writing.  The owner/builder is @Buckeye Amps on our forum.The looks are fine for a well-priced build:The unit is quite light courtesy of rather thin sheet metal.  I am not as worried about the top being thin but the bottom is as well and that is where heat is generated.  You won't likely push all three modules to max but if you did, I would put taller feet under it and maybe even some temperature controlled fans.  In my testing the bottom just got a bit warm so not a major concern.Back panel shows standard connectors plus the trigger input:I stopped using my Mogami Gold XLR cables because I wanted to have colored ones.  I bought a batch from Amazon that is nice and flexible cabling but some kind of generic XLR connectors.  I have found them to be a hair worse than my Mogami cables as far as fit.  On the Buckeye amp though, I could barely get them into the XLR connectors and then back out.  I tried other XLR cables and my other generic ones were also stiff.  The Mogami cable however, was a bit tight but nothing as bad as my generic ones.  I know tolerances very but I had not seen this level of compatibility before with any other gear I have tested.  Anyway, it is a one-shot deal so not a big deal even if the problem exists.Buckeye NC252MP MeasurementsInternally we have three stereo amplifier modules.  So I decided to drive the unit in stereo using first and last channels.  This way we have some variation in modules and their placements.  Here are the results:Hypex spec is 0.002% which we are meeting here.  I could not figure out why the one channel had so much more mains noise (blue).  I tried every kind of grounding but it made no difference at all.  SINAD though is dominated by the second harmonic so that noise is not so material in that regard:So quite competent and better than any mass market AVR amplifier.Frequency response is pretty good for a class D amplifier:Signal to noise ratio is excellent even with that extra mains hum.  It nicely clears the noise floor of a 16-bit digital format:Crosstalk naturally was superb when measuring two different modules but also good in stereo mode in one module:Fascinating that a DIY amplifier can be so good whereas many premium audio products we test struggle here.Let's get into the meat of the review which is the power into 4 ohm load:The red pair of lines is using the two channels out of one amplifier module.  We see healthy amount of power to the tune of 224 watts each. Strangely when I tried two different modules (first and last as before), performance dropped some in both channels even though one channel is the same as before!  Maybe the two amps are fighting each other a bit for current.  Or there is some kind of beat frequency between them.  Not a real worry though as far as audibility but interesting nonetheless.Typical of these class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, there is no peak power:Here is our output with 8 ohm load:Testing for frequency dependency, we get good results as we expect from Hypex modules:ConclusionsI don't know the module price for the amps within this unit but getting 6 channels of amplification with such performance is a heck of a deal.  You are benefitting from a DIY person building these for you with no intention of making a living.    I will do a teardown soon and we can see if the internal build is good. I am happy to recommend the Buckeye 6 channel, NC252MP based amplifier.-----As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/\",\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of Accuphase E-270 Integrated Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from our friends at Gig Harbor Audio.  It is their demo unit so I have to return it on Tuesday.  So if you need something else to be measured, ask right away!  The E-270 was released in 2017 I think and retails for USD $5,000.  This is not cheap by our normal standards but in high-end audio, this is a pretty reasonable price.The industrial design of the unit seemingly has not changed from 1980s era with beautiful VU meters (with acceleration):At 44 pounds, the unit is quite heavy for its capabilities.  There is a massive transformer in the middle of the unit and the power amplifier modules with beefy heatsinks sit on either side.  During my testing, I could not even get the unit to become warm let alone hot!  It runs so comfortably that one thinks it is never going to stress out.The front has a slick finish that is lovely to touch.  Volume control is implemented through resistor ladders and hence has electronic control.  Accuphase says it has 6,500 steps which should be plenty for listening although was a bit difficult to dial in the exact value for measurements.There are slots in the back for optional DAC and phono stage (?) which mine did not have. All in all this is the type of construction, look and feel that would justify paying good bit of premium over a budget product. Given the likely reliability that comes from a high-end product from Japan, I say the stage is set for a good impression.Note: seeing how this is a demo unit to be sold, I did NOT attempt to stress the unit.  No long term warm up and certainly no stress test.  Given the overdesigned thermal design here though, I am not worried about the measurements holding under thermal stress.MeasurementsFor reasons that will become clear later, I decided to test the power amplifier section first.  Accuphase makes this dead easy with a front-panel button \"MAIN IN\" that decouples the power amp input from pre-amp output.  This allowed me to test the power amplifier separately and compare its performance to recently tested power amps.  So let\\'s start with our 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:I have added two more panels here: gain and dc output.  Have not verified the latter but should be correct.  As we see there is a 0.4 dB gain error and variation in distortion level.  The loads I use are not precision types (none are at these high power levels) so some of this may be instrumentation.  I did match levels (not shown) and distortion levels and differentials remained the same. At 92 to 95 dB SINAD, we are getting in territory of transparency for CD music.  The two distortion products are second and third harmonic at around -100 dB.Signal to Noise ratio is very good at 116 dB+:The E-270 is rated at 120 watts and it blows way past that to the tune of 155 watts prior to clipping (green pair):You can see the comparison to recently reviewed Onkyo M-282.  The E-270 outperforms it in every category from lower noise floor and distortion to more power prior to clipping.  The Onkyo of course is a budget product at $300. On not so good news, the Hypex based NC400 amplifier way outshines the Accuphase E-270.  It has far less noise, distortion and much more power. Whoever thinks class AB amplifiers are better than switching ones like NC400, this is the time to cry!  Pre-amplifierLet\\'s isolate the pre-amplifier and measure it at unity gain (same level output that is input):Wow, that is quite a bit better than the power amplifier with much lower noise floor and distortion.  Don\\'t get too excited though.  There are some really odd things going on here.  Let\\'s switch inputs to XLR:What the heck??? We lost 10 dB of performance.What is really, really strange is that if I measure RCA but leave the XLR cables connected, performance drops way down just the same!   You can see it easily in signal to noise ratio measurements:Accuphase hints at much lower performance of XLR input in the specs for the product:This aside, note as I have shown on the FFT chart above how we have lots and lots of power supply related spikes.  This is evident in an FFT of the spectrum (power amp only):Switching power supplies like used in Hypex NC400 amplifier shown in the inset in blue convert mains to DC and then convert it back to AC at hundreds much higher frequency (above audible frequencies).  As a result, you are free of mains related noise in good implementations.    There is no denying how clean the Hypex NC400 amplifier is in the audible band.  The Accuphase E-270 in contrast while cleaner than budget Onkyo M-282, has a ton of noise spikes.The problematic area for switching amplifiers is in the high frequencies so let\\'s look at that:The levels of noise and spurious tones is of course quite a bit lower than switching amplifiers.  We once again see that XLR input has worse performance (see zoomed inset).Let\\'s now re-measure the power versus distortion using the E-270\\'s pre-amp:We have a repeat of issues with XLR input again.  Notice the performance of RCA input with (red) and without XLR (blue) cable connected but not used.  And of course we leave fair amount of performance on the table with respect to the power amplifier alone. It seems that loading the pre-amp with the power amp reduces its performance substantially.  I traced this to pre-amp getting severely distorted when the power amp is under stress.  There is lack of isolation/independent power supply for the pre-amp.Story is the same with intermodulation distortion versus level:Interestingly enough the level sensitivity for XLR is the same as RCA.  I should be able to swing that to 4 volts for the same output with RCA at 2 volts.Frequency response falls in the category of very good news:I left the levels different for each input so that the graphs don\\'t fall on top of each other.  The power amplifier (blue) has the flattest response but by just a bit.  There is really no issue in the audible band to 20 kHz.ConclusionsOn fit and finish, the Accuphase E-270 integrated Amplifier delivers for a product in low thousands of dollars.  It has the nostalgic look of 1980s product which is popular now and certainly different than common mass market products.  Its power amplifier has respectable and conservative specifications.  Measurements show it to produce far more power than stated with massive thermal capacity which should spell long service life.Unfortunately I think there are some serious engineering issues in the pre-amplifier.  The XLR input not only generates much worse performance on its own, but also serves to pollute the performance of RCA input!  There is not sufficient power/isolation for the pre-amp causing its performance to sag when the unit is asked to produce a lot of power.  These are faults that I don\\'t tolerate in mass market products, let alone higher end ones.I would say if you want to get an Accuphase product, get a power amplifier.  The integrated unit as tested just doesn\\'t do that job so sadly, I cannot recommend it.',\n",
       " 'This is a review and measurements of the Schiit Aegir stereo Power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member who has been patiently waiting since August for its review!  The Aegir is sold direct by Schiit and costs US $799 plus shipping.The Aegir is very heavy, substantial and serious looking piece of audio gear in black:What I don\\'t like is the extra sharp edges of the heatsinks on each side where you naturally want to grab it.  But I understand extruded aluminum comes this way and having the corners marchined would be expensive.Here is the back panel:At first I was super excited to see the XLR input but became puzzled why a stereo amp only has one of them.  Then I realized that it is only for driving the unit in bridged mode.  So for most of my testing I used RCA and then used XLR for bridged power testing.I can\\'t quite tell what type of amplifier this is from technical terms Schiit uses.  They seem to want to say this is mostly a class A amplifier but then it isn\\'t at higher power?  Anyway, the Aegir runs warm but not too hot so whatever trick they are using to lower power consumption of this unit versus pure class A is working.The Aegir is a new design which was introduced in 2018.  I see Audio Precision measurements for it which means it is part of the new design philosophy to take measurements and design verification seriously.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard feeding a 1 kHz tone into the amp, aiming for 5 watt output into 4 ohm:Starting on the left side, the gain of 20 dB is on the low side.  Then again the output power is so low (see later) that you don\\'t need a lot of gain to get to maximum power.SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) which is a positive dB version of THD+N mathematically (here anyway), puts the Aegir in respectable, above average ranking of all power amplifiers tested:We see good bit of power supply spikes which I verified to also exist in Schiit AP measurements.  Levels are below -100 dB so likely not audible due to our poor sensitivity in low frequencies.Frequency response is ruler flat in audible band:Signal to noise ratio is good, matching what we need for 16 bit audio playback:Multitone test tells us intermodulation between 32 tones fed to the amplifier:Once again, we see that we clear the 16 bit threshold of CD music.Most important test is power versus THD+N.  Let\\'s see that for 8 ohm:Schiit rates this amp at 20 watts into 4 ohm so we are close.  Likely they allow 1% distortion versus my standard of onset of clipping.What is puzzling is 4 ohm output:We are long ways away from 40 watts.  Then again, the clipping tilts to the right some so I suppose if you walked up that curve far enough, you get to 40 watts.  You would get good bit of distortion though so 40 watts is a marketing number.Note that one channel is more unhappy than the other.  I confirmed that exists just as well in Schiit measurements.  So likely power is fed is less efficiently to one amp than the other.  Or there are grounding, component mismatch, etc..To test bridged mode, I fed the Aegir vial XLR balanced connection and got this:I only get 23 watts of usable power which is hardly more than 19.5 watts I got in stereo mode.  The curve tilts to the right more now so marketing department went to town there to spec the \"80 watt number.\"  Measuring dynamic power which uses 1% number Schiit uses, we do get much more power:So with real music, you likely have more power than my continuous tone tests indicate.Let\\'s test how sensitive the Aegir is to input frequency:Sort of a classic output in that lower frequencies limit the amount of power available (clips earlier) but also have lower distortion.  I was asked to add multitone test to my amplifier measurements.  I usually use that for DACs since there, it is a lossless signal.  To use it for amplifiers, the signal has to be converted from PCM to analog which invokes the DAC in the AP.  That would put a limit on how good of a measurement I can make.  For amps like Aegir is not a limitation though so here it is:We see the general distortion floor is around -100 bits or 17 bits.  However, there are some earlier spikes due to power supply noise.  Again, our hearing is not very sensitive in that region so they can be ignored.ConclusionsThe Schiit Aegir is a competently designed amplifier with solid build quality and no design mistakes.  It shows the power of proper measurements and engineering verification to remove the element of surprise in third-party verification job we perform here.The main issue here is lack of power.  To someone like me, with very large spaces, rather inefficient speakers and desire for bass that you feel as much as you here, the Aegir is definitely not for me.  Nor do I buy into \"Class A\" having any benefit.  If it had, it would show up in measurements.  It does not.If have efficient speakers and/or don\\'t listen very loud, the Aegir is a solid offering from a western company.  I am going to put the Schiit Aegir on my recommended list for its solid engineering and design.  Fitness for application is up to you!  ',\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of a refurbished and upgraded NAD 2200 stereo amplifier. It was bought by a member, sent to QuirkAudio to be fully updated and then loaned to me. The work that Peter has done is exemplary.  The inside looks brand new! I have repaired hundreds of amplifiers but never seen one this clean!  So not only have the inside components been updated/replaced, but a lot of care has gone to cosmetically clean the unit. Peter sent me a long list of parts he has upgraded including reservoir capacitors and such. As a result, I don\\'t know how representative of measurements are of stock units although probably not too far off. Used 2200 go for about US $530 on ebay.The front panel is nice with an informative clipping indicator:As you see, you can put the amp in bridge mode (which I did not test) and select whether you want soft clipping on.  I left it off as you see in the picture.During use the protection circuit came on when appropriate and nicely reset as if nothing had happened.The NAD 2200 uses a dual voltage rail to keep power consumption and heat dissipation low when producing lower power and then upping the voltage for peak power.  This is a common technique but usually applied to low baseline power level.  Here, 100+ watts of power is provided using the low voltage power supply rail and it is only for power above that where the higher voltage is used.  Technique worked quite well as you see later and kept the amplifier cool and happy during my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Not bad!  Distortion is at or below -100 dB.  With noise, SINAD degrades to about 93 dB putting the 2200 well above average of nearly 100 amplifiers tested to date:Notice that the gain is quite high at 32 dB.  Common range is 25 to 29 dB with the latter being a \"THX\" standard.  The higher gain increases noise so despite that, performance is as good as seen.  High gain makes it a good fit for AVRs for example that produce distorted output well below nominal 2 volts.Frequency response has a sharp roll off which seems to indicate the output is not direct coupled (DC) as is common today:Or maybe it is on purpose, I don\\'t know.Crosstalk is very good:As is dynamic range:It is power measurements where the magic of this amplifier comes to life so let\\'s look at that with 4 ohm load first:We can see a kink in distortion when we hit 200 watts as the unit sails past that to produce whopping 337 watts per channel, both driven!  Per design characteristics, you can have much more during momentary peaks:Wow, we have one kilowatt of power coming out of this amp in short duration!Switching to 8 ohm we see similar results as 4 ohm:Sweeping the power test at 4 ohm with different frequencies shows a well-behaved amplifier:You do loose power in higher frequencies but that is fine since music spectrum has lower energy there anyway.Due to the long duration of this test, the protection circuit likely backed off the high voltage rail, producing lower output levels.',\n",
       " ' Devialet Expert 200 Amplifier, DAC, Phono premaplifier and wired streamer.  It seems to be a generation behind the current products offered by Devialet.  The Expert 200 cost US $9,650. The Devialet line of amplifiers made quite a buzz when originally announced given its unique, lifestyle packaging which has not changed yet:A combination of class A amplifier and class D current source is used to keep the size down, and efficiency up. Innovative for its time was inclusion of an SD card and online configurator to change the operation of the unit including re-purposing the back RCA connectors:The thin package creates real compromises here with the exclusion of balanced analog inputs or preamp outputs. Usability suffers quite a bit as well with the display being on top of the unit which simply is not visible from afar.  There is provision for wall-mounting but come on, no audiophile is going to do that and then dangle the cables from it.There is a very substantial remote but strangely has no display on it.  That would consume a lot more power, likely requiring a charger and such.Trying to troubleshoot a problem let me to going to their configurator site and downloading SD images some 10 times.  I have to tell you, it gets old taking the SD card out of the unit, plugging it into a PC, making a simple change, put it back in the unit, wait for a restart, to see the effect.  Granted, you only do this once in a while but during experimentation is quite tedious.  In this day and age, such configurator should be inside the unit and activated vi an app or with a browser.  The data on the SD card is very small anyway (some kind of simple text file).  So it is not like it is data intensive.Overall, I think looks are put way ahead of function on Davialet amplifiers. I had planned to do a much more extensive review of this unit but sadly, right after my first power sweep, it shut down and no longer powers back on.    The online brochure talks extensive about protection measures.  Clearly they are not enough as I suspect the microprocessor board has failed as opposed to the amplifier that has health monitoring.  I am hoping Devialet is responsive to this review and failure and make good on repairing this unit.  I have never had an amplifier fail in such a simple sweep that keeps the power max for just a few seconds.Anyway, I had accumulated enough data that I thought it is worthwhile to post it while waiting for a response from Devialet.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsThe Devialet amplifiers digitize their analog inputs so I thought I start with our dashboard of 5 watts driving using USB input:Distortion products are quite low at < -110 dB.  However, the noise floor is high in low frequencies causing our SINAD to suffer a lot, ending with a metric of 92 dB.  This is well above average compared to all the amplifiers we have measured but way short of state-of-the-art:Analog input creates a lot of harmonic distortion and with it, drags down SINAD a few notches still:I don\\'t understand how their ADC could distort so much in a product this expensive.  It can\\'t even clear 15 bits of distortion-free range.There are some lofty numbers like -130 dB noise floor is thrown around by Devialet.  I am not sure how that is computed.  Using analog Line-in for consistency with other amplifier measurements we get rather ordinary numbers:Crosstalk is good but again, not state of the art:At this point I went to measure a simple frequency response and got stomped  big time.  No matter what I did, the output would drop off randomly between 8 and 10 kHz.  As mentioned, I messed with the configurator, doing everything in my power to turn off filters, tone controls, etc., nothing helped.  So I dug in with just feeding the amp a 15 kHz tone and noticed that the output would jump up and down especially in one channel!  What the heck is going on????My frequency response testing is at 5 watts as that is what I use in my dashboard.  Turns out this amplifier cannot reproduce high frequencies reliably at 5 watts!  It has some kind of limiter that kicks in and pulls power back.  It also does that at low frequencies but at or past maximum power.  That I can sort of understand but not the high frequency hold back.  To see this in action, I ran my THD+N vs Level vs Power test:Focus on the red line first.  That is at 20 kHz.  Notice how it actually zigzags back and forth as input level is increased, but output level does not.  Or even goes backward!  This must be the \"good\" channel as it produced 10 watts.  The other channel was more finicky and as noted, would get upset at even 5 watts.Problem severity goes down with frequencies but still there at 10 kHz as indicated by the light blue line which zips back at around 180 watts or so.At lower frequencies, the amp simply refuses to increase power and not go into clipping.With this knowledge, I reduced output power to below 1 watt and ran my frequency response sweep:This is line-in so is digitized.  It produces about 48 kHz of bandwidth which is fine.  What is not so fine is that there is a phase shift between channels as frequencies go up:Some kind of filter is active here that is causing a phase shift between channels.  Even if there is some processing active (which there shouldn\\'t be as I disabled tone control and \"SAM\" speaker EQ), it should affect both channels equally as far as phase.Our story ends with my power measurement as noted:This is healthy amount of power at 269 watts with both channels driven into 4 ohms.ConclusionsWhile the Devialet is an elegant looking audio device, it clearly sacrifices usability and reliability/performance to get there.  There is something clearly wrong in the way it handles high frequencies.  No, this is not just me saying that.  It is also buried in the stereophile measurement of another one of their units: https://www.stereophile.com/content/devialet-d-premier-da-integrated-amplifier-measurementsA $10,000 amplifier can\\'t produce more than 20 watts at high frequencies without \"power supply collapsing?\"  Conclusions like this don\\'t help:No, this is not a testament to how good an amplifier can get.  No amplifier should power limit to just 20 watts (or lower in my case) in high frequencies.  We have issues with class D amps generating out of band noise that causes measurements to be low in this regard.  But they are producing full power.  Not so with Devialet. Then we have the phase shift.  Poor usability with \"sneaker net\" style of shuffling SD cards back and forth to make simple changes.And of course the total failure of the unit under a simple industry standard test of power sweep.I feel sad that an amplifier has failed under my watch.  I hope Devialet steps up and makes this right for the owner. ',\n",
       " \" Emotiva PA-1 monoblock class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and unfortunately discontinued.  When it was being sold, it cost $299.There is not much to look at here other than a blue indicator for when the unit is on:It is a balanced amplifier which is nice:There is an automatic trigger as you see. I tested it using always-on mode.I believe this is based on some ICEPower module from B&O (300AS1?).  In use the PA-1 didn't even get warm to touch.  Protection circuit was very good in that if you overload it, it clips but keeps going.  Other amps shut down requiring power cycling and such which an become annoying in my testing.Emotiva PA-1 MeasurementsOur standard dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm (1 kHz tone) shows very good performance:Distortion is at -100 dB which is quite nice making SINAD around 92 dB:This is well above our average of 78 across nearly 140 amplifiers tested to date.SNR is very good nearly matching my target of 96 dB at 5 watts:Multitone shows the same good performance:Frequency response unfortunately shows dependency on speaker impedance:Power into 4 ohm shows early rise of distortion:I cut off the power early in that graph.  If one allows it to go higher in distortion it produces a lot more power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Changing frequency shows what non-state-of-the-art class Ds produce:Namely a transfer function that changes with frequency and much higher distortion.Here is the spectrum of the switching frequency:ConclusionsIt is hard to get perfection at this price point but the Emotiva PA-1 tries hard.  It is a small package that runs cool yet produces well above average noise and distortion ratings.  It is a shame it is discontinued.I am going to put the Emotiva PA-1 on my recommended list.  Hopefully you can find some in second hand market or something.\",\n",
       " \" Yamaha R-N803 Receiver, amplifier, and streamer.  It was purchased by a member (b-stock?) and drop shipped to me.  The R-N803 costs US $750 from amazon including Prime shipping.The R-N803 has AV-style features such as Room EQ but with only two channels of amplification.  It has a retro look which is quite a bit nicer than an AVR though:Alas, beauty is only skin deep.  Those nice vertical controls are loose and have nowhere near the great feel of the 1970s gear with their solid mechanical selectors.  The back panel shows how the video features have been stripped away:As a package, it is much more appealing than the monster size of typical AVR.  So not a bad effort.Internally there are decent size heat sinks, one for each channel.  This is a huge step up from a shared flimsy heat sinks we see in modern AVRs with many channels.  This resulted in high robustness as in my testing, nothing caused the R-N803 to shut down or go into protection mode.  With AVRs it is common for them to do these things even though I still drive them with just two channels.Receiver Amplifier TestingI exclusively used the CD input for my testing.  There is a button for Pure Direct as there is on AVRs so let's engage that and see what we get:I set the volume control to +3 db to get the nominal 29 dB of gain.  Measurements were not that different at 0 dB.  I had to play fair bit to get rid of some ground loops (this is 2-pin, insulated device).  Once there, I was rewarded with pretty good SINAD which is a combined measure of distortion and noise:As you see, the ranking is way above average of just 77 dB SINAD.Switching off pure direct mode however, causes severe performance drop:Noise floor as moved massively up and distortion has increased.  Now we are back in the poor category of AVRs.  Sadly to use Room EQ you need to operate in this mode so you have a tough decision of whether you want to have low noise/distortion or room EQ.Dynamic range in pure mode is good:As is crosstalk:Frequency response is excellent in pure mode as well:Turning off pure (green) causes a sharp drop near 50 kHz which seems to indicate the input is digitized using 96 kHz sampling.  It is nice that this rate is a lot higher than many AVRs use.  Not so nice is the non-flat response even though I set all the controls to the middle.There is plenty of power into 4 ohm load at lower distortion and noise than a number of AVRs:Switching to 8 ohm load and measuring pure and non-pure modes, shows the poor performance of the latter:I had a slight issue with this test.  Just minor wiggling of the speaker terminals caused one channel to get distorted much earlier.  Not sure what is going on with that.Back to 4 ohm load, we see that we have plenty of headroom for momentary peaks in music:And here is our power test with different frequencies:At low frequencies approaching 20 Hz, distortion rises above 60 watts or so (orange).  Otherwise, this is a predictable performance with high frequencies being a bit more distorted than low.  And this is a good thing compared to nasty curves with get in some switching amplifiers.ConclusionsAs a pure, analog integrated amplifier, the Yamaha R-N803 does well.  It produces ample amount of power into 4 ohm with pretty low distortion and noise.  The visuals are also quite attractive.  Digital mode to use such things as Auto-EQ/filters is rather poor due to similar issues in many AVRs.  Sad that Yamaha did not go the extra mile and produce a better subsystem here.I personally don't like to use an AVR as a stereo setup due to their large size and not so pretty face plate.  So in that regard, I appreciate the Yamaha R-N803.Given the good, pure analog mode performance, and nice looks, I am going to put the Yamaha R-N803 on my recommended list. \",\n",
       " ' Audiophonics DA-S250NC class D amplifier (hypex NC252MP) and stereo DAC/Bluetooth. It was requested by a member and supplied by the company. It costs 582,50 € (tax excluded) (US$641).I really like the front panel display.  It has large font and super responsive rotary encoder that is a delight to use.  The power switch and input selections feel good as well.  Back panel shows the fact that only digital inputs are provided:In use the unit was robust in operation and recovered automatically from overloads.Audiophonics DA-S250NC DAC MeasurementsUsing pre-out, I measured the performance of the DAC.  Let\\'s start with our dashboard:I was surprised that I could not get more than 0.8 volt out of the pre-out. Like to see 2 volts.  Likely this is optimized for the gain setting of the integrated amplifier. Distortion is below -110 dB but because output level is rather low, noise drags that down to SINAD of 103 dB.  This is still competent performance:SNR is good enough for 16 bit content:Linearity is near perfect:Multitone is quite good until you get to upper registers:IMD vs level shows that impact of noise level:There were regular pulses at 1 KHz which is the USB sub-packet buffer size:I tried changing the filter settings but they seemingly made no difference:Might as well as this is a fine choice anyway.  Attenuation could be better, hurting THD+N vs frequency:Overall performance of the DAC is not bad.  Question is, is it good enough to not impact the amplifier performance?Audiophonics DA-S250NC Amplifier MeasurementsUsing the same USB input, I measured performance by setting the front panel volume control to -16.5 dB to get 5 watts and change output:This is very good performance, landing the amplifier well above average of all products ever tested:Zooming in:Noise performance is very good, almost meeting my 16 bit minimum SNR at 5 watts:Frequency response is nice in that it doesn\\'t show any load dependency:Crosstalk is better than average of all amps tested:Multitone test shows very good performance with almost no frequency dependency:I could barely get the amplifier to clip at max digital input/volume control:This tells me that we could have a bit more output voltage from the DAC to drive the amplifier.  This impacts 8 ohm more:Note that you want to operate in clipping region but a bit of power is left on the table as far as measurements are concerned.Since the amplifier barely distorts, I could not run my standard max and peak power using 1% THD metric.  I had to dial that down to 0.3% get max power:I was not able to run burst power due to same issue.  Note again that this is a \"good thing\" in that the amplifier just doesn\\'t distort enough to get more burst power.Let\\'s switch the load now from 8 to 2 ohm while also changing the phase angle as to represent capacitive and inductive loads:I am impressed that it handled 2 ohm at all but 60 degrees capacitive.  Output voltage dropped though so you don\\'t get to keep \"doubling down.\"  Likewise we lose output voltage at the extremes of ± 60 degrees at 4 and 8 ohm.Finally, as I suspected, you get double power on glitch with the amp and DAC powering on in sequence, resulting in some noise:ConclusionsThe DA-S250NC caught my eye from the moment I looked at the website.  The combination of a DAC and class D amplifier just makes sense to me for most people who only want a digital input. Many \"smart\" amplifiers exist in this domain but they are usually compromised.  Seeing a DAC married to hypex amplifier and combined with a nice front panel/remote seemed to be the ticket.  In testing, the DAC performance is just good but seems to be mating well enough to the amplifier.  Any more performance and it would kind be wasted there.  So I can\\'t complain much.  A version of this with higher performance DAC and amplifier would be just dandy!  Overall, I like and recommend the Audiophonics DA-S250NC.',\n",
       " ' NAD C 320BEE power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan.  The C 320BEE is a vintage product, dating back to 2003 I think.  The BEE designation is apparently a reference to Bjorn Erik Edvardsen who was one of their designers.  Can\\'t tell if he designed this version or this is based on work he did years earlier.  Either way, I am told it is a \"classic.\"  I don\\'t keep up with such things but I am sure some of you will set me straight if that is, or isn\\'t so.  From what I can tell the original cost was US $399.  So quite a budget piece for a mid-tier brand like NAD.The C 320BEE is typical of NAD design language which is maintained to this day:There are set of tone controls and balance which I appreciate in this day and age when it is removed from most gear.I did not seek out the manual and remain unsure how this thing powers on.  You hit the power button but nothing happens until you press one of the input buttons???Here is the back panel:It is an old school layout with non-removable power cord, jumper set for pre to power map.  And a set of RCA jacks lined up.The unit appears to run cool but there are large holes on the bottom where the amplifier heatsink is and if you touch that heatsink, it gets quite hot.In testing, without undue stress, the unit went into protection and would not reset until I cooled it off with a fan and left it off for a few minutes.  Most amps survive my testing without going into protection mode since I only push them to max power for seconds.Also, in the process of changing my setup for 4 to 8 ohm, the unit went into oscillation, producing 107 watts on its own with no signal.  So there is some instability in the design.  This happened when I changed my load impedance to 8 ohm so perhaps you won\\'t see it if you don\\'t mess with speaker output while the unit is on.To be on the safe side, for the last few tests I put a fan on top to keep it cool and that got it to run very reliably. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:The highest distortion product is at -100 dB.  Since out SINAD (signal to noise and distortion), is only 90 dB, it means there is 10 dB of noise that is degrading that.  All else being equal, noise is less of an audible problem than distortion so that is good.  Take at its value, the C 320BEE clocks much better than many other amplifiers we have measured in this regard:Drilling into the 1 kHz tone spectrum we see the nice clean output of classic AB amplifier:Those of you who hate class-D spectra in ultrasonics, can rejoice now.  Signal to noise ratio is good but is power dependent:I think the spec is a few dBs better than this but I am sure you can mess with levels and volume control position to get there.  Either way, this is plenty clean for CD/16-bit playback.Crosstalk is unremarkable compared to state-of-the-art:Fortunately, this should not be an audible issue as there is plenty of separation between channels here.  Frequency response is broad and quite flat in audible band:Even at 100 kHz, the response is only down 1 dB.  So your high-resolution music can sing without the amplifier truncating their bandwidth.Let\\'s look at intermodulation distortion (two tones at 60 and 7 kHz) versus power output:This is a well-behaved amplifier until it gets to its limit and then clips hard as amplifiers tend to do.  Of note, there is a \"soft clip\" light but I did not see it come on in any of my tests.We can run the same test but with two high frequency tones of 19 and 20 kHz:Forgetting about the ultrasonic ones around 38 kHz, the distortion sidebands remain at -100 dB which is very nice.  You can play your 16 bit content without worrying about any distortion above its noise floor.Most important test is power versus distortion.  Let\\'s start with 4 ohm load:This is very modest level of power but no strangeness in its response.  We can run the test again but compare to modern \"streaming\" amplifiers of today:We have very clean power compared to them but less power as compared to either SONOS or Amazon Link Amp.  The NAD does outperform the NuForce STA-200 though in every respect.  Switching to 8 ohm gets us this:I am puzzled that power output remains identical in both cases.  Something must be controlling that.The graph of distortion versus frequency at power levels is quite messy as it typically is:Putting aside the light pink which is at or near clipping, the amp if well behaved with only a modest rise in distortion as power levels increase.To keep things exciting , I added a new measurement to this test.  It is the \"dynamic\" power according to CEA-2006/490A designed to keep car audio amplifier companies honest with peak power:These are burst power measurements.  Let me know if you like them and I will run them in future reviews.  I think there is some merit to measuring this way as music is not continuous sine wave.ConclusionsNice to go back in time and test amplifiers which were simple to understand and simple to measure.  The NAD C 320BEE seems to have been competently designed for modest power delivery at a budget price.  In that regard, it completely succeeds in its mission.Personally, I think 67 watts is not enough for home listening.  Today\\'s speakers have become smaller in size and shrunk in efficiency, needing fair bit of power to get them to produce proper dynamics.  If you disagree otherwise, or have sensitive speakers, the NAD C 320BEE seems to be a good unit to buy.  It certainly does away with any anxiety you may have with using class-D amplification.',\n",
       " ' Yamaha WXA-50, multi-function DAC, pre-amp, power amp, streaming and multi-room unit.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Even though it came out a few years ago (2016?), it is widely available.  Amazon shows it costs US $478.Success of SONOS as a multi-room audio solution has been the envy of many traditional audio companies.  Many have tried to chase them with Yamaha being one of the earlier ones.The WXA-50 is a surprisingly heavy unit although looks somewhat unremarkable:The case is metal as best as I can tell which is good as the unit generates good bit of heat.  Strangely the heat is concentrated on the left side yet the vents are on the right!  There is an IR hole on the left which confused me to no end, constantly wanting to push it to turn on the unit.  I am not a fan of a single light indicating input and overload condition of the amplifier.  Worst part of the interface is the volume control which has no marking and no display.  Unless you use the app, you have no idea what volume you have set this to.  This made my testing maddeningly hard.I downloaded the App and here, I was pleasantly surprised by the performance and reliability of it.  With no configuration, the WXA-50 was recognized and manipulating its controls were instantaneous and reliable.  I only used the App to reset the EQ, etc. so for its full functionality, you should seek out other reviews.The back panel has extensive set of inputs and outputs although lacks USB:I was pleased to see both analog input and outputs.Yamaha heavily courted the Custom Install (CI) industry to use this instead of SONOS and it shows from inclusion of trigger input and output for control.  Inclusion of Toslink input goes along these lines to fetch audio from a TV being fed by HDMI.DAC Audio MeasurementsI briefly measured DAC performance.  I read however that there are two DAC chips inside this unit (an ESS and Bur-brown/TI) and that the fixed output is driven by the latter.  So this may not be representative of what happens when you stream music into this device:This is decent performance although it degraded fair bit if I turned up the volume on the amplifier to max.  That increased the higher order harmonics even though the output level of the DAC did not change.  We have seen this before and likely is the power supply sagging causing DAC performance to suffer.  SInce you don\\'t listen at max volume level, I did not derate the WXA-50 performance when including it in the performance chart:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsSince we have analog inputs, I started my testing using that and got this for our usual dashboard at roughly 5 watts:I played around with combination of input levels and volume control and performance was pretty consistent.  SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) is actually quite respectable for an amplifier:I tested the same, this time using Roon to stream the 1 kHz tone to it using Airplay:We lose just a couple of dBs although distortion levels are a bit lower.From here on, I tested the unit using its analog input unless specified.Frequency response shows decent bandwidth and flat response in audible band:No strange and limiting digitization of input is visible which is good.Signal to noise ratio is good enough for 16 bit audio:Let\\'s get into all important measurement: power into 4 ohm versus distortion:We are close to meeting the spec (I measure at much lower distortion than they do).  We have cleaner power than either Sonos or Amazon amps although the SONOS has much more power.Here is the performance at 8 ohm:I don\\'t have as much data for 8 ohm but what is there, shows competent performance but with just 55 watts on tap.Intermodulation distortion versus power level tells a similar story:THD+N versus frequency and power shows very predictable performance with no corner cases exposed:Only 20 Hz tones gives it a bit of trouble with rising distortion above 10 watts but that is slight.The unit also shut down at 20 kHz at max clipping level. I reduced the volume level a few notches and that went away even though I was still pushing the unit into hard clipping.Spectrum of 1 kHz tone with no AES filter shows the usual noise in high frequencies we get from class-D amps:While this looks ugly, the spikes near audio band are way down at -75 dB which is very good.  I have tested amps where these levels are much, much higher.The two channels have different switching frequencies.  Not sure if this is on purpose or variation in the clock source of their modulators.  The two beat against each other likely creating the intermodulation spikes that we see throughout the range.ConclusionsUnlike the bag of parts performance I often see in these modern streaming products, the Yamaha WXA-50 seems to have benefited from some attention to raw performance of each subsystem.  There are no funny results, strange pipelines that go in and out of digital domain, etc.  The performance graphs are all smooth with no sudden jaggies or other anomalies.  This makes it easier to use the unit, not having to work around its weakness (I am talking to you SONOS).We also have decent amount of power, approaching 100 watts into 4 ohm which should be plenty.  If you add the subwoofer to it, you will be golden even at high SPLs.The app likewise, gives a feeling of polish that I often find lacking in competing products.In summary, I did not raise an eyebrow when measuring the Yamaha WXA-50.  It won\\'t provide competition to state-of-the-art separate products but it also doesn\\'t embarrass.  As such, I am going to put the WXA-50 on my recommended list.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.I was reading that the standard diet for panthers is large animals such as deer, antelope, etc.  I have not fed anything like that to my panthers and they are starting to mumble \"animal abuse\" under the lips.

       " ' PS Audio Stellar S300 Stereo Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The S300 costs US $1,499 from the company.Fitting the design language of the rest of the PS Audio and using similar enclosure, the S300 is quite hefty considering that it uses class-D amplification:There is just a power switch and light that indicates whether the unit is on, or has shut down due to protection circuit kicking in.The back panel shows very high quality and beefy connectors:As you see, there are redundant pairs of speaker sockets which I assume is an invitation to use bi-wiring.  Or feed the subwoofer using them as Paul McGowan advocates although a warning tells you to be careful as these are floating signals, not ground referenced.XLR inputs are nicely provided which I used for all of my testing.The internal amplification is provided by ICEpower 300AS1 modules.  These are integrated power supply and single channel amplifier modules.   PS Audio uses its own input buffer on these which they call \"Analog Cell.\"  This got the owner worried that it would measure poorly as did the PS Audio Stellar Gain Cell Preamplifier and DAC.  I must say it got me worried reading the description of it too:Seeing how the class-d module uses ample feedback to linearize its response, it is puzzling that he thinks the input stage should be without one.  Either feedback is good ro bad.  Can\\'t have it both ways.Anyway, back to the operation of the unit, it ran cool and never got upset in my testing.  Overall, my subjective impression of the unit is positive.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs always, we start with 5 watt output into 4 ohm and see where we stand:Ah, that is respectable!  FFT spectrum just shows two distortion products with the second one at or below -100 dB.  There is however noise though which pushes the combination of those distortions and noise to -88 dB resulting in SINAD of same amount, only positive.  This puts the S300 amplifier above our median for all power amplifiers tested so far:Our frequency response is a bit variable at the high end:I looked up the 300AS1 response as shown in the inset and is consistent with that.  While most of us won\\'t hear that rise in response, it does show load dependency which means each speaker will interact with it differently.All my tests use an AES-17 filter which has a flat response to 40 kHz and beyond.  But for the purposes of finding the actual high-bandwidth spectrum of the unit, I take it out for this test of 1 kHz tone at 5 watt:Switching frequency is around 450 kHz which is fine.  Typical of many of these class-d modules, the level is high at just -15 dB below signal. @DonH56 recently asked me if the level of switching noise tracks the signal itself so I decided to test for that by upping the power by a good bit to 180 watts and see what happens:As you see in blue, there is good news and bad news.  Good news is that the level doesn\\'t scale with output power much.  Bad news is that its spectrum becomes quite wide so total energy may have increased that much.  Certainly scary to the eye but likely not to the ear.  Anyway, back to our regular programming, here is our signal to noise ratio:Not that good at 5 watt as we could have predicted from the SINAD in the dashboard.  At full power the situation improves but still not very competitive with top of the class switching amplifiers which can clock as high as 125 dB.  So be careful with sensitive speakers.Most important graph for amplifiers is power versus distortion+noise.  Here it is into 4 ohm:We have tons of good power to the tune of 256 watts.  Distortion starts to rise early though at just 10 watts.Here is the response into 8 ohm:Perhaps more revealing is what happens if we perform the same sweep but at different frequencies starting at 20 kHz and working our way down to 20 Hz.  An ideal amplifier would have all the graphs landing on top of each other.  But this is what we get here:At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the graphs indeed nicely land on top of each other (bottom group).  But at 5 kHz and higher, we get very odd responses indicating multiple non-linearities taking turn to dominate.  I thought this was an issue with PS Audio implementation but the same response is shown by ICEPower in their data sheet.Peak power shows disappointing level of headroom available for short durations as would be typical in music:The switching power supplies in class-d amplifiers are tightly regulated which means the power you get in steady-state, is what you get in peak.  Standard class AB amplifiers tend to have variable supply rails which if you don\\'t tax much, will maintain higher voltage and produce more power in short bursts.  For this reason, you may want to get a more powerful class D amplifier to replace a class AB amp.ConclusionsIt is a sigh of relief that PS Audio had not managed to reduce the performance of the ICEPower modules.  Response and sonic abilities are completely determined by those modules unlike what PS Audio marketing says.  The ICEPower module used here has a distinctly lower performance than Hypex modules we have tested in the past. So you are not going to get state-of-the-art performance.  For that, you need to go to amplifiers higher in the SINAD graph.Still, this is a competent, well-built and well-supported amplifier based on proven amplification modules within.  Build quality is much higher than DIY or garage shop amplifiers using Hypex modules.  $1,500 is not a ton of money given these attributes.  For these reasons and good looks of the unit, I am going to put the PS Audio Stellar S300 amplifier on my recommended list.',\n",
       " \" NAD 7050 integrated DAC, amplifier and streaming playback.  It is on kind loan from a member.  It appears the product was announced in 2014 and since discontinued as I can't find it on sale anywhere.  The cost was USD $999 from what I can gather.The unit can be used both horizontally and vertically.  A rotational sensor changes the display orientation conveniently.  Here is its upright position which I consider better for sound since the electrons can naturally free fall into the speaker terminals:The outside has what appears to be some sort of rubber glued to it.  It is soft to touch but picks up dirt very easily and is impossible to clean due to sticky nature of it.The large knobs imply great feel which they don't have.  They wobble as you rotate them.  The larger knob is the volume control which had an odd delay in updating the display as you rotated it.  Overall, a good effort has been made to create an unusual design but didn't quite get there in feel and functionality.The back panel shows off the inputs and speaker output:For my testing, I focused on USB input as I suspect that is the most common interface for consumers.  Alas, the USB interface is class one so only goes up to 96 kHz.  To get the advertised 192 kHz you need to use the other inputs.  I downloaded the NAD drivers which nicely gave me ASIO interface for testing.There is an app to control it and I downloaded it from Android play store.  It is a simple remote control but allowed me to change the audio-out to be full range so I could use it for DAC testing.  Otherwise it is filtered for subwoofer out.  Despite its simplicity the app crashed on me once.There is no analog input so I had do all of my testing with USB digital interface.As expected from a brand name company, the NAD 7050 comes with full set of safety and emissions regulatory certifications.The amplification in NAD 7050 apparently is a scaled down version of what is in NAD M2.  Here is what NAD says about it:My read is that it is a power DAC similar to Lyngdorf TDAI-3400 I reviewed recently.  Measurements will confirm if so.DAC MeasurementsAs usual, where possible I try to isolate the performance of the subsystems, in this case the DAC.  Here is our dashboard view using USB input/Line Out.  I hope you are sitting down if you owan the 7050 and use it as a DAC:What the heck is going on here?  Even at 0 dB the unit doesn't get to 2 volts yet it severely clips resulting all of those harmonic distortions.  Dialing down to -2 dBFS improved performance but just to 83 dB. By then the output voltage was even lower, making it not so useful as a DAC anyway.  My thinking is that this is a split off output from the power amplifier as opposed to a traditional DAC output.   I guess for the assumed subwoofer duty it may be OK.Naturally, with the SINAD as measured falls at the bottom of the graph of DACs tested:After the first bad impression, the 7050 almost nails the rest of the measurements such as linearity:And jitter:Since USB doesn't support 192 kHz, I had to run a different multi-tone test at 44.1 kHz:Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual, the dashboard view is at 5 watts of power into 4 ohm:As power amplifier measurements go, this is not too bad actually and almost matches the vaguely stated 90 dB spec by NAD.Power versus distortion+noise is also pretty decent:The downward part of the curve is always dominate by noise as the output level is low.  Here, that part of the curve is flatter than I am used to seeing which is good as far as level of noise.  Likewise, distortion is kept under complete control until onset of sudden and massive clipping at 54 watts.  This too is good (sans the clipping).  Stated rating is 50 watts at 4 ohm and we beating that a bit which is nice.  Then again, 50 watts is not that much power in grand scheme of things.THD+N versus frequency using my default 45 kHz bandwidth shows pretty awful results (in red):Suspecting ultrasonic noise at play, I re-ran the test with 22.4 kHz (as with the dashboard) in blue which shows that effect quite conclusively.  One channel is worse than the other though which is strange.  Note that the drop above a few Khz is due to bandwidth of the test being too low to capture all the harmonics (and hence the reason I like to use 45 kHz bandwidth normally).Broadband FFT shows of 1 kHz tone shows us what is going on:This is without my Audio Precision high-frequency filter (AUX-0040).  All the other tests used that filter.On the extreme left we see our 1 kHz tone as a spike rising to 0 dB or so.  We have a single and large spike at 850 kHz.  That seems to indicate to me that 850 kHz may be the switching frequency.  Given its high frequency, the power DAC is running likely with as a single bit converter which would create a lot of quantization noise.  Noise shaping is used to push that above 30 kHz or so with the peak at about 80 kHz.  This is the drawback of power DACs as we have seen in the Lyngdorf and SONOS Amp versus class D amplification which doesn't need noise shaping.  You can see the effect of high frequency noise in the thickened sine wave of the same signal in the inset.ConclusionsUsually, by the time I get to the end of testing, I have a good idea of if I like or don't like a device.  Here, I am not quite sure.  Let's agree that no one should be using the NAD 7050 as a DAC with external amplification as NAD suggests in the manual.  You will be listening to a heap of distortion products with anemic output to boot.The amplifier seems to have some good tricks under its sleeves with lower than normal noise and very controlled distortion until a very hard limit.  My issue there is the 50 watt rating for a $1000 device.  That is just not enough power for a product in this category.Seeing how the NAD 7050 is discontinued, maybe it doesn't need my recommendation or lack thereof anyway.  So I will leave it at that.  \",\n",
       " \" Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $89.99 with stock 32 volt supply.  Price goes up to $109.99 with the 48 volt supply.  There is a $10 discount coupon right now.Despite its budget price, the V3 manages to look elegant with the hole pattern on top and large and smooth feeling Volume/On/Off control. Power supply is external and as noted, you get a choice:As you will see later, you really want the 48 volt version:Yes, it is a larger supply but you are going to hide it behind your desk anyway so might as well live the good life with the increased power there.  The amplifier is based on TI TPA3255 class D amplifier IC.  There are replaceable op-amps for those of you who have nothing better to do than mess with the design.When I took the amplifier out of the package, I noticed something rattling in there.  Fearing the worst, I took the unit apart. Turns out one of the two large power supply caps had lost its adhesion to the PCB. The putty used is to keep the cap glued to the PCB was too flexible and had broken loose. No harm though as the cap is laying on its side and can't go anywhere. The sound I was hearing was it moving just a hair up and down and hitting the top of the case.  Suggest company use a different material to fix this.I will post the pictures of the insides later.  For now, a large aluminum couples the amplifier IC to the case. There is no thermal grease but the amp ran cool enough that I don't think you need to worry about it. But if you are, this you can remedy yourself.  Despite me pushing the amp to max power repeatedly, it just got warm to touch.  The protection circuit was the best kind with high tolerance of clipping and audio-restart.Fosi Audio V3 Amplifier MeasurementsI performed the low power tests using the 32 volt supply.  The rest is done with both.  So let's start with our usual dashboard:Distortion is nicely kept to -100 dB so we are noise limited causing SINAD to land around 88 dB.  This is well above average for all amplifiers tested:Notice how many amplifiers it beats to the right of it!Noise performance is also quite good for the class, almost clearing the hurdle for 16 bit content at just 5 watts:Frequency response shows load dependency which all class D amplifiers in this price range show:In English, this means that depending on which speaker you use, the sound may be a bit bright or a bit dull if your hearing extends to 20 kHz.  You can counter with EQ (which you better have for good sound in your room).Multitone and 19+20 kHz show good performance for the class:\",\n",
       " ' Denon PMA-50 Audio (speaker) amplifier with included DAC and Bluetooth.  It is on kind loan from a member. It seems to be discontinued but when available, it cost US $599.  I see it on ebay and such from $370 to $450.The enclosure is more stout and nicer looking/feeling than a lot of products in this category:The volume control is large and nice feeling.  It works a bit odd though in that when you first turn it, it switches the display to volume level but doesn\\'t do anything with respect to changing the level.  You need to keep turning it to have it take effect.There is a headphone amp which I did not test yet.  May do that later.Back panel shows a nice suite of digital and analog inputs but no line out for the DAC:I performed all of my testing with USB and a bit with analog Aux input.Included mains power supply gets rid of the tangle of wires that comes with external supplies.Internally this is a \"DDFA\" design which means it accepts digital input and converts it to PWM for amplification. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI started my initial test with USB input to the amplifier and got this:While not state-of-the-art, performance is above average for amplifiers we have tested with respect to distortion:Using analog input degrades performance fair bit:We lose about 5 dB, mostly in elevated noise level.  Note the channel mismatch when you use analog input as opposed to digital.Frequency response using USB input and high sample rate of 192 kHz, shows the noise shaping/filtering of the digital amplifier:Young people with good hearing may hear some elevated sharpness.  Total bandwidth though is better than some other amps we have tested which truncate at 22 kHz and such.Looking at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone, we see a very well behaved amplifier despite being class-D:Ultrasonic noise is limited to -60 dB.  Some other products have peaks as high as -20 dB here.  There is a single spike at 840 kHz or so, which is likely the switching frequency.Note that I did not have to use my AES filter as I usually do with class D amp.  The analyzer was not confused by the ultrasonic noise as present.Using USB input we get very clean signal until the amp stops producing power:54 watts of power slightly beats the 50 watt specification into 4 ohm.  Alas, this is not much power, relegating the unit to office, small room use.As expected, power drops with 8 ohm load:I suggest getting a 4 ohm speaker to extract the max power out of the unit.Using analog input, we can compare the power at 4 ohm to other amps tested.  Here again, the gain was strange as turning it up to 0 dB, caused elevated noise and very early clipping.  So I dialed volume down and drove the unit to 2 volt input to get this:As we see, its modern competitors all have tons more power.The digital input though does better as we see in this IMD comparison:If the PMA-50 had more power, it would be a real contender here.Signal to noise ratio using USB input at nearly 5 watts and max power yielded this:We barely miss the spec at max power.  Even at 5 watt though, we are reasonably close to noise floor of CD/16-bit audio.  So not bad.ConclusionsThe Denon PMA-50 seems to be competently designed.  It has none of the performance quirks of cheap class-D amps.  It has a solid cabinet and controls to go with that engineering.The big knock against it is modest amount of power and high price relative to competition.  And in this day and age, lack of streaming support.I personally put huge value on power in amplifiers so can\\'t recommend the PMA-50 on that front.  But you have the data and can judge for yourself with your priorities.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.The weather has warmed up and we are having a glorious, dry spring which is unusual for us.  The panthers have noticed the same and have been pestering me for a picnic lunch.  They may seem small in pictures but they have voracious appetite so I need money for food and drinks for them.

       " \" Marantz PM-90 Vintage stereo integrated amplifier.  It was purchased by a member from japan and drop shipped to me for testing.  It came out in 1991 with a price of 160,000 Yen (about $1,500 in today's exchange rate).  I looked online and I can only find one for US $950 but it is more beat up than this unit.I must say, this is one nice looking amplifier with a look that would fit in even today:The feel of the controls is excellent other than volume control which I found a bit loose.  A flip down door gives you additional control including switching between Class AB and Class A mode of operation!  Sadly it requires the unit to be powered down to change so no opportunity for instant switching and comparison.I was pleasantly surprised to see modern, beefy speaker terminals as well:Even more interesting is the inclusion of XLR balanced inputs for CD.This amplifier is back breakingly heavy due to use of two massive transformers.  It is at the limit of what I could lift and carry up two flight of stairs for testing.  Sitting here, my back aches just thinking about the reverse trip to pack the darn thing!  Speaking of packing, it was immaculately double boxed by Hifi-Do with zero impact to it despite the long journey.  Apparently it even came with one year warranty although you have to ship it back to Japan for that.Speaking of Japan, the unit is made for that market and hence 100 volt rating as opposed to 120 volts we have here in US.  If it were mine, I would go ahead and use it at 120 but being that of someone else's and hard to replace, I powered it by both my Lab AC generator and a Variac set to 100 volts.  This may have caused some measurement issues as I noted below.Marantz PM-90 Amplifier MeasurementsThere is a lot here to test due to dual mode of operation and dual type of input.  Let's start with Class A operation with RCA and then XLR:Unfortunately our measurements are polluted by high mains noise and harmonics.  I tried every which way but could not reduce that impact much.  Whether this is due design of the amplifier or longer AC mains connection due to use of lab AC gen or Variac, I can't tell.  As is SINAD doesn't appear to be better than modern AVRs with Marantz on their front plate:However, if we look at the FFT, we see only two harmonics and then it disappears into noise.  Here is the performance of Marantz SR7015 as a reference:Noise from power supply is lower there which aids it in getting similar SINAD.Switching to Class AB mode has no penalty:If anything distortion harmonics go a bit lower although that was not reliable.To see if there is a difference at all between Class AB and Class A, I turned on the residual mode of Audio Precision in the scope display.  This shows us the difference between input and output waveforms.  If there is zero crossing error due to class AB operation, we should see more difference around that part of the waveform but we don't:What is there is mostly power supply noise.  I changed frequencies, power level down to 1 watt and still saw nothing that would correlate with zero crossing distortion which class A is supposed to solve.  Feedback and class AB operation seem to have cured that ailment leaving little room for Class A to do better.Here is the comparison between Class AB and Class A again with respect to signal to noise ratio:Class AB pulls ahead in full power mode because it can create more power.  At baseline 5 watts they are similar likely limited by power supply noise.Crosstalk showed a tiny improvement in favor of class A but it is not material:Bandwidth is good but not exceptional:Notice how amplifier gain changes as you switch modes so for any listening tests, you may have to compensate for that.Class AB of course has tons more power:Overall shape of the graph is average.  Wanting to see the impact of the pre-amp vs power amp, I separated the two and fed the unit with my analyzer direct using RCA:As expected, my analyzer is cleaner but impact is on distortion, not noise which is a bit surprising.  As is one channel being worse than the other.   SINAD reaches almost 100 dB now near full power, good channel, which is very nice.There is a lot of headroom when using class AB vs Class A:Testing amplifier linearity vs frequency we get:Class A power limits more at 20 Hz than Class AB.  Both show very predictable and smooth responses which is great.Multitone tests shows slightly lower distortion at higher frequencies in favor of Class A:Effectiveness of feedback lowers at higher frequencies and likely this is the reason class A does better there.Marantz PM-90 Phono Input MeasurementsIt was hard to figure out a fair way to measure the performance of its phono stage to compare to stand-alone devices.  At first I used tape output but that didn't produce great response.  Best was from pre-amp tap to power amp:Sadly the mains noise is there and dwarfs SINAD.  There is no sign of harmonic distortion so that is very good.  Same situation exists for MC mode:RIAA equalization is probably the best I have measured:That story continues into headroom measurements:You get almost 12 volts of output before it starts to clip!  So pops and clicks should be much less noticeable.ConclusionsThe PM-90 does NOT show its age.  It produces above average performance compared to today's amplifiers.  It does so while running very cool and comfortable.  Not once did it get warm to touch or go into protection.  Push it hard and it just pulls back on the output but keeps going.  Clearly this is a very robust implementation.  Can it compete with state of the art amplification today in the form of Benchmark THX and Hypex/Purifi Class D amps?  No.  There is real innovation there to push down distortion and noise.  But we also have a lot of terrible amplifiers today which the PM-90 easily outperforms and does it with so much style.There is nothing to apologize for and a lot to praise for Marantz PM-90.  I hope the company goes back to these roots rather than horrible looks and performance of much of their AV line.On class A mode, I see no reason to recommend it and many reasons to avoid it.  If you run out of power there, you will certainly create audible distortion.  Whereas any benefit it might have is literally lost in the noise.I am happy to recommend the Marantz PM-90.\",\n",
       " \" XTZ A2-300 class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $500 from the company direct (which is located in Europe).  It is based on B&O ICE 300ASC or its newer name, 300A1.While you won't mistake the enclosure for A2-300 as a high-end, custom design, it has enough extra touches to set it above typical DIY type cases:There are some nice looking vents on the side.   Note however that all the heat is centralized in the center bottom panel as is typical of class D amp modules.  In use though, the bottom barely got warm although I could smell heat generation through side vents.I was disappointed to not see balanced inputs:The gain potentiometer will make the unit flexible but they are typically not good for reliability.  Since these controls don't get used often, then tend to go bad.  If you buy this unit, be sure to turn the control left and right once a few months.Binding posts are substantial which I liked.XTZ A2-300 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm:As noted, I adjusted the gain control to give me roughly 29 dB which is the standard value I use for my testing (and matches the THX recommendations).  Distortion is fairly low at -98 dB or so but there is enough noise to cost you 10 dB and a bit more in the other channel.  This makes SINAD still above average:As noted, noise is somewhat an issue and we can see that in signal to noise ratio:Notice how one channel is 3.5 dB worse than the other.I was a bit disappointed to see frequency response being impacted by my simple resistive load, showing peaking around 20 kHz:More complex speaker loads may make this worse (or better).  Crosstalk is OK:Here is our power level versus distortion+noise at 4 ohm:We see the same noise differential here and some distortion differential as well (although the latter is somewhat common).  Power is way short of 300 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% which is what the spec calls for, we are still shy of that:So definitely not conservatively rated.8 ohm load naturally produces a lot less power:Typical of ICE modules, they don't behave evenly across the frequency range:That is quite a variation in distortion and noise relative to power.  In some sense then our previous tests using 1 kHz are not as representative of the total performance.ConclusionsI started the review liking the enclosure.  But then got a bit more jaded with unbalanced only inputs, and higher than expected noise level, high frequency dependency on both frequency response and distortion+noise. Then again, performance is still above average compared to many amplifiers I have tested.  This produced a quandary for me.  I could recommend it and justify it.   At the end, I decided to not recommend it but without strong feelings one way or the other.  You have the data to decide for yourself.\",\n",
       " ' NAD C268 power amplifier with balanced inputs.  It is kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $900 at NAD dealers (not Amazon, etc.).  The C268 is built on Hypex UcD Class D amplifier modules so in testing it we will get coverage on that as well.  Then again NAD says it is a custom version for them.The front panel looks good and substantial:The unit is nice and light to move around and inside has fair amount of space.  Back panel is nice in the way it provides both balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA input together with gain control:For my testing I used the fixed gain mode to get around any channel differential the potentiometers may introduce.Speaker terminals are nice and easy to use and naturally the unit is properly certified for safety and emissions.  Keep the later in mind as you compare it with any DIY version of the same amplifier modules.  With anything with mains input, I highly recommend sticking with products with safety certifications.In use, the amplifier runs completely cool to touch.  Not even above room temperature it seems.  It never, ever shut down no matter what I did to it.  This is one of the reasons you buy a separate amplifier by the way.  These power amplifiers are far more robust than any in any home theater AVR.Stereo Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard where we feed the amplifier a simple 1 kHz sine wave/tone and ask it to produce 5 watts into 4 ohm load (typical for many speakers).  This is what we get:For some reason the channel in blue has much more second harmonic causing its SINAD -- which is a sum of distortion and noise -- to suffer by 5 dB.  There is always some differential between stereo channels but this is a bit much.  This aside, performance is above average with a SINAD of 87 dB once averaged (click on graph for larger size):Covering the basics, frequency response is very good:Crosstalk (one channel bleeding from one to the other) shape is unusual but fortunately it gives is near state-of-the-art performance where our hearing (more or less) is most sensitive:Noise performance is very good (much better than its distortion metric):You easily clear the CD/streaming content\\'s 16 bit dynamic range at almost any listening level.Getting fancy and using 32-tones to test for distortion/intermodulation we get what we already seen from the dashboard which is good:A power amplifier\\'s job is well, to produce power so let\\'s measure that starting with 4 ohm load:NAD rates the amplifier at 80 watts for both 4 and 8 ohm loads which is unusual.  Fortunately we are beating that with our 4 ohm load, getting 96 watts.As noted earlier, noise performance is very good as indicated by how low the red graphs are until distortion sets in and the graph starts to flatten and rise.  But then we hit a very hard wall at the end.  This is an amp that will sound good until it doesn\\'t.  You will instantly know its power limit for good or bad.There is some hidden good news here though.  Let\\'s measure power at 1% distortion+noise both continuous (like above) and burst:Wow, many switching amplifiers don\\'t produce much more power in burst mode.  Here, we are getting more than double the power to the tune of 230 watts while both channels driven!  This means for momentary musical peaks, you have much more power available than our standard non-burst tests show.Switching to 8 ohms we get what the company advertises:All of these power tests are at just one frequency: 1 kHz.  Let\\'s now run the same power sweep into 4 ohm load but vary the frequency:With class D amps, I expect these lines to have many different shapes and be all of the place.  Instead, they land right on top of each other which is an ideal response.  If you look to the right before clipping occurs though, you see that at the two ends of the spectrum -- 20 and 20,000 Hz -- power does get limited.  20 kHz doesn\\'t need much power as music spectrum is quite low.  But 20 Hz does and loss of power is unfortunate but very common.  The peaks at low frequencies last a while due to their slow \"speed\" (rate of change) which taxes the power supply causing it to run out of juice at lower power levels.Amplifier Bridged Mode PerformanceI usually don\\'t test bridged mode but knowing you rascals, you will immediately ask for it since NAD emphasizes this a lot.  So let\\'s reconfigure the amp into a single channel and see what we get:Company advertises 300 watts but that is likely at higher distortion than what I use in the above graph.  To approximate their performance, let\\'s use the 1% THD+N threshold again and measure again:Now we get the 300 watts continuous.  And better yet, we get close to half a kilowatt of power for peaks!  Nicely done.ConclusionsThe value proposition of the NAD C268 amplifier doesn\\'t look very good at first blush.  Just 80 watts per channel for $900?  Testing shows while that is more or less the continuous power level, for short duration the amplifier can provide far more power.  Combined with the nice and safe build quality, the C268 won my heart.As such, I am going to put the NAD C268 on my recommended list.',\n",
       " ' NAD M10 streaming amplifier and DAC.  It was purchased and drop shipped to me kindly by a member.  It costs US $2,749 from NAD dealers.The M10 sports a very large touch screen LCD display that covers the entire front face:Sorry for leaving the protecting plastic on.  Like to keep things as new as possible for members.As nice as the display is, it simply is not as responsive as your phone or tablet.  What could be really cool such as the VU meter mode, becomes a jittery display that doesn\\'t please much.  A much faster processor with GPU would be needed to really make the display the star.  Still, it is heads and shoulders above others that have small displays.The back panel is notable for inclusion of HDMI ARC input:Alas, I have no ARC capability on my workstation so could not test that feature.In normal use the plastic case barely gets warm.  Under heavy stress of power testing, it got somewhat warm making me wish the case was made out of aluminum than plastic.  You are not likely to push the switching amplifiers this hard and at any rate, the M10 runs much cooler than any Audio/Video Receiver.While I did not have time to test it, the M10 comes with Dirac Room EQ which is nice.I noticed one operational/design issue.  I unplugged the unit to take its picture but noticed that the display went crazy flashing random stuff.  I thought it was a capacitor that was discharging but this continued and would not stop!  I looked in the back and I realized I still had the HDMI cable plugged in.  Knowing that it provides a 5 volt \"hot plug\" signal, I disconnected it and the display finally shut down.  This is improper design.  The device must NOT draw any power out of HDMI connection.DAC Audio MeasurementsI connected the Coax output of my Audio Precision APx555 analyzer to the M10 and measured what came out of the pre-out with volume adjusted for 2 volt output:Distortion is quite low at -110 dB (near threshold of hearing) but the noise floor kept jumping up and down causing SINAD to vary with it.  This shows lack of isolation between sensitive DAC subsystem and busy processor running other functions of the device.  As it is, performance is respectable which is a sigh of relief:Anything in green and blue is good.Testing at other output levels shows that the M10 is capable of pumping out good bit of voltage:Dynamic range clears the bar for 16 bit CD/streaming content but not much more:IMD distortion versus level shows the same noise issue:Filter response also shows higher than it should be noise floor:Jitter and noise test shows a lot of unwanted tones but audibly they are below threshold of hearing:Linearity is very good:',\n",
       " ' Teac AX-501 integrated power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The AX-501 is part of the reference series from Teac so doesn\\'t come cheap as desktop products go.  I see the price at USD $999 on Amazon plus $35 shipping.  There is a discount for silver a USD $899 but Amazon doesn\\'t sell it for some reason.When I reviewed the Teac HA-501 Headphone Amplifier, I heaped praise over its modern retro look.  The AX-501 takes that to an entirely different level with addition of a couple of super cute, yellow background VU meters:What is that?  I should have took the shot with the VU meters working and the light turned on?  Well, the owner played a cruel joke on me by not supplying me with the remote and leaving the setting to off for the VU meter!!!  The controls are almost as nice of the HA-501 with the exception of the volume control which feels a bit stiff and has some slack in it.  Otherwise, there is nothing to fault it as far as I am concerned.Here is the back panel:XLR inputs should be mandatory in this price range and I am glad to see then included here (that is the way I ran all of my tests).  The AX-501 uses a class-D amplifier and runs as cool as you could get in my testing.  I don\\'t think it ever got even warm.  Class D also means light weight and that is NOT the case here. The AX-501 is a very hefty unit for its size.  This means it stays put no matter how heavy your cables are.Notice the lawyers getting their hands on the unit as to indicate the class of speaker wiring you are supposed to use!  But hey, it is good to know the unit has been through corporate filter of certification and regulation.Even though Teac is a Japanese company, the AX-501 is made in China.Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard view using XLR inputs:Even though Teac specs the AX-501 at 1 watt, we see the same performance at 5 watts which is nice. Distortion and noise as stated in SINAD dB puts the AX-501 above average (of 74 dB):It loses to SONOS Amp using its digital input and ever so slightly outperforms the Amazon Link Amp.Signal to noise ratio matches company spec:Frequency response shows identical output for both channels which is a relief as poorly made class-D amps differ in this regard:Roll off is early for my taste.  I like to see flat response to 40  kHz. That said, early filtering seems to help bring stability to performance of the low cost class D amps and I saw that here as I measured power output:There is a broad operating range where performance is good between 1 and 30 watts.  We then run out of juice and clipping occurs at 88 watts.  Rated output is 100 watts although higher resolution measurement may have gotten us closer.The Amazon Link Amp has more power and SONOS even more.  You are guaranteed to hear distortion when an amp reaches its max power rating so on this all important metric, the Teac AX-501 loses to its cheaper rivals.  And of course we are worlds away compared to reference amps like those based on Hypex NC-400.I have added a new test to my power amplifier suite and that is intermodulation distortion relative to measured power.  I ran it against the recently reviewed Klipsch PowerGate Amplifier: We see more evidence of the stability and clean performance of Teac AX-501 as switched/class D amplifiers go.  The IMD graph is also more revealing of distortion set it around 7 to 8 watts and climbing before final clipping.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI ran a sampling of my headphone tests starting with power versus distortion using 300 ohm load:Wow, this is impressive amount of output power at such a high impedance.  I wonder if we are just looking at the output of the power amplifier, reduced with an in-line resistor.  Here is the results with 33 ohm load:Oh, this is not nearly as good.  The reason is this:Sadly, we have a high value resistor in series with the output to the tune of 58 ohm.  I don\\'t like to see a value much more than 10 ohm and ideally, down to 1 to 2 ohm.Best use would be high impedance headphone with relatively flat impedance graph versus frequency.  Otherwise some \"color\" will be imparted on the sound (for good or bad).ConclusionsPersonally I think Teac has nailed the look and feel of such a desktop product.  The AX-501 is in an entirely different class, rivalling Nagra when it comes to switch-gear and meters.  In that regard it is a \"bargain.\"The power amplifier seems competent without hairy corner cases.  It is above average in performance but not rising up to the levels I like to see for $1,000.  As I noted in the review. power is everything and there are much better choices in that regard such as SONOS Amp.  At nearly half the price, it delivers more than twice the power plus a bunch of other features such as included streaming/DAC.  It doesn\\'t look nearly as nice as Teac AX-501 though.The headphone output is a checklist item although it should sound very good with high impedance headphones (I did not test).The AX-501 runs cool and should be quite reliable and safe giving its pedigree.  Overall I \\'like\" the Teac AX-501 but can\\'t recommend it on performance or value.  We should be able to do better for $1,000 so the search continues.',\n",
       " ' Lexicon, first generation DD8, 8-channel amplifier.  It was purchased used by a member and drop shipped to me.  The DD8 came from collaboration of Harman with TI (chip company) to produce very low weight, switching amplifiers for BMW car audio system.  It was then later repurposed in this configuration for the Custom Integration (CI) industry.  It is actually rebranded by a number of companies and sold under their label. Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman products which includes Lexicon.  So keep potential bias in mind as you read this review.All 8 channels are provided in one compact, very cool running 1U rack mount chassis:A stout on off switch manages power duties together with heftiest relay sound you have heard!  The back will seem unusual for hi-fi market but is precisely what the custom integration channel needs:You can either feed the unit individually per channel or a \"bus\" input that feeds the same stereo input to all the channels.  The latter is very handy for \"whole house audio\" where the same music plays in every room from ceiling speakers and such.  A looped bus output is provided to cascade more of these units.Output is provided through phoenix connectors which again is common and desired in CI channel as they are secure but small connectors.  Individual gain controls are provided for every channel.  You can also select mono vs stereo (again, useful in whole house audio where you usually want mono).  And auto-sensing for channels not used.  Trigger is also provided of course.The available units are pulled out of existing installs so likely have many hours on them.  And if the installer didn\\'t know what he was doing, it may have been subjected to high temps.  Indeed the first unit the owner bought did not work right, changing its gain with temperature.  I traced it to the front-end of the unit.  So know what you are getting if you buy them used.Brand new, second generation DD8s cost US $3,500 (through dealer channels). This version listed for US $2,500.  I see them listed for $1,300 right now on ebay but I believe the owner was able to get it much cheaper.Lexicon DD8 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard.  I set the gain to max which nicely gave me 29 dB which is what I have standardized on:This is above average performance with distortion kept below 100 dB;Noise performance is good as well:Ideally we would get 16 bits at 5 watts but 15 is a good effort.I was disappointed by the early cut off from the output filter:This is due to rather low switching frequency of 250 kHz (common values are in 300 to 400 kHz), which made the filter harder to design:Crosstalk is fine:Power into 4 ohm is rather low:The protection circuit was aggressive which made getting max and peak power difficult.  Still I managed to get some numbers:While we get more burst power courtesy of power supply designed for a lot more channels than two, max power with 1% THD+N still was rather low.I then tested the amp using 8 ohm and surprisingly, it produces more power there:To see how the power scales, I measured max power using two and four channels.  Both were the same using 8 ohm:Most disappointing was varying the frequency and producing a power sweep:As you see, there is huge penalty at higher frequencies.  Furthermore, there are power related linearities.ConclusionsIn mid to low frequencies, the DD8 produces well above average performance.  Above that frequency though, distortion increases substantially and other non-linearities surface.  Output seems to have some load dependency while also rolling off early.If you can get the unit for a few hundred dollars, then its compact enclosure and general performance may be a steal.  You could almost push me to recommend it but I am not going to.  I like to see better performance with respect to frequency response and high frequencies.   I think for its intended custom install market, it is perfect (our company has installed a lot of these).  For hi-fi use, you have to make that decision.',\n",
       " ' Outlaw 2200 single-channel amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 2200 costs US $399 plus shipping although I read that it goes on sale for less than that.I was surprised how svelte the 2200 is given its power capability:The diminutive size comes from \"class G\" implementation which varies the power supply with signal.  This sharply lowers the power loss at lower power levels allowing the heatsinks to be much smaller.   Despite its low \"1U\" height, the 2200 is heavy though courtesy of a larger pancake toroidal power transformer.It is always great to see balanced XLR input and trigger capability on amplifiers:In use, the 2200 was solid as a rock.  It never shut down or complain and ran very cool even after full suite of tests.  I was worried about recommendation to stack these from Outlaw but after testing, I think that can be done without much concern.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:SINAD is supposed to be sum of distortion and noise relative to our input signal.  Here, distortion is very low, approaching -105 dB.  So the fact that the SINAD is just 86 dB tells us that the number is dominated by noise as you will see shortly.  As it is, this is above average for some 75 amplifiers tested so far:Here is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and full power:Frequency response is a bit more limited than I like to see:Measured power at both 4 and 8 ohms exceed outlaw specifications:Even more power is on tap if you allow higher distortion or for momentary peaks:Wideband spectrum analysis shows very clean output:Those of you who are bothered by class D switching noise, should be happy to see this.  Indeed I performed all of my tests without an ultrasonic filter on my Analyzer.Thermal StabilityPerformance was rock solid from cold to operating temp:ConclusionsThe Outlaw 2200 monoblocks provides solid performance, easily besting the amps you get in a typical home theater AVR and then some.  Its slim packaging allows you to configure as many channels as you need without needing a lot of space.  Efficiency is good but doesn\\'t bring with it the light weight of the class D.  I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2200 amplifier.',\n",
       " ' Niles SI-2150 Class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  He purchased it refurbished and I see it for sale at $367.  Original cost seems to be US $850.By using efficient Hypex UcD250LP class D amplifier modules, the SI-2150 manages to fit in a small, 1U rack chassis:Niles is targeting this amp as Custom Integration (CI) channel so has good control as far as trigger and such:In use, the unit stayed cool and calm.  When pushed into clipping it will go into protection.  Sadly it stays in that mode until it is power cycled rather than recovering on its own.Nice set of gain controls are provided which lets you get precise channel matching -- something that is rarely the case in many amplifiers.  I set them to 29 dB for my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone dashboard into 4 ohm load:SINAD which is the ratio of distortion and noise versus signal is better than average at 85 dB:Signal to noise ratio ranks in the same region:Frequency response is flat enough in audible band:Power into 4 ohm shows good noise and distortion:Lots of power is available if we allow the distortion to rise to 1%:Response into 8 ohm load is rather odd:Usually we have a declining graph with hard clipping in solid state amplifiers, not this gradual rise in distortion.  As such, it was not easy to determine the clipping point as I normally do.Typical of class D amps, the relationship with frequency and power is complex:Removing my ultrasonic filter allows us to see the switching spectrum of the amplifier:ConclusionsI am not sure at the regular list price but at refurbished cost, this is a steal of an amplifier.  Lots of power in a cool, small enclosure with above average distortion and noise.I am going to put the Niles SI-2150 on my recommended list.',\n",
       " \" Peachtree amp500 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,499.The amp500 comes in the same packaging of many previous Peachtree products. I wish company would innovate here as the design looks kind of dated. Then again it is very unique.  This amplifier comes with balanced inputs which I very much like:When I pushed the amp, the protection circuit naturally kicked it but unlike many other amps, recovered automatically without the need for a power cycle.The back half of the box is empty so the amp module is small.  And there is plenty of ventilation on top.  There was only modest temperature rise in the case post all the testing I did which is admirable.Peachtree amp500 MeasurementsThe amplifier was ready on power up:Dashboard measurement shows above average performance:Noise+distortion as embodied in SINAD is well above median although well sort of state of the art:I could not come close to matching company spec for SNR:Frequency response was flat enough and not dependent on impedance which is very good for a class D amp:Crosstalk was state of the art so I am assuming some kind of dual mono configuration:Multitone was respectable:Let's see how power it pumps into a 500 watt load:That is a lot of power!  The clipping is quite sharp though which when combined with the protection circuit, would not allow me to measure max power.  But I did get peak power:I think spec is 700 watts but we are close enough.  Even at 8 ohm we have good bit of power:High frequencies bother the amp but go lower and linearity is excellent:Finally, we have a new test: power on noise:I haven't run this test on other amps to know if this is good or bad.  Once I do get some mileage on it, we will better know what is going on.  If I were to guess, I would say this is good performance.ConclusionsStory here is simple: tons and tons of power with above average noise and distortion.  A cool running switching amplifier in small package as well.  Really, nothing much to complain about here.I am going to recommend the Peachtree amp500.\",\n",
       " ' Outlaw 2220 single channel amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $399.The look is simple but elegant in its slim form factor.  I like that it is just heavy enough to give you confidence but not so much that you can\\'t lift it.Nice set of features are provided from balanced XLR input to trigger.  A larger toroidal transformer indicates class class AB design (not switching).Outlaw 2220 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm:I like the very low distortion spikes that are around -108 dB or so.  Some power supply noise (120 Hz) and general noise lower SINAD down to 85 dB which is still quite competent:Noise level could be a bit lower at 5 watts but still respectable:Multitone test shows the very low distortion of the amplifier:Frequency response is flat which is an improvement over the 2200 model which drooped at 20 kHz:The word \"monoblocks\" sets up expectations of high amount of power and the 2220 delivers:This should be plenty of power for just about any use.Finally we can examine performance at different frequencies:Some strange distortion mechanism sets in at highest frequencies but only during a limited power range (hump in green).  Fortunately you hardly ever have content at high frequencies at high amplitude so not an audible concern.ConclusionsPerformance of the Outlaw 2220 is solid, solid, solid!  What can I say.  It delivers what you expect with nary any results that raise an eyebrow sans that high frequency distortion.  You have ton of power which should be handy for both stereo music listening and home theater.  At $399 it brings great value as well.I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2220 monoblock amplifier.',\n",
       " ' all-in-one Marantz HD-AMP1 DAC and integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and retails for USD $1,100 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.The unit has a somewhat retro looking of other Marantz audio products with the round digital display and wood sides:There are both digital inputs and analog allowing one to build a complete system around the HD-AMP1.  I was surprised to not see RCA outputs though so no convenient way to use its internal DAC by itself.Amplification is through class-D technology which allowed the unit to run cool.  Without permission from its owner though, I did not put it through thermal stress.In addition to speaker output, there is also a headphone jack so I tested the output through that too.There is a lot of functionality in HD-AMP1.  I chose to test a few of them in this feature and will test more based on requests.MeasurementsI started by testing the DAC+headphone stage using our usual dashboard:As you see, I set the output to 2 volt which is the nominal output of stand-alone DACs.  Alas, performance is nothing to write home about.  Second harmonic distortion is quite high, setting the SINAD at just 85 dB.  This would put in the fourth quadrant of DACs tested (with one being the best).  We also have fair bit of harmonic spikes from the power supply from 180 Hz and up (multiple of 60 Hz mains frequency in US).Loading down the headphone output with 300 ohm, we get this:There are internal gain settings but I did not mess with them.  As it is, level of noise and distortion is quite high relative to desktop DAC+amp products.  Power output however is decent.Switching to the power amplifier, here is the power versus distortion+noise measurement:I have plotted three graphs using three different volume controls with input being swept up to 2 volts.  Distortion climbs less steeply than other amps so hard to know where to stop and measure the wattage.  I selected a conservative point and got 47 watts.  I believe the rating from Marantz is 70 watts using my 4 ohm load.    You could certainly get there and beyond if you tolerate more distortion.As I have noted, the performance is similar to budget amplifiers like NuForce STA-200 (dashed green) but not even remotely getting close to our best in class Hypex NC400 amplifier (dashed blue).  Best case performance is about SINAD of 72 dB or so.Above is with my 40 kHz AES-17 filter by the way.Frequency response was very good for a class D amplifier:And here is the broadband spectrum analysis of a 1 kHz tone:The first large spike comes at nearly 500 kHz which I am assuming is the switching frequency of its class-D amplifier.  Its second harmonic is at nearly 1 Mhz and down -60 dB.Finally, here is the harmonic distortion+noise versus frequency at 5 watts of output using 90 kHz of bandwidth:Once again, it is not on the same planet as the Hypex NC400.  It also has instability when the analyzer switches its frequency as indicated by the \"T\" symbols.  It takes some 5 seconds for the readings to become stable.  We saw this in the Behringer A500 amplifier review.ConclusionsI wanted to like the Marantz HD-AMP1.  It has been in demand for quite a while on the forum to measure it. Having done that, I see no signs of excellence. It follows the drifting backward industry trend of \"good enough\" performance specs.  This is reflected in lack of hardly any specifications provided by Marantz.  On feature side, it is very strange that there is no RCA outputs to use the DAC and pre-amp with a different power amplifier.Needless to say, I can\\'t recommend the Marantz HD-AMP1.',\n",
       " 'This is a follow up to my first test of the Cambridge Audio CXA81.  Results there showed fair bit of noise which was uncharacteristic of other products I have tested from the company.  There were a lot of speculation as to the source of the problem but no data to back any. Fortunately company CEO was kind enough to contact me about a week later expressing surprised at my results. I asked them if they have measurements that are better.  After some investigation, they said that they could replicate my results at their China manufacturing facility but not their R&D lab. I expressed that I no longer had the unit so there was not any work I could do to get to the bottom of this.  I was offered a new unit and offer for payment to test again. I accepted the second unit but turn down the offer of payment.In the communication, I was asked (as some members had also suggested) whether I lifted the USB ground using the switch in the back.  I had not and ran those tests on the second unit.  This is with the unit grounded:The low frequency noise was much lower in this sample but you can still see the channel in red showing a wide spectrum of high frequency noise.  This reduced its sinad fair bit compared to the \"good\" channel.  Lifting the ground made that better but created a new problem:At first it appears that there is more harmonic distortion given the spikes at 2, 3,4, 5, etc. KHz.  But that is not so.  USB micro packets are 1 Kbytes each and frame boundaries are showing up there as leakage from digital to analog circuits.  So lifting the ground is really not a good solution here although I appreciate it being there as it may help some systems.Post this we had a conference call with the designers of the product.  Issue was brought up that this is an instrumentation thing that the Audio Precision analyzer is creating a loop and ground noise that would not be there.  While this is true, I explained that I have tested hundreds of DACs that don\\'t have this problem.  I have once in a while seen this but it is exceptionally rare.  Since overall results were more positive than the first sample, I offered to re-run all the measurements and post them.A problem which we did NOT have a disagreement was, was the output limit of the pre-out.  Like many AVRs, this is lower than I like to see at 1.5 volt.  Above that it will saturate and distortion will increase.With this intro, let\\'s get into the measurements.  Company has seen all the measurements and agrees with them.CXA81 DAC Measurements (Sample 2)I wanted to break the electrical link between the analyzer and CXA81 so started my DAC testing using Toslink optical. Here is our dashboard:Note how I have picked the max output before output saturating.  If we sweep the input level we see the full range of output relative to distortion:As you see at 2 volts, we get down to SINAD of 75 dB which is what I measured with the first sample at that output.I next switched to USB input:We see noise intrusion reducing SINAD by a few dBs relative to TOSLINK optical.  Here is a key discovery though: this is NOT due to USB input but mere connection of USB cable.  You can see that noise even with Toslink when I have USB plugged in (but not used as an input):Turns out this noise issue will proceed to corrupt the measurements of all other subsystems and was the reason why the amplifier for example did not perform well either in the first round.  The impact with this second unit is lower than first sample though.  This could be due to noise conditions changing on my test system (nature of computers and grounding) or something is different in the second sample.To eliminate USB noise as a factor I continued the rest of DAC tests using Toslink so let\\'s go through them quickly:Linearity test was impacted by another rare issue which is power supply noise very close to the test tone of 200 Hz I use here.  There is a strong bandpass filter here but not enough to get rid of that:We see clear jitter sources but they are benign audibly:IMD test shows more noise than I like to see but is very good at the limit, beating my reference DAC in blue:Here is our reconstruction filter:And THD+N vs frequency:Pre-amp MeasurementsHere again we see the impact of connecting the USB cable or not while testing analog in/analog out:Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard:This is above average for all amplifiers tested to date and far better than noise-induced measurements of the first sample.  Distortion is at -100 dB which is very good.Power sweeps are much improved due to lower noise:We see that in various frequencies as well:The lower amount of noise allows distinction between the test tones.ConclusionsThe second sample combined with not connecting USB cable shows CXA81 in much better light.  Performance is competent now for the class and transparent for most uses.  Where would one put the blame for noise being induced using USB?  Me? Instrumentation? Vagueness of computer audio/grounding?  Some or all of the above?  When testing AVRs, I have started testing with Toslink to remove issues related to HDMI.  I should have opted to do the same here but did not since I consider the unit in a different class.  Still, I take some blame and should have done this before returning the unit. As I expressed to the company though, this is not a problem that other devices have so I implore them to investigate how to use this variability. After all, your system may be much worse than my configuration as your downstream devices and upstream computer may present even a worse situation. One likes to take comfort in thinking \"one digital input is the same as another.\"As it is, you have the tough situation that you can\\'t leave USB cable connected lest you degrade the performance of the rest of the system.  If you don\\'t have an audible issue, this is not a concern but if it is, experiment with removing USB cable and see if fixes the problem.For me personally, USB connection is critical and about the only input I would use on such a combo device.  So the above is not something that works for me.  But may be fine for you.I also like to see output levels of 2 volts for unbalanced without saturating.  We are seeing AVR/AVP companies going this way.  No reason to do different in a combo device like this.  Higher output level gives better freedom to use external amplifiers.Finally, let me express my sincere and deep appreciate for Cambridge Audio and company CEO for accepting the challenging results of the first test and working with me on better clarity and a constructive path forward.  In that regard, they earn highest levels of respect from me.  I look forward to quality products from them that come across my bench.',\n",
       " ' Allo Volt+ D class D amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $129 in this \"dual mono\" configuration with stepped attenuator.I am not a big fan of these clear cases but in this case, pun intended, it works!Hard to take a picture of it though without heavily accentuating dust and such that normally is not visible:Dual TI TPA2116 class D amplifiers are used plus a front-end switching power supplies to generate the required plus and minus supplies.Not that no power supply comes with this amplifier.  You have a choice of what you put in there.  I used my lab power supply at its max setting of 31 volts and 3 amps.  It could use more than 3 amps with 4 ohm load as the power supply current limited near max power sweeps.  It was fine with 8 ohm load though as that doesn\\'t need as much current.There is no remote control so this is really a desktop amplifier.  There is a gain switch below that switches between 19 and 26 dB.  I used the default 19 dB which works well with desktop DACs that have no trouble producing near 2 volts you need for max power.Overall the Volt+ D makes a very positive impression with respect to looks and build quality.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is nice!  Budget class D amps routinely produce SINAD in 55 to 65 dB and here we are well above that at 84 dB:I was also impressed with how low the noise floor was at 5 watt playback:Many amplifiers fail to achieve 96 dB which is my target for this level of playback.Crosstalk is superb, better than just about any amp I have tested recently:Frequency response has a tiny bit of roll off at 20 kHz:As I noted in the introduction, with 4 ohm load my power supply lacks enough current so I also tested with one channel driven:So it seems that getting the 60 watt advertised power level is possible.Taking advantage of onboard capacitors, I ran my burst test:So even in stereo you have over 60 watts, going to nearly 90 watts with one channel.Power into 8 ohm load is naturally lower:Notice that noise floor is very low contributing to very good response at lower power levels.Varying the frequency gives us the following power levels and distortion:At or below 1 kHz response is excellent and frequency independent.  Above that it varies which is typical of many class D amps.Finally, I ran a spectrum analysis without my usual class D amp filter in the path:Wow, TI put some clever filtering/design in there.  Usually the switching frequency is down just 10 to 2 dB from our main tone.  Here, nothing rises above -88 dB or so!  TI advertises that the amp will not interfere with AM radio and it definitely won\\'t.ConclusionsThe Allo Volt+ D amplifier is a delightful surprise.  Careful design has elevated the performance of these switching \"chip amplifiers\" to that of mass market hifi/class AB designs.  Yet, it runs cool and costs very little.  Yes, you need an external power supply and that is the only flaw I see with going with this solution.  Overall, I am happy to recommend the Allo Volt+ D for its nice and elegant design and performance especially at this price.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of Amazon Echo Link Amp power amplifier, DAC and network streamer.  I purchased this from Amazon for USD $299 and it arrived yesterday.While rather featureless from front, the overall feel of the plastic and case is quite good:When you rotate the volume control white LEDs light up to show a coarse volume control.  They time out very quickly though so I could not capture them on the camera.Not sure what the hole is for.  Maybe it is for a remote control but none was provided.The back panel is the more interesting bit:In addition to the power amplifier, we have a nice little DAC and pre-amplifier here.  There are digital inputs in the form of both Coax and Toslink S/PDIF.  And of course we also have streaming capability with the Ethernet jack and wifi.  Surprisingly we also have S/PDIF and Toslink output for digital connectivity to other DACs and amplifiers.There is analog input and output.  Former can be used for your analog gear and the latter, for use as a DAC or pre-amp.  There are issues with this mode though.  See later in measurement section.Operationally the Link Amp runs very cool.  However at higher power there is an audible mechanical hissing sound likely caused by resonance of an internal inductor.  It was audible to me from 3 feet away without use of speakers (dummy loads).As you can imagine for a product with Amazon name of it, there is a professional looking label underneath with every regulatory and safety certification you would want to see.  This is important as the Link Amp like many other power amplifiers is mains operated with a lot of high power circuits.  Oddly there is no power button.Sadly there is hardly any documentation provided with the unit.  You are supposed to seek help in the Alexa app.  I naively assumed that connecting ethernet cable would mean the Link Amp wout get instantly recognized by the app but such was not the case.  I had to configure it using Wifi with the mess that is: connecting to local ad-hoc wifi it creates and then using the main home network.  Process was quite non-intuitive and took multiple reboots of phone and link amp to get it to finally recognize it.  Boy, do I miss the simplicity of the original echo.  Oddly, Alexa app provides no control over inputs!  I just fed it S/PDIF and it output that. Ditto for analog.  Can't tell what priority it will use if both are active.There is a volume control in the app but it only controls local/streaming content, not the volume control on the Amp.  Really?  The volume control is digital so why can't I control it in the app???Amazon has really lost its way here with respect to software here.  Added complexity over time has not been managed.Also at fault is the computer and networking industry that has not invented a new revision of Wifi standard that just works with devices like this.Overall, my impression of hardware is positive and software negative.Anyway, let's get into measurements.  With so much functionality here, I have chosen a subset to test, mostly focusing on the amplifier performance.DAC MeasurementsI was happy to see line out so thought we can check the performance of the DAC this way.  Alas, this was not meant to be as without a load, the amplifier shuts down when you turn up the volume to max to get the nominal voltage you like to see on a DAC.  There should be a software option to turn off the power amp so it doesn't do that.  So I had to connect my dummy loads to the amp to test it.  Here is the outcome:The power amplifier reduced performance by about 5 dB. SINAD was 92 dB or so without the load.  The current values put the Link Amp in the lower tier of DACs tested:It would have gone into a tier higher if I didn't have to run the power amplifier along with it.Here is the DAC frequency response which was promoted by later test results:The 44.1 kHz sampling results are fine.  What is not fine is that no matter what other sample rate you use, you get the same bandwidth!  In other words, while higher sample rates are accepted, everything seems to be down sampled to 44.1 or 48 kHz.  So forget any dreams you have of high resolution audio.Power Amplifier MeasurementsImportant note before we get into this section: during testing the results were a complete mess at lower frequencies.  The graphs were literally not readable with very high variations of THD+N.  So I spent a few hours with my son working through it and turned out some of these class-D amps cause frequency modulation at low frequencies which throws off the analyzer notch filter.  The result was that THD+N would go from correct value to 20%+ which would totally screw things up on the graph.  I found a good work-around for this which made the measurements look a lot nicer.  Alas, this means you can't quite compare these results to previous measurements where this issue was visible.  Fortunately we had very clean amplifiers such as Hypex NC400 without this issue so those results stand.Let's start with power amplifier dashboard st 5 watts using digital input:When I tested the SONOS Amp there was a lot of degradation with analog input so let's test that:Ah, a sigh of relief.  Performance actually improves a bit using analog in!  Noise floor is flatter and lower although not enough to make the SINAD any different.  Putting that value in context of other power amplifiers tested, we get this:I updated this graph with the digital input of SONOS which nicely outperforms the Link Amp.  However, as noted with analog input the Amazon Link Amp is much better.Frequency response with digital input shows the same bandwidth limitation that the DAC did:Same test with analog input shows a droop at low frequencies as well:Note that even when using analog input, you are limited to the same 24 kHz bandwidth!  Someone didn't want you to mess with high resolution audio no matter what.  That aside, there is now a low frequency roll off too.Here is the signal to noise ratio:Let's deal with the most important test: power output versus distortion and noise:Compared to other budget amps like the $199 Topping TP60, there is much more power here and at lower noise and distortion.  Don't like one channel having more distortion though.A more direct competitor is the SONOS amp which costs twice as much but otherwise has streaming functionality:The Link Amp has better noise level but that is because SONOS has poor performance with its analog input.  The SONOS has tons more power and its two channels are staying in synch.  So the SONOS is a better deal here putting the cost aside.  Of course neither comes remotely close to our reference Hypex NC400 DIY build (at > $1,000).There has been some interest in running jitter tests on these power amplifiers.  So here is a snapshot of that:The THD+N versus level and frequency where my new tests show much cleaner results:Note that I have limited the bandwidth to 61 kHz. That is enough to capture the third harmonic of 20 kHz but low enough to keep the ultrasonic noise that these amps have.  I will show that in a bit.  Here we see that distortion rises with low and high frequencies.  The curve though matches how our hearing works in that we are much less sensitive in low and high frequencies so the distortion products are likely not audibly a problem.  Note then that testing at 1 khz shows the best case scenario for these class D amplifiers.I have another variation of above where I sweep the level/power and keep the frequency the same:We see that at 20,000 Hz, the two channels perform the same.  But as soon as we lower the test to 2,000 Hz and then 200 Hz, one channel gets a lot worse. This tells me there is insufficient power supply capacitor reserve for one channel than for the other.  The lower frequencies are more taxing this way because they stay at their extreme peaks of the sine wave longer.Lastly, here is our ultrasonic spectrum of a 1 kHz tone:We see our sharp spike around 600 kHz indicating that is the switching frequency.  The rise in ultrasonics around 100 khz shows noise shaping (pulling noise out of audible band and stuffing it here).  Levels for these are quite low as class-D amps go, showing good attention to filtering, no doubt helped with the limited bandwidth of 24 kHz.ConclusionsMechanically and from safety and emissions point of view, Amazon Echo Link amp delivers for just $299.  This puts it way ahead of many offerings in this price range which are more akin to DIY efforts than a polished product.  On top of that, you have streaming, DAC and a digital and analog pre-amplifier.  This is a lot and I suspect Amazon is losing money on each one or barely breaking even.While some attention has been paid to produce a performant product, there are clear limitations and issues here and there.  Limiting of the bandwidth to 24 khz in all modes is a miss objectively but not subjectively.  As with other class D amps, we have odd behavior here and there such as rise in low frequency distortion, ultrasonic noise.The mechanical whistling while the amp is pushed should have been caught and fixed although in practice, the music should mask that well.At $299 with so many features and generally good performance, I am going to go ahead and put the Amazon Echo Link Amp on my recommended list.  No, it is no audiophile find.  But for secondary use its performance is good enough to make it a good buy.\",\n",
       " \" Peachtree GAN400 stereo balanced (input) amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,499.I am not generally a fan of peachtree audio product looks but this one in coffee stain looks pretty good.  Other than a power switch, not much else is there.  Ditto on the back side:The claim to fame of this amplifier is use of GaN transistors which in theory simplify the design of a class D amplifier (a bit) and improve its efficiency (a bit).  And in theory, it can also produce lower distortion (in open loop anyway).  The drawback is much higher cost of the transistors compared to MOSFETs.  Let's see if the performance is there.Peachtree GAN400 MeasurementsI performed all of my testing using XLR input.  Let's start with our usual input of 1 kHz with output into 4 ohm to the tune of 5 watts:There is fair bit of inconsistency between the channels with respect to SINAD.  I switched my loads and issue persisted so it is not my setup.  Averaging the two we get 84 dB which is slightly average for all amps tested but not where performance should be:Frequency response is disappointing as it shows load dependency:This means that the high frequency response will be speaker dependent which is not good.  I expect this kind of performance in ultra budget amplifiers (under $100), not at this price.Noise performance is good but again, not where it should be:Same for multitone distortion:Crosstalk however, is superb indicating two independent amplifiers:There is lots of power both at 4 and 8 ohms:As noted though, the curve starts to go up prior to clipping which means distortion is increasing.The amplifier more than meets its 400 watt spec at 1% THD:The shape of THD+N graph is very smooth which perhaps could be attributed to GaN transistor design:There is no pop on power up but there is when you shut it down:The amp is stable on power up so no need to leave it on:Peachtree GAN400 Power Stress TestWith the owner's permission , I subjected the amp to varying load angle (phase) and down to 2 ohm impedance.  It did very well:Variations of ±60 degrees did not bother it at all at either 4 or 8 ohm.  A bit strangely, at 2 ohm it would not run with 0 load angle but did produce half the output at other angles (hard to see in the 3-D graph).  Since minimum impedance is 2.5 oh, we can't fault it for this.  FYI I tested a couple of amps at my disposal and the both got quite unhappy with varying phase angles, shutting down and such.  Whereas the GAN400 marched through this test without once going into protection.ConclusionsI just bought a 65 watt GaN based USB-C charger and am amazed at how small it is.  The buzz from there has travelled to audio and has resulted in GaN based amps like this Peachtree.  Alas, there is no performance advantage that can be seen in this implementation.  Noise+Distortion is only slightly better than average and far cry from top performing amplifiers we have tested in the past.  Combine this with quite high price of $2,500 and this is a difficult offer to swallow.  Good news is that there is plenty of power at 400+ watts independent of the load (4 or 8 ohm).Personally I don't see a reason to pay so much for this level of performance so I can't recommend the Peachtree GAN400 amplifier.\",\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A07 Pro stereo amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs about $90.As you see the distinguishing factor from some of the other Aiyima amplifiers is inclusion of tone controls. Alas, that is also where the problem is with this unit: there is no detent and no way of setting its response to flat. Worse yet small changes in the dials will make large differences in tonality. So while I like having toner controls, I definitely like to see a tone defeat feature.  Otherwise the unit feels nice to use and operate.  As is typical, the power supply is much larger than the amplifier itself:AIYIMA A07 Pro MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into a pure 4 ohm load, driven to stereo at 5 watts:We expect good performance from AIYIMA and we get it:Switching to my PowerCube Loadbox, we can simulate more complex loads: (1 channel tested)As you see, performance is essentially the same.Noise performance is good enough for this class of budget amplifiers:Multitone shows good performance:Frequency response unfortunately is load (speaker) dependent:So you may be forced to use the treble control to adjust high frequency response for your speaker.Crosstalk is very good:Let's get into all important power measurements starting with 4 ohm:This is plenty for desktop use.  Switching to 8 ohm naturally robs us of fair amount of power:Fortunately vast majority of speakers on the market are 4 ohm nominal.To see stability of the amplifier, let's subject it to suite of loads and reactive components:An ideal amplifier would follow the red line.  We are essentially there for both 8 and 4 ohm.  Surprisingly this little amp managed to also keep running at 2 ohm, albeit without capacitive component and some power drop.  Many amps simply shut down and won't even work into 2 ohm.\",\n",
       " ' Peachtree Nova 300 integrated amplifier with DAC and phono stage.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,199.  The Nova 300 fits in the same chassis Peachtree has successfully used for last 15 years:It is quite beefy and heavy.  Volume indication overloads the LED indicators on the input selectors showing a coarse 8 levels.  For this price, I would expect an LED indicator of the actual level.Back panel shows good quality connectors and rich feature set for a desktop amplifier:Peachtree made its name on DACs and had quite a following 10 to 15 years ago.  I was curious to see if they had upgraded the DAC subsystem since that time so let\\'s start by measuring that subsystem.Peachtree Nova 300 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit over USB input, sampled the output from preamp out and adjusted the volume to output 2 volts:Well, this is quite disappointing.  Noise and distortion as represented by SINAD is in decidedly \"poor\" category in today\\'s market:The unit can output higher levels so let\\'s see where peak performance is:No luck there as the peak is actually at 1 volt out.Dynamic range is better indicating distortion is the problem:At this point I didn\\'t see a need to run more DAC tests and switched to testing the amplifier.Peachtree Nova 300 Amplifier MeasurementsFor this test I used the Aux analog input:Ah, this is very respectable and above average performance:SNR is not as good as I like at 5 watt but gets better at full power:Crosstalk is excellent:Frequency response shows a peaky filter though:Multi-tone results indicate \"good enough\" performance:What was most impressive is the amount of power available from the ICE amplifier module they are using:Since I am driving two channels, this is over 900 watts of power!  Indeed the peaks hit 1000+ watts:Even at 8 ohm there is copious amount of power available:Interesting to see little dependency on frequency until we hit a few watts:ConclusionsIt is clear from the measurements that the DAC subsystem is a relic that is simply behind times.  The product though benefits from using a competent B&O ICE module which has stayed competitive producing far more power than you would expect in a \"lifestyle\" product of this kind.  As such, I expect subjective performance of Nova 300 to be excellent regardless of what speaker you attach to it.  I usually don\\'t worry about price/performance in my reviews -- that is yours to worry about.    But here, the price seems quite high relative to the other internet focused amplifiers which have come out in the last couple of years.  Some of those are powerful and all of them cost a lot less than the Nova 300.Overall, I can\\'t recommend the Peachtree Nova 300 as a new purchase.  ',\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio BT20A stereo class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 IC. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $99.99 with 32 volt power supply.Despite its low cost, the case gives a feeling of quality. I am not usually fan of tone controls in low cost amps because you can never set them to flat response (the detents are there but don\\'t work). As you will in the measurements, Fosi has made sure that they work correctly in this instance.  A stout power switch controls power. In addition to 32 volt supply, company also shipped the optional ($40) 48 volt supply which is quite a giant:As you see, Bluetooth input is also supported.FYI there is an included orange volume control knob to give the unit some color.Fosi Audio BT20A Pro MeasurementsThe tests are in 48 volt unless I say otherwise (I had mistakenly assumed it was the standard, not the 32 volt).  Here is our dashboard:Notice the great channel match in addition to very good SINAD which represents noise and distortion.  Same is true with 32 volt supply:This nicely lands the BT20A Pro in the \"very good\" category of all amplifiers tested regardless of price:Zooming in to see the competition:SNR is good for the class:I expect load/impedance dependency in this class of switching amplifiers but here, the peaking is almost entirely out of band which is good:Seeing how you have tone controls anyway, you could tailor any peaking with adjustment of the treble control.  Won\\'t be exact but should be good enough.That aside, note how the response is more or less is flat in audible band with the treble and bass controls set to their detent, center position.Multitone is good enough for the class:Crosstalk is very good:Let\\'s start our 4 ohm power measurements with 48 volt supply:Wow, this little box can pump out some serious watts, albeit in the short term testing!  Switching to 32 volts cuts this down even though 4 ohm is mostly current limited:The larger power supply must have more capacitor reservoirs than the 32 volt.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally see the biggest hit to power: [',\n",
       " ' IOTAVX SA3 integrated stereo amplifier with built-in DAC and subwoofer output.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs £399.00 (on sale from £449.00) on company\\'s website.  Hard to find it on sale in US but found one ebay listing for $498.SA3 nails the industry design with svelte chassis, dot matrix display and judicious use of backlighting for the logo: I left the plastic on the display as otherwise it looks nicer than it does in the picture.  A reassuring power button is the left and a nice feeling rotary control handles the volume.  If you press it, it becomes an input selector.  Very nicely done.Back panel shows a lot of inputs:There is phono input which I did not test.  I did test both analog input and Toslink digital input.  Sadly there is no USB input.  There is bluetooth but no streaming support over network.Let\\'s get started by using the line in (analog) input to the power amp and work our way out to the DAC section.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWith integrated amplifiers with volume controls, I adjust that to produce roughly 29 dB of gain which is a THX \"standard.\"  That gives us this dashboard:Distortion dominates with second harmonic telling the full story.  Wish channel 2 was as good as channel 1 but this is typical.  Averaging the two we get this kind of ranking:So above average among 89 amplifiers tested so far (!).  But not state of the art by any stretch.Noise performance is good:You almost clear the CD\\'s 16-bit dynamic range at 96 dB at 5 watts output.Typical of class AB designs, bandwidth is abundant:Should the zombie apocalypse come, you can hook up a few hundred yards of wire to the speaker wire and have yourself an AM transmitter power amp!!!  A microphone and simple modulator and you could be talking to people thousands of miles away at night....Crosstalk is surprisingly good:If you look inside the chassis, you realize why.  A toroidal transformer is in the middle with each amplifier nicely separated from each other by good 8 to 10 inches.Power output at 4 ohms falls a bit short of the spec:And I am not too happy about the constant rise in distortion from just 1 watt, ending worse than one of our worse performing Audio Video Receiver (the NAD T758).It is a bit happier driving an 8 ohm load:That\\'s not a lot of power though so best get an efficient speaker is 8 ohm is the language it speaks.Fortunately burst power is quite decent (only 4 ohm shown):Changing the frequency of the test tone hardly bothers the SA3:Other topologies such as Class D make a mess out of this measurement.DAC Audio MeasurementsTaking advantage of the pre-amp output, I fired off a few DAC tests to get an idea of how good that subsystem is starting with our digital dashboard:OK, this is a bit disappointing.  You want a SINAD here that is 10 dB better than the amp for it to be transparent.  Here it is actually a couple of dB worse then the amplifier which means the combo will drag down the performance of the amplifier some.As a DAC, it falls in the failing (red) category of all DACs tested to date:Noise performance is decent:Intermodulation+noise test is disappointing:The upper line in orange is a phone dongle!  The SA3 hugs that performs like it is related to it which it should not be.Jitter performance looks better than it is due to high noise floor potentially hiding other spurious tones:So overall the DAC portion is barely a match for the amplifier.  If the amp gets the grade B, the DAC gets a C+.ConclusionsIt is nice to see a fresh take on the integrated stereo amplifier from IOTAVIX.  The SA3 looks attractive, has good feature set including many inputs from digital to analog and takes up little space. You can nicely put it under your monitor, add a couple of speakers and be in business.You don\\'t get to brag its measured performance but what is there \"is not broken\" which is often an accomplishment in world of audio.  Performance is solid across the board with the DAC trailing a bit.  I would happily use it in a secondary system.Overall, I am going to recommend the IOTAVIX SA2 amplifier.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of Living Sound Audio Electronics Voyager GAN 350 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US 3,000 from the company.I really like the high-end look of this amplifier case:Strange though as there is no power indicator, nor switch.  The latter is in the back only:I really dislike the hard to read type on the back.  Other than that, the connectors seem to be of good quality.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses GaN transistors to ostensibly lower distortion and increase efficiency of the amplification.  In use, the bottom where all the modules are mounted barely god warm so efficiency is good.LSA Voyager GAN350 MeasurementsI started my testing with XLR inputs which showed really odd results:As you see, the gain is nearly 10 dB different between the channels.  I looked for configuration switches but couldn't find anything.  After wasting half hour, I switched to RCA input and problem vanished:If I were to guess I would say the XLR input is miswired on one channel.  Bad execution if so in such an expensive amplifier.  For the rest of the test I stuck with RCA input.Signal to noise ratio while OK, is not state of the art:I like to see full 16 bit/96 dB dynamic range at 5 watts.  We fall short here.Frequency response was sad to see:Class D amplifiers have a low pass filter that can interact with the load if not designed well and that is what we have here.  The impact falls clearly in audible band.  This would be OK for a budget amplifier in $100 range but not in this class.  Depending on what speaker you hook up to this amplifier, the highs may be exaggerated or filtered.Crosstalk on the other hand was exceptional due to dual mono design and no crosstalk through the power supply:Multitone performance was also very good, indicating low intermodulation distortion:Power was healthy into 4 ohm albeit with unexceptional distortion and noise levels:There is still plenty of power available even into 8 ohm:Interesting how distortion keeps rising and clipping is rather soft.  As they state, this indicates low amount of negative feedback.Transfer function is frequency dependent with distortion rising quite a bit at higher frequencies (likely due to that low feedback level):Spectrum of switching frequency shows good attenuation but not that high of a frequency:If they had opted for higher speed which GaN transistors allow, the impact of the output filter would have been lower (and possibly above audible band).The amplifier doesn't need any warm up as it is stable on power on:ConclusionsOther than having a lot of power and good efficiency, there is not much else to be happy here.  Clearly companies are using GaN as a buzzword without fully taking advantage of what it can provide.  Lots of money is left on the table here in many areas from frequency response load dependency to high amount of distortion.  At the end of the day, you have an expensive, high power amplifier here with average performance.I can't recommend the LSA Voyager GAN 350.  Performance is not there, nor is quality control.\",\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier with Bluetooth support. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $139.99.It is so nice to see a VU meter on an amplifier!  This one actually seems high quality with nice ballistic response (fast jump, a bit slower retard). Bass and Treble controls are there but I wish there was a tone defeat as well. The position of the indicators is where I had to set them for more or less flat response. I do like the very fine detents on it, allowing you to more precisely adjust them at least.The included power supply is one of the largest I have seen but is rather light for its size:There are no remotes so the amp is for desktop use.  Class D implementation means the amp ran with no temperature rise even after all my tests. Protection circuit was excellent with automatic restarted after overload. The meter is useful in this regard as the amp shuts down when the meter is almost at the end of its range.AIYIMA A08 Pro MeasurementsI warmed up the unit for about 10 minutes with very stable response:Running our dashboard we see the usual good performance from AIYIMA amplifier range:Performance is above average despite the very low cost:Noise level falls in the same category of very good:As noted, there was a bit of a struggle to get flat response:And typical of their designs, there is load dependency.Crosstalk was above average for all amplifiers tested:Multitone performance was very good:This little box outputs good bit of power at 4 ohms:Even with 8 ohm load you have good bit of it:Transfer function (frequency vs power) is pretty good for class:ConclusionsAIYIMA has a good class D platform which they turn into various configurations with good success.  The A08 Pro is no exception.  You get unique looks and to some extent, functionality at still a very reasonable price.  With 100 watts per channel, both driven, you have very nice capability to drive any desktop speaker to its limit.  My own wish is the remedy of the load dependency but otherwise, this is a job well done.I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier.',\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A07 desktop amplifier based on TPA3255 class D amplifier chip.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  The cost is US $72 on Amazon including prime shipping.  And as of this shipping, it also included a 32 volt, 5 amp switching power supply.  Member also purchased and sent me a 48 volt/3 amp power supply which I also tested.The case is standard budget audio affair:The volume control feels cheep but does the job.  The back panel terminals were way too small for my binding posts:The DC input socket was quite stiff especially with the 48 volt power supply.  Tightness is not a bad thing as far as power transfer is concerned but this was a bit too stiff.  Here are the two power supplies:They both feel kind of cheap as they would be at these prices ($21 for the 48 volt one).  Personally I would not leave these plugged in permanently if I am not around.  The included power supply has a two-pronged AC cable that was not polarized.  Rotating it around made a small difference in mains leakage.AIYIMA A07 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohms:As you see in the FFT display, there is considerable amount of mains leakage at 60 Hz.  This tends to be a function of switching power supplies.  I played with grounding and improved it a lot in one channel but not in the other (not shown).  SINAD did not get impacted since it is bound by distortion harmonics.  As it is, performance is above average:Signal to noise ratio is not great due to the mains hum:Frequency response is well behaved, albeit with a slight droop at 20 kHz:Crosstalk is good and well above bargain basement desktop amps:Power is everything in a small amp so let's see how we do with 4 ohm load:As expected, with low impedance of 4 ohm we are current limited so the 5 amp stock power supply does better, turning in 77 watts.  Yes, the 300 watt rating is a fantasy but maybe it can do better with momentary peaks.  Alas, its aggressive protection circuit would shut it down and not let me test max and peak power.Naturally the higher voltage power supply does better with 8 ohm load where we become voltage limited:Sweeping power vs frequency and distortion shows a very well behaved class D amplifier:ConclusionsTraditionally these desktop amplifiers have produced really poor performance in the form of noise and distortion.  Not so anymore.  These TPA3255 based amps seem to have good bones in them, producing above average performance for peanuts.  Alas, you are saddled with two boxes and cheap and potentially non-safety compliant parts.  For desktop use, these are probably acceptable compromises.  I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A07 based on its performance.And with this, our last review of 2020 comes to an end!  Nice that it is ending on a happy note.  \",\n",

       " \" AIYIMA A200 stereo amplifier with USB DAC and Bluetooth. It was sent to me by the company and costs about US $160.The compact size should fit on desks well.  Controls are simplicity in themselves: push in the volume control to select input (RCA or Bluetooth/USB).  Rotate for volume.Nice to see built-in power supply unlike other AIYIMA offerings that required large external ones.  Design is based on TI TPA3255 IC.AIYIMA A200 MeasurementsLet's start with RCA input:SINAD which represents a measure of noise and distortion is above average:Unfortunately digital input degrades that some:So the rest of the tests are with RCA input.  SNR is good for class:As is distortion as represented by multitone:Frequency response is flat enough but is load (speaker) dependent:Crosstalk is good:Let's see how much clean power it can produce with 4 and 8 ohm loads:Allowing for 1% THD we don't get more power but burst delivery is higher:For a desktop amp, this is pretty good amount of juice.Sweeping at different frequencies shows very predictable response:Of note, power doesn't drop much at 20 Hz which is very good (and important).Finally the amp is good more or less when you power it up:ConclusionsAIYIMA once again shows that it has as solid hold in the mid-power amplifier market with above average performance at bargain prices. Integrated power supply solves one of the hassles of their separates and provides nice turnkey solution.  Interface and build is good for the class.  So really, if you want a competent amplifier with good power and little money, you have it.I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A200 amplifier.\",\n",
       " \" Hegel H95 integrated amplifier with DAC and streaming support. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2000.The H95 looks pretty nice:I really like the large, high resolution and very responsive graphic display. What I don't like is the absence of power button on the front face.  After some research I found out it is on the bottom.  I realize without it there is symmetry but the one or two times that you play something super loud and want to rush to shut it off, you will hate the fact that it will take some effort to reach under to power it down.  Another thing I didn't like is lack of acceleration on volume control.  You have to crank and crank it to turn it all the way up and down.The back panel shows the extra connectively over a standard analog amplifier:Very nice to see built-in DAC and Ethernet streaming.  What is not is the maximum supported sample rate of 96 kHz over USB.  This tells me they are using ancient and obsolete USB interface.  They say they did this for ease of design and to save money to put toward making the DAC itself better.  We will see about that.A simple plastic remote control is provided which is very similar to what we see from Chinese desktop manufacturers.  I tend to like it but it is unusual for such an expensive product to come with this kind of remote.  Usually they include some heavy but harder to use remote.Hegel H95 DAC MeasurementsThis being an amplifier, I immediately jumped to measuring that part of it first.  But then I had to backtrack when I noticed digital input performance was worse than analog.  Given the line out, I decided to measure the DAC using coax input.  For some reason, like a Hegel DAC I tested in the past, my ASIO4ALL interface would not see the USB input so I decided to test with Coax.  Here is our dashboard with volume control adjusted to produce the nominal 2 volts:I don't need to tell you that this is stunning high level of distortion, landing the H95 seven from the bottom list of some 350 DACs tested:When sweeping IMD distortion level, we can see part of the problem:This is something we see in Audio/Video receivers where they set the optimal gain to drive their amplifiers and not the 2 volts we are looking for.  Even then performance is not good, barely showing less noise than a $9 phone dongle!  We can measure the noise itself:This is horrid performance in any modern DAC.Back to distortion, we see that again in multitone test:Jitter performance is lackluster and what I would expect to see from random ebay DAC:To finish our suffering, here is poor linearity measurement:I think they may have unseated Schiit with their multibit DACs and poor linearity!Really, really bad showing.Hegel H95 Amplifier MeasurementsI first started with line in and adjusted the volume to get the nominal gain of 29 dB we use in integrated amplifier tests:Noise and distortion is just above average:I expected a lot better as the company's claim to fame is a comparator which supposedly detects distortion and sends an inverted signal to the amp to correct.  We see plenty of amplifiers without such circuit performing far better as you can see in above graph.  And of course we have products that use true feed forward technology such as Benchmark AHB2 currently occupying #1 spot in above graph.What's more, there are stability issues with that circuit (my guess).  Check out the warm up performance of this amplifier:I have never seen anything like this.  Variations are quite large (as much as 3 dB) with two very large spikes.  It never stabilized even though I let it warm up far longer than other amps to tune of 17 minutes.  Best case performance was actually when the amplifier was just powered on at 80.5 dB SIAND but then finishing at 79.5.  Switching to DAC input which one would hope would eliminate source of external noise made things worse, not better in that regard:You are losing 9 dB in SINAD due to much higher noise floor.  Why or why?  Again, AV receivers do this but I don't think I have measured this kind of degradation before when using digital input.So from here on I focused on analog input.  Here is our dynamic range:I like to see 96 dB at 5 watts but 91 is fine.  The max power performance doesn't improve much because this is not a very powerful amplifier.Crosstalk is also good:Frequency response is flat in audible band:Power output is just 63 watts into 4 ohm at the knee of the distortion curve:Allowing for more distortion and busting sharply increased available power:Power into 8 ohm is very low for this expensive of an amplifier:Checking for frequency dependency we see something limiting power before the amplifier naturally doing so:Hegel H95 Headphone AmplifierI usually don't bother testing headphone output on this type of amplifier as it is usually an afterthought.  But company talks about improving its output and noise level relative to prior products so I decided to test it some.  Here is our power curve into 300 ohm:I like to see 100 milliwatts of power here and 80 is close enough.  Switching to low impedance, we should get a lot more power but we do not:The guarantee reason is high output impedance and that is precisely what we have:I am amazed that in this day and age companies like Hegel are not aware of the fact that high impedance is bad for many headphones (changes their tonality) and that even budget headphone amps have impedance below 1 ohm.  77 ohm is just out of the question.ConclusionsLet's quickly agree that both the DAC and headphone amplifiers are junk.  They are better off leaving both out.  You can do better with hundreds of products that cost the same as the shipping or tax of the H95.  I watched one video where the youtuber said he preferred the sound of Hegel DAC to his Chord Mojo in some ways.  Wonder what he thinks now.The amplifier in H95 is good as far as noise and distortion but nothing to write home about.  Continuous power is very low for an amplifier costing $2000 however.This is just a bad attempt all around.  I can't see any reason to recommend Hegel H95.  Company needs to go back to the drawing board and design performant DACs and headphone amplifiers as a minimum.  On amplification, they are being left behind by proper feedforward designs and excellent class D with tons of power. \",\n",
       " ' SMSL DA-6 stereo desktop class D amplifier. It was sent to me by Shenzhen Audio and costs US $99.Ah, what a pleasure it was to unpack the DA-6 and see this nice thin packaging!  That niceness extends to the back, fixing one of my main complaints with compact amplifiers:Instead of stacking the binding posts on top of each other and thereby making it very difficult to put large binding posts, they are lined up horizontally.  This allowed me to connect my locking banana plugs into them with relative ease. Of course we are saddled with large laptop power supply running at 24 volts at nearly 7 amps.A remote control is provided to navigate through the menus to change bass/treble settings, volume control, etc.  Same can be done with the front panel and rotary control.A new Infineon class D amplifier IC is used here (didn\\'t see the model number).SMSL DA-6 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard:Relative sum of noise+distortion as expressed in SINAD lands the unit above average of some 350 amplifiers tested:I am assuming volume is controlled digitally given the perfect channel balanced.  Noise performance by itself is good for the class:Frequency response in EQ bypass mode still has a bit of low frequency roll off:Type of speaker you drive with this little amp could benefit from being pushed to play those low frequencies.  I thought I could fix that by boosting the bass setting one notch.  That tool though brings a sledgehammer to a nail being put on the wall to hang a picture:Oh, I forgot to mention that there is no load dependency which is something we often can\\'t find even in expensive class D amplifiers.  Not only that, the response is quite extended, going beyond 100 kHz!  I guess this is what they mean by \"high-resolution.\"There is no warm up requirement as the unit is stable out of the box, running quite cool:Multitone performance is again good for the class:Output power is more modest than I wanted to see but I guess you can\\'t have miracles:The response though seems dependent on level and keeps changing at micro level.   We see the same when we sweep with different frequencies:There is no headroom as expected:ConclusionsSMSL nails the industrial design and usability of a super compact desktop amplifier offered in attractive aluminum case.  A clear white display shows the volume control and inclusion of remote control lets you place it out of the way and still change its volume.  I don\\'t usually take price into account but in this class I must.  For $99 this is a lot of performance and good lucks/design.I am happy to recommend SMSL DA-6.',\n",
       " ' B&K Components AV30.2 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The AV30.2 is discontinued but is available on the used market for low price I am told.  I found one listing with asking price of $175 but not others.  The good news is that it uses the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE class-D amplifier module so the review should be relevant to other amplifiers in the market now.The B&K amp is targeted the CI (custom integration) market meaning it is usually installed in home and businesses by a dealer/installer as part of a larger system.  This amp for example could be hidden behind a flat panel TV powering a couple of speakers.  For this reason, the form-factor and connectivity follows the requirements for this market.Here is the front panel:The \"business end\" is on the back:As you can tell, there is fair amount of connectivity for home automation.  I did not investigate them but I imagine you can power the unit on and off remotely to say, synchronise with the TV being turned on/off.I liked the level control for both channels.  It is buttery smooth, putting many other volume controls to shame.  Using that, I was able to get perfect match between the two channels -- something you can\\'t hardly do with any modern amplifier anymore.The speaker connections use phoenix connectors which while super common in CI industry, was not the greatest choice here.  It was very easy to have the outputs short out if you left any copper sticking out the screw terminal.  In use, the connector did not make tight enough connection causing the performance of one channel to vary as much as 20 dB.  It was tight by feel but noise level would go up and down if I wiggled it.  For intended application probably did not matter.  If you want to use it for hifi home application, you may want to hard wire them if you run into the same issue I did.In use, the unit barely got warm to touch.  There is plenty of ventilation on top and bottom which helps in this regard as does the high efficiency of its switchmode power supply and class-d amplification module.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard at 5 watt into 4 ohm:I adjusted the output gain to 29 dB which means the controls were near max.  Performance may vary some at lower gain values.  I used 29 dB since it is probably the most common/THX recommended gain level.THD+N was 0.008%.  The 50ASX2SE spec from what I recall is less than half at 0.003%.  The discrepancy may be due to gain stage, the connector and just variation in units.  Overall, it is in the ballpark of what they advertise.   This translates into a SINAD above mid-point of all the amplifiers we have tested:Signal to noise ratio is just good enough for 16-bit audio playback at 98 dB at full power:On right is the same measurement but relative to max of 5 watts.  SNR does not drop much which is very good.Frequency response was dead flat in audible band and quite well-behaved with output filtering:Wide-band FFT spectrum shows ugliness that we typically see in class-d amps (at 5 watt here) and this is probably a more uglier than the normal picture:More of a visual scare though than audio.Most important measurement for an amplifier is power versus distortion and noise.  Let\\'s start with the common load of 4 ohm:As you see, one channel started to deviate as I said in the introduction.  But still, both of them are smooth and well-behaved giving us a power rating of 42 watts before hard clipping sets in.At 8 ohm, power level drops a lot as you would expect:Funny there though in how much lower noise and distortion the AV30.2 has compared to the NAD T758 AV Receiver (in dashed blue).  Would be a good replacement for it had it had more power.  If the modules higher in range have same performance, they may be a good application to power home theaters.That said, these modules have almost no headroom as their peak power is almost the same as average:This is because unlike class AB amplifiers, the power supply in these class-D amps is regulated and so other than some storage in output caps, can\\'t provide more juice for short periods. Another sign of good design is how the performance of the amplifier varies with level and frequency:Each line pair of the same color (solid and dashed) is at a different frequency.  An ideal amplifier would not care about frequency so all the graphs would land on top of each other.  Here, they vary some but much less than some other amplifiers I have measured.ConclusionsThe B&K AV30.2 provides competent performance across suite of measurements.  It runs cool, is efficient and small.  It easily outperforms mass market AVRs for example.  Alas, there is not a lot of power here so other than desktop speaker application, I would seek out something more powerful.Overall, I am going to put the B&K AV30.2 and by implication, the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE on my recommended list for mid-level performance amplification.',\n",
       " \" Niles SI-275 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The SI-275 is discontinued.  But since it is sold to the custom integration channel, they come up used and in working orders (companies pull out gear wholesale to redo homes).  I am told it can be picked up as low as US $100 to $150.  I see one on Amazon for US $230.  But there is a used one on ebay for $100.The look is fine:I like the tall feet on amplifiers to allow for more air flow.  A massive heatsink goes the full width of the unit with beefy transistors.  Love the fact that it has two trim resistors to balance the gain in both channels.  So annoying that these days balance controls are impossible to find yet amplifiers routinely have gain that is different in each channel (causing slightly shift in imaging).Back panel is simplicity in itself:In use, the SI-275 was solid as a rock.  Never shut down.  Never complained even when fully clipped.  The top of the unit barely got warm despite using traditional class AB amplification.  That large and heavy heatsink does a great job of spreading the heat load.  Nothing remotely like flimsy heatsinks in mass market stereo amplifiers or audio/video receivers.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our dashboard:Notice the perfectly matched channels.  SINAD is middling but is actually better because distortion is near -100 dB.  It is pulled down by power supply noise which due to being low frequency is not very audible.  Using what we have, performance is slightly above average:Noise performance follows the same standard:Frequency response is dead flat in audible band and extends way up:The wider the bandwidth, the more challenging the design (if not done well, the amp can oscillate).  Power into 4 ohm is healthy:Allowing for 1% THD+N, we get even more:8- Ohm power is:Response with bot loads is very controlled with no oddities.  Amplifier was stable as soon as powered on and performance did not change much after running for a few minutes (not shown).ConclusionsThe Niles SI-275 is made for abuses of custom integration channel which routinely stuffs amplifiers in places they don't belong (i.e. lack of circulation/cool air).  Its construction is well beyond today's mass market product.  Measured performance is just above average.  Combine these with prices as low as just $100 and you have a great deal.I am happy to recommend used Niles SI-275.  Bargain shoppers rejoice!  \",\n",
       " ' SMSL SA400 switching desktop power (speaker) amplifier.  It was sent to me by the company for testing and costs US $660.The SA400 is a powerful amplifier yet it comes in the same compact SMSL package and UI you would find in their desktop amp:Amplification is provided courtesy of ST Micro STa516BE.  The marketing material for SA400 shows a digital feedback but I don\\'t see that in the ST specs.  I am not clear if this is an addition by SMSL or it is part of ST amplifier chip that they don\\'t talk about.  Either way the input to the amplifier is digital so even though we have analog inputs, they need to be digitized to be used internally:A resonant LLC switching power supply provides the heft juice needed to drive this amplifier in a small package.  Bluetooth input is provided as well as a subwoofer output with low pass filter.  In addition, tone controls are included using a dedicated JRC chip.There is an informative temperature measurement you can turn on which I did as you see in the picture above.  With normal music listening (one channel) the unit stay pretty cool.  In testing however, the case got fairly warm and the display indicated 58 degrees C.  I suggest not stacking anything on top of SA400.One issue is a mechanical whine from an internal coil.  I can hear it even when nothing is playing from about 1 foot or so.  When testing at higher powers, this became much louder but when playing music, you won\\'t be able to hear it most likely.  SMSL SA400 MeasurementsThere are three gain settings but performance is very similar between them.  I adjusted high gain for 29 dB which is my standard (defaults to 30 dB):For the rest of my testing I used the adjusted high gain for better comparison to other integrated amps adjusted the same way.Distortion is around -90 dB but what pulls down SINAD is the rather high noise floor.  This causes the overall ranking to be just slightly above average:Indeed we can see the noise issue in our SNR measurements:State of the art amplifiers get 16 bits of dynamic range at 5 watts so we are two bits short here.  Even at full power you are adding noise to a 16 bit signal (you want your amp to be cleaner than the noise in the source).  This, and the fact that there is no bandwidth above 20 kHz nukes any idea of playing high-res content:Sure would have been nice to use an ADC that was running at 48 kHz, not 44 as it seems to be.  Use of the ADC is likely the reason the noise floor is higher than it would be otherwise.  We have seen this in AV receivers which likewise digitize their analog inputs (unless you put them in \"native\" mode).There is some very good news though. The feedback for the amplifier is taken post filtering which means it can compensate for the interaction between that filter and the load.  The above measurement shows actually two graphs: one at 8 ohm and the other, 4.  Both land on top of each other showing the amp doesn\\'t care which is great.  We only see this in the best class D amps like Hypex Ncore and Purifi.Crosstalk was very good but unpredictable:You can see the normal trend in the other two amps (dashed lines).Most important test for any amplifier is how much power we have and how much distortion and noise so let\\'s look at that at 4 ohms:This is a powerful little amp, producing nearly 500 watts of power especially if you allow some peaking:It complies with the spec which I think is 220 watts.  Power naturally drops at 8 ohm but still healthy:On our last test which is power versus distortion+noise at different frequencies.  The output was quite unique:I have not seen a power amplifier show this level of frequency independence.  Yes, having only 20 kHz bandwidth helps but still, even linear amplifiers don\\'t produce such dead straight and sameness the SA400 is producing.  This is quite excellent.Note that the the amp went into protection at both 20 kHz and 20 Hz in this sweep.  Alas there was no indication on the display. I had to power cycle the unit to get it to work again.SMSL SA400 Amplifier Listening TestsEven though I listen to every headphone amplifier, I only do so rarely for power amplifiers.  I decided to start doing listening tests with this amplifier which was a good thing.  I used an Infinity 253 speaker for my testing.  Despite driving only one channel, the SA400 drove the R253 with extreme authority and clarity.  Tons of detail and dynamics with little else to wish for.  Putting my ears next to the tweeter I could hear a slight hiss but a few inches away it would disappear.  The sound was so enjoyable I am still listening to it as I type this!ConclusionsSMSL brings us an interesting and unique power amplifier to us.  Love the load independence and small packaging plus tons of power.  Performance drops to average levels in some areas but nothing that appears to be faulty or poorly engineered.  I guess my one reservation is the cost.  I am not sure how much of this is temporary given the world order with component shortages, high shipping costs, etc. but to me, the better retail target would be $499.  The warranty is short at 1 year as well.  For DACs and such I am not worried about warranty much but for amps I do like to see longer warranty.Overall, I am going to put the SMSL SA400 on my recommended list.  It delivers tons of power with no weak points. ',\n",
       " \" Crown DCI 4 | 300N four channel DSP and networked professional amplifier. It was kindly purchased (used) and sent to me for testing and costs US $3,511.There is only a power on/off on the front. I wish there was a processing bypass as well. The full capability is visible on the back:I wouldn't be able to scratch the surfaces of all that this amplifier can do.  Suffice it to say you can do full processing (speaker and to some extent room EQ), environment/remote control, and transmission of digital audio over Ethernet type cabling.  Configuration is available using Audio Architect software.  Typical of these Pro applications, it takes a bit of effort to get used to its operation but after that, it seemed easy enough to use.A rather loud fan turns on during power on testing and then goes off.  Alas, during my testing it came back on.  Unless the amplifier is way away from your listening spot, better plan to put it in another room/dedicate closet.Connections are all through screw terminals. Not so bad for speakers but for balanced/unbalanced input, you are going to need to have bare wires (upper right phoenix terminals).  Not the end of the world but don't expect to buy and power on the same day if you don't have these bits.I was disappointed with the trim controls in the back.  They are very coarse and hard to adjust to an exact value.  And being on the rear makes it harder to manipulate.  For its intended application of professional installation is not a big deal but for one-off testing/use, is more work.I chose to test channels 3 & 4 as my standard setup is stereo.  During use, the amplifier case did not rise above ambient but again, the fan was running the whole time.Note: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and we move probably more Crown amplifier than any system integrated on the west coast.  So feel free to read bias into my subjective remarks.Crown 4|300N Amplifier MeasurementsUpon power on, output noise+distortion was quite stable which is nice:So on to our 1 kHz dashboard @ 5 watts into 4 ohm load:I must say, I expected much worse performance!  Distortion is below -100 dB and SINAD as a result, is dominated by noise.  As is, performance is a bit above average of many amplifiers tested to date:As noted, noise floor is somewhat high causing SNR at 5 watt to be below desirable level (90+ dB):Using default settings (which is how I conducted all of these tests), this is our frequency response:I was surprised to see the response not being flatter at 4 ohm.  Still, we are talking about less than 0.5 dB.  Importantly, there is slight change with load change to 8 ohm, indicating small amount of load dependency (which you could correct using DSP subsystem).Multitone yet again displays the low levels of distortion:Crosstalk is better than most amplifiers I measure:We have healthy amount of power into 4 ohm:And get even more when we allow 1% THD+N:Switching to 8 ohm load, we naturally get less but there is still good bit of power on tap:I was disappointed to see distortion rise though above 1 kHz as power increased:On the positive front, there is not much impact at 20 Hz so you can comfortably use the amp to power subs and such.Finally, turn on and off behavior is very good:Do notice the long time to turn on though (nearly 20 seconds).ConclusionsNice to see that as we go up in price performance of a pro amplifier improves as well.  No, it is not state of the art but this combination of four channels with sophisticated DSP and audio streaming is not easy to find in consumer domain.I am going to put Crown 4 | 300N amplifier on my recommended list.\",\n",
       " ' Behringer NX1000D power amplifier with DSP.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Can\\'t tell if it is discontinued or not but see it on sale at one place for $299.  Retail cost is $549.I am a fan of orange displays and NX1000D delivers on that (sorry my sample is not powered on):What I am not a fan of, pun intended, is the super loud fan that stays on all the time.  I walked away to go to the bathroom and was so surprised that I could hear it from very far distance in the house.  Unless you can put it in a sealed cabinet, I don\\'t see it being useful for hi-fi use.  Maybe you can modify it to quiet the fan or make it temperature sensitive. On the positive front, I really liked the look and feel of the control app that talks to it:The only thing I did not like about it is that it is not clear when some processing is on or off.  For example above, is the peak limiter on or off???The back panel shows SpeakOn connectors:And of course combo XLR/1/4 inch balanced inputs.  You can bridge the two channels although I did not test this configuration.  The \"1000\" designation is for total amount of power available.  As you will see, I was not able to come close to that in stereo use with 4 ohm load.Behringer NX1000D MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is average performance as amplifiers go:But it is good for pro amps.  SNR falls in the same category:Best in class amplifiers produce 96 dB at 5 watts and we are pretty shy of that.  So be mindful of background noise you may get out of your speakers if they are sensitive.Frequency response thankfully is load independent as the company advertises: Due to inclusion of DSP though, your bandwidth is severely cut to that of 44.1/48 kHz sampling.  So \"no high res sampling for you!\"Crosstalk was surprisingly good for the class:As I hinted, power delivery into 4 ohm is way under specifications:Even allowing for 1% THD and burst mode, we can\\'t get to the company spec:How did they get their 300 watt number?  Using car stereo \"standards?\"Power drops quite a bit into 8 ohm:Just 78 watts in a pro amplifier???  This is AVR class amount of power, not what you see in this class of product usually.Multi-tone test shows distortion increasing at both low and high-end of the spectrum:We see the same in our power testing versus frequency and distortion+noise:Notice how the 20 Hz distortion rises unusually what way.ConclusionsWe, the home users, look to pro products to get more wattage on the cheap.  Behringer unfortunately doesn\\'t give us that here.  Instead, it saddles the product with a loud, non-temperature sensitive fan which rules it out of many applications we may have for it.  So I don\\'t think it is a fit for what most of us want out of an amplifier even though there are some good qualities like load impedance independence, DSP, low cost, etc.As is, I can\\'t recommend the Behringer NX1000D.',\n",
       " ' five channel Classe Sigma AMP5.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and originally cost US $5,000.  I see one on ebay for $1,900 right now.This is one heavy amplifier for a class D architecture:At first I thought it had a linear power supply and its transformer was the reason behind the weight.  Alas, looking into other reviews and pictures inside, it uses a switching power supply.  So all the weight is from the enclosure and likely the very thick front plate.At first I was hoping that the glossy front where the logo is, is an LCD display with VU meters and such.  But there is not.  It is just for looks.  I must say as high-end products go, it is not that attractive to me relative to the high cost of the enclosure.  It has sharp corners which is not nice.The back shows quality selection of parts:I like the staggered speaker binding posts which makes it easier to plug things in.  XLR connections is what I like to see in an amp in this price range and we have them.  This amp was mated to their processor of the time which I suspect is discontinued longer than this amp.Amplifier MeasurementsI tested two channels (Ch1 and Ch2) using XLR input.  Here is our dashboard:Rather high second and third harmonics dominate causing the overall ranking to be middle of the road:Nice to see precise channel matching though.Frequency response showed unexpected results:Researching I found out there is an analog to digital converter which explains the sharp cut off.  I thought that meant DSP functions but there is none.  Instead, the digital signal is used as part of a protection circuit.  I can see that as a parallel path but not as the main path compromising the response this way.  This amp came out in 2015 so it is not like we didn\\'t have higher sample rates available then to at least go up to 48 kHz and get us flat audible response.Signal to noise ratio is middle of the road as well:Crosstalk is \"OK\" but should be better:Power vs distortion shows odd response at 4 ohm which gets worse at 8 ohm (see later):Very strange noise response at the start and the multiple sources of distortion take over, each causing their own non-linearities. On the positive front, we have healthy amount of power.  Not much more is available though in burst mode (typical of class D amps with their regulated power supplies):Here is power into 8 ohm:That step function is quite bizarre. Worst measurements came when bandwidth was increased to 45 kHz and frequency sweeps were used:No way this amplifier is so well behaved.  Instead I think there is high amplitude noise that is masking any distortion present (until clipping).  We can see that if we perform a wideband frequency analysis:We see sharp increase in noise right above audible band.  This is either caused by noise shaping in the ADC, the Amp or both and explains the previous graph.There is naturally switching spikes (near 400 kHz) but I am disappointed that its level is just 8 dB or so below our fundamental.  I like to see 20 dB or more attenuation. ConclusionsThis is a custom Class D design and switching power supply from Classe.  It clearly shows deficiencies of the design and creating a market for Hypex to come and show how class D is done.  Digitizing the input is not a good idea if there is no user benefit to it and there is none here.We could get depressed about the above or look at copious amount of power this amplifier produces while remaining cool (a bit above room temp in testing).  Since lack of power is the #1 reason amps sound bad, I am going to put enough emphasis on this as to not give it a failing grade.Overall, I am neutral on the Classe Amp5.  At current sale prices, you have about $400 per channel for 400+ watts of power.  It may be hard to match this with Hypex amp so you decide if it is worth it or not.',\n",
       " \" Schiit Vidar stereo amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Vidar costs US $699 and nicely comes with a five (5) year warranty.  With amplifiers being one of the most susceptible audio products to failure, long warranty is a real value.The Vidar sports the usual design style of Schiit which in this form factor is attractive:Despite its narrow width, the Vidar is quite heavy as it uses a linear power supply and class AB amplification topology.Back panel connectors are fine but I always miss balanced inputs in audio products:During power testing and such, the Vidar got fairly warm but not too hot and typical of the category.  It only shut down once when I ran a sweep causing it to clip at 20 kHz.I only tested the unit in stereo mode and not bridged.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone delivering 5 watts into 4 ohm load:We see the typical power supply noise spikes to the left and right of our tone.  SINAD (measure of noise and distortion) is dominated by second harmonic distortion though which rises to -80 dB or so in the worse channel.  As it is, performance is a few notches above average of some 85 amplifiers tested to date:Signal to noise ratio and crosstalk follow the same ranking:Frequency response is excellent though:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important aspect of an amplifier is amount of power it can deliver cleanly.  Let's start with 4 ohm load:We are getting 183 watts which is a bit shy of the 200 watt specification.  But that is at higher distortion.  If we allow that, we get there as well:Unlike class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, class AB amps like Vidar have much higher peak performance for short duration as you see above right.Using 8 ohm load we actually beat the company spec:Finally, the difficult test of power versus distortion versus frequency:Nice to see these lines without any strange curves and overlap.  This indicates there are no hidden dragons in the design of Vidar, just a standard degradation with frequency.ConclusionsSeems that Schiit set up to design a straightforward Class AB amplifier with lots of powers and no design flaws.  In that regard, it succeeds.  You have an attractive amplifier with long warranty and lots of power into 4 ohm load.  At US $699, it is priced well.Overall, I am happy to recommend the Schiit Vidar.\",\n",
       " ' Parasound 2125 V.2 power amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $899.The 2125 has an understated look with just a few touches to keep it from looking boring. The only controls in front are for which set of speakers it drives.  There is more however in the back:For those of you wanting to use it with a sub, it has selectable high pass filter of 20 or 40 Hz.  Trigger is supported as well as bridging.Parasound 2125 V.2 MeasurementsI had a heck of a time getting stable ratings in the dashboard with channel 1 mostly going nuts on its own. I thought this was a grounding problem so tried many things.  There was hardly a difference.  It was not until the power measurements that I realized something is going on the amp in the 5 to 20 watt range.  Anyway, here is our dashboard when both channels were behaving:Measured noise+distortion lands the 2125 above average ranking:Noise performance is not great at 5 watts but naturally improves at full power:Multitone reflect the average distortion rating:Frequency response is very good:I was however surprised that gain dropped when I activated the high-pass filters.As noted, my first power sweep had instability in mid power.  I thought this was instrumentation error so I filtered the heck out of it and got these:On reflection though this was amplifier instability as we can see when I sweep the frequency:There is a frequency dependent hump in distortion which is very strange.  It is likely due to some kind of voltage rail switching.There is a lot of power available though in a cool running case:ConclusionsThis kind of performance would usually garner my recommendation for the 2125. On reflection though, I am worried about increased distortion in the \"sweet\" area of power band -- 5 to 20 watts.  Company needs to work on mitigating this issue.  So for now, I won\\'t be recommending the Parasound 2125 even though it checks many boxes from value to functionaltiy.',\n",
       " \" Class D Audio (the company) CDA-250C Power (speaker) Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The CDA-250C costs USD $495 from the company direct which barely sneaks it into affordable class.There is not a whole lot to look at on the face of the unit:As you see, the unit is made in USA.  I suspect the case is generic Chinese though given the DIY look and feel it has.The power button is oddly in the right side of the unit.The back panel sports very large speaker jacks which is nice:Unfortunately there are no balanced inputs even though the holes seem to be made for them.Another miss is lack of any safety or regulatory certification.In testing, the CDA-250C ran completely cool.  I could not feel slightest rise in temperature of the case whether I touched the top, left or right, which is really good.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard at 5 watts of output:I was pleased to see the unit working well enough to allow me to measure it down to DC and hence the DC offset.  Many recent switching amplifiers make my analyzer go crazy if I DC couple of it.SINAD (signal over distortion and noise) is rather low and seems to be driven by high noise floor than distortion products (which are below 100 dB).Signal to noise ratio is disappointing:We can't even clear the CD's 96 dB at either 5 watt.  We barely get there with 200 watts of output (which is already pretty distorted).The news gets pretty ugly when I measured THD+N versus frequency at six different power levels:We have multiple problems here.  At both low and high end of the frequency spectrum we have rising noise and or distortion.  The higher the power, the worse they get.At low power outputs (around 1 to 2 watts), low frequency noise seems to escalate which may be due to power supply noise.To top it all, two channel are wildly different than each other.  One seems to be a lot more susceptible to noise than the other.Let's look at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone with wide bandwidth and see if we can figure this out:I should have run this without my external filter but let's run with it anyway.  We see our usual spikes in hundreds of kilohertz due to switching frequencies.  But we also see a rise in noise around 50 kHz or so.  The previous test uses 90 kHz bandwidth so this peak will impact the measurements.  Note again the channel mismatch.Let's rerun the previous test, this time by limiting the bandwidth to 22.4 kHz.  Note that this means that we can't capture anything past second harmonic for the high frequencies (hence the reason the levels artificially drop there):The graph becomes somewhat cleaner especially at low output level (in red).  But otherwise, the signature issues with distortion/noise remain.Let's run our typical power versus distortion test.  Note that 1 kHz tone is used for this test so doesn't incorporate the issues we see above:We have good bit of power reaching 178 watts into 4 ohm before clipping sets in. FYI, I have refined this test to give us more resolution near max power so it is a bit unfair to previous products I tested.  Still, this is quite a bit more power than the two reference amps in the graph.When I get a chance later, I will test the output impedance versus frequency.  And a frequency response test which I just realized I forgot to run too.  ConclusionsGetting nearly 200 watts/channel into 4 ohm for a US made power amplifier for $500 is not bad.  Outside of that, you have to close your eyes to many flaws.  These noise and distortion issues way dwarf anything upstream.  As such, I don't see the Class D Audio CDA-250C in any kind of high fidelity system.  Our search will continue for something with Hypex NC400 performance but at half the price.Needless to say, I can't recommend the CDA-250C but you can judge it for yourself and your application based on above data and decide.\",\n",
       " ' 3e Audio SY-DAP2002 stereo desktop DSP amplifier with Bluetooth.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  I will also do a teardown and test with upgraded op-amps.  I went to look up the price just now and it says no longer available!  I think it was US 116.The enclosure is heftier than is typical for the class:A cute set of white LEDs rotate around the volume control when first turned on and then indicate volume level.   An unusual twist for this class of amplifier is inclusion of mains power supply:No figure-8 power cord was included however so I have to supply my own.  As you see, there is a little fan to help with cooling but it never came on during my testing.  I had the top open and touching the heatsinks showed that they were pretty cool which explains the fan staying off.Note that while there is a DSP subsystem, I did not test it.  It is based on \"Sigma\" ADAU1701 platform which I already reviewed. Amplification is provided using the ST Micro TPA3255 chip.SY-DAP2002 MeasurementsI started my testing using stock configuration:Distortion is quite low at -95 dB however SINAD is way worse at just 72 dB indicating noise as the limiting factor (SINAD is sum of noise+distortion relative to signal).  Don\\'t be confused by the -100 dB noise floor in FFT.  That is after some 35 dB of \"FFT gain.\"  The owner had warned me about the noise and indeed had gone ahead and purchased the recommended upgrade opamps, the LM 4562.  I took the top off and swapped both and performance indeed improved:Noise still dominates though so performance continues to be average:You can see the effect of noise in SNR tests:Here is the comparison of noise with no input signal with or without the op-amp upgrade:Frequency response is limited based on digitization and load dependency:Crosstalk was generally good but somewhat variable:Multitone test shows how low the distortion is, alas with high noise floor:Healthy amount of power is available before shut down:Because of aggressive protection circuit, I could not get to 1% THD to measure max or peak power.Good bit of power is available at 8 ohm indicating that the 4 ohm performance above is current limited:Transfer function is quite good for a switching amplifier:SY-DAP2002 TeardownOverall construction seems reasonably clean:Top row is the switching power supply which naturally has high-voltage rectified mains in it.  As such, I would have liked to see a routed slot in addition to existing isolation that exists on the PCB.  That would reduce the chances of arcing from high voltage side to the low voltage amplifier.Capacitors are lower grade as usual but at least all the ones I looked at are higher grade 105 degree C.  The heatsink is quite beefy for its size and seemed to do its job keeping the TPA3255 chip amp cool in my testing.  I am not sure the fan will do any good since it likely pushes air in but there are no vents to push air out.  High static pressure then reduces its effectiveness although likely it is better than nothing (if noise is not a problem).I did not like the Bluetooth antenna lead travelling from the front of the board to the mains side.  The noise from switching power supply may reduce Bluetooth range and at any rate, it is not a safe place for it should the lead come off and touch the high-voltage areas of the power supply.  The RCA cables could have been moved a bit up (in the picture) and made room available for that in the low voltage section.I see no regulatory and safety certifications which is not good in mains powered gear.Overall, this is not nearly as bad as it could be.  ConclusionsGetting a DSP platform and top-flight chip amp and power supply in a small box takes good bit of effort.  Overall, this is not a bad platform but compromises are there with performance dropping below what the chip amp can do.  Personally I use DSP upstream so have no use for it in the amp in this configuration so the performance hit (if due to that) is not good in my book.  But you can decide otherwise.I could have recommended the amp but seeing how I had to upgrade the op-amp to get good performance, I am going to pass.',\n",
       " \" Rotel RB-1070 stereo power amplifier. It was released in early 2000. Can't find the cost then but I see it used for around $400 to $500.I have always found Rotels to be most attractively designed power amplifiers.  One look at that front panel and you immediately think of muscle and beauty in design.  Alas, the extruded aluminum in front which gives it that look, is cosmetic.  There are two others internally which do the job of cooling this classic AB design.  In use the heastsinks got pretty warm to touch to give it some air to breath.Not much news in the back other than nice inclusion of trigger input/output:Rotel RB-1070 MeasurementsThe unit warmed up nicely without its performance changing much:So let's see what our dashboard of 1 kHz tone does into 4 ohm load:The amp is about 2 dB more sensitive than usual which likely accentuates the power supply noise a bit.  I was able to reduce 60 Hz hum in one channel but not simultaneously in the other.  That is exceeded however by the power supply noise at 120 Hz and multiples.  SINAD is likely dominated by distortion to the tune of -80 dB.  This lands the RB-1070 slightly above average of all amplifiers tested:Despite the power supply noise, dynamic range is very good:Frequency response is excellent and spec compliant:Crosstalk is good:Multitone shows no frequency dependence which is nice:There is ample power available into 4 ohm:The response is quite odd in that it doesn't slope down.  Don't know if that is intentional, accidental or due to power supply caps aging, letting in more ripple as power goes up.Regardless, lots of power is available:Company only specs the power into 8 ohm at 130 watts.  It certainly delivers that:Putting aside noise floor which is rather high, the units transfer function is one of the best I have ever seen:Sadly there is a significant power on pop:ConclusionsAs one of my favorite (looking) brands, I was very anxious to measure a Rotel amp, hoping it would not let me down.  Fortunately it did not.  No, the SINAD doesn't break new ground but the rest of the measurements are very good with plenty of power available.  It is a great choice for people wanting good amount of power in an attractive package with competent performance.I am going to recommend (used) Rotel RB-1070.\",\n",
       " \" Outlaw Model 5000 five channel home theater amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  Despite the number of channels and power of each, the Model 5000 costs only US $649 though shipping adds fair bit to it.The shipping is expensive because this is thing is super heavy.  It is at the limit of what I can reasonably carry upstairs to my lab (50 pounds):My back nearly got killed just rotating the darn thing in my photo booth:Sadly, as you see, there are no balanced XLR inputs.  You are given heavy binding posts though which is nice.Left and right channels are far apart which is the right away to do it as they, and the center channel get beat the most.  And is most logical layout in my book.In use the Model 5000 never complained, shut down or anything of the sort.  The heatsinks are below the top cover so you can't exactly feel their temps.  I would imagine it would shut down though if it got too hot.Not much else to talk about so let's get into the measurements.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Nice to see the gain at 29 dB which is the only recommended standard in the wild (from THX).There is fair amount of mains hum and power supply noise.  I improved them a bit with messing with grounding but this is the nature of the beast when a linear power supply is used.Distortion is dominated by second harmonic which combined with noise and hum gives us a middle or the road SINAD:Speaking of noise, there is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and near full power:I like to see 96 dB or better at 5 watts to clear the dynamic range of the CD but we don't get there.  At full power though, we meet that target and a bit more in the good channel.Frequency response is basically flat in the audible band:Testing with my simulated speaker model did not change the response hardly at all:Crosstalk was good as it should be in modular amplifiers like this with independent amps:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important deal with any amplifier is its power versus distortion and noise so let's start with 8 ohm load:Nice to see the Outlaw 5000 completely outclass our NAD AVR both in much lower noise, distortion and available power.  The picture is almost the same with 4 ohm load although distortion rises:These are two channel tests.  Adding two more 4 ohm loads power drops a bit naturally:That is over 800 watts delivered into the load which is great.Back to two channel power, here is what we get with short bust (simulating what you may get in music) and more steady state -- both at 1% THD+N:The toughest test I run is power versus frequency while trying to achieve 0.1% THD+N. The amp has to deliver its output while being stressed the entire 3 to 4 minutes the test runs.  Many AVRs quit.  Not so with Outlaw 5000:As you see, it not only passed the 2 channel test, but also 4 channel.  A quick statistical analysis of my high-res music library shows highest peaks at 40 Hz and that is where the cursor is.  We are getting 252 watts at that frequency with two channels and 207 watts with four channels.  Yes, it is lower than 1 kHz peak I use in other graphs but still a lot of power.ConclusionsDespite its bargain price, the Outlaw Model 5000 is solidly built and delivers tons of power without complaining.  It provides a clear setup over the built-in amplifiers in home theater AVRs.  No, it doesn't deliver state of the art distortion and noise.  For that, you will have to pay a lot more money.  For what it is, it is very good and I am happy to recommend the Outlaw Model 5000.\",\n",
       " ' Douk Audio H7 stereo class D desktop amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs US $144.Right away we see differentiation in the form of the nice looking VU meter.  Not only that there is a control to set it sensitivity which is a must in my view. The backlight is nice and bright and goes well with that yellow/orange ring.  The case is machined aluminum so feels nice and heavy for its size.  The switches and controls are surprisingly robust and impart a feeling of quality.  In other words, this is in entirely different class compared to typical budget desktop amplifiers.  Surprised continue to the back side:Yes, we have real, full size XLR inputs!  Of course there is also RCA input but they also added a set of RCA outs.  I am assuming that is to connect subs and out but there is no internal filtering.The heart of the unit is TI\\'s TPA3255 single chip stereo class D amplifier with very lofty specs:Wide input range is provided. Included power supply is manageable with 32 volts output with 5 amps of current.  If you are going to drive higher impedance speakers and you want to go louder, you may want to up that to 48 volts.One negative which actually follows some \"high-end\" gear is dual volume controls.  Yes, to increase or lower the volume, you have to crank both of them. I would have wanted to see a single volume control with a balance knob.  As is, you can set them once and use an upstream DAC with its volume control (and remote).  That is how I tested it by setting the gain to 29 dB and treating it as a power amplifier.  You can see the position of the volume controls in the picture for that gain setting.Douk Audio H7 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm load using XLR input:The SINAD of the good channel at 82 dB is above average for all amplifiers tested.  But for some reason the other channel (in blue) is distorting more which drags the average down some:Zooming in:Noise performance is quite good for class although short of the TI specs:As is typical of budget class D amplifiers, the frequency response varies with what load (speaker) you connect to it in treble region:This means you may hear brighter or softer sound depending on exact impedance of the speaker. Best to use EQ and tailor that to taste.Distortion is kept very low at 5 watts:The less good channel lost 1 bit here (not shown).  So still quite good and more than enough for the application.Crosstalk is very good for any amplifier let alone a budget one:Let\\'s see how it does in power department starting with 4 ohm load:This is good bit of power and only gets better if we allow 1% THD:I ran this three times as I could not believe it breaking into 3 digit department!  200 watts out of this little box?  Granted, the test is short term but still, that is quite healthy.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally get less power:Note that most speakers are around 4 ohm in bass frequencies where most of the volume is so don\\'t go optimizing for this unless you know you have an 8 ohm speaker in that region.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of a DIY combination of ICEpower 200AC and 200ASC in a Ghent audio case.  It was kindly supplied by a local member.  Total part cost is US $310.The case work is fine:I like the hefty power switch which also acts as protection circuit indicator.  Speaking of that, it is of nice variety that self-resets and doesn't require manual power cycling.The back panel sports far better connectors than you could get in any mass market amplifier:And of course balanced inputs.The internal amplification for one channel is provided by the ICEPower 200ASC which has an integrated switchmode power supply.  This in turn feeds power to the amplifier-only 200AC module.  Nice and clever!ICEpower 200AC MeasurementsLet's run our usual dashboard into 4 ohm:Having been spoiled by high performance class D amplifiers, this is somewhat of a letdown.  Distortion is dominated by third harmonic at around -78 dB which sets SINAD to the same rating.  Result is average performance among all amplifiers measured to date:Signal to noise ratio is good though:Frequency response is as well:Power into 4 ohm though show early rise of distortion:Disappointing to see performance be worse than some of the worst AVRs we have measured at the limit.  Same is true at 8 ohm:Even when we allow distortion to rise to 1%, we still don't get the rated 200 watt power:The power supply is the limiting factor likely.Sweeping the power range at different frequencies gives us very complex response:The lines going backward are caused by the amplifier going into temporary shutdown.  This is occurring at just 40 or so watts at 20 kHz!  Fortunately there is not much music power there but still, from engineering point of view, I like to see far cleaner and stable response.  In some cases SINAD is rising to below 50 dB at just 2 watts!ConclusionsAs usual, we have high efficiency and compact packaging of class D amplification here.  What we don't have is performance that matches or beats good class D amplifiers.  Of course the cost is much lower as well (compared to higher performance class D amps).  So you have a trade off to make.  I am too much of a perfectionist to want to recommend this unit but depending on what you are using it for, it may be fine.\",\n",
       " ' Emotiva BasX series A-500 five channel home theater amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The A-500 costs US $529 which seems reasonable given the functionality and ratings.I can\\'t say that I find the A-500 attractive but is not ugly either:Here is the connectivity which sadly does not include balanced XLR connections:This is a Class AB amplifier with a rather larger toroidal transformer.  It is not overly heavy though which my back appreciated.The heatsinks end well below the top of the case so it was hard to judge how warm it got by touching the case.  A quick test with IR temperature sensor showed the heatsinks running around 50 degrees C.In use the A-500 never complained, shut down or go into thermal protection.  This is nice benefit over the delicate amplifiers in AVRs which if you look at them wrong, they go into protection/shut down.  Clearly this is much more robust solution.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts output:I was surprised by two things: large channel disparity with respect to distortion (SINAD) and very high mains hum at 60 Hz.  No amount of playing with grounding fixed the latter which tells me the 60 Hz is probably induced from the transformer into the amplifier section.  The former, channel distortion parity varied with which channel you used.  Channels 1, 2 and 4 were very close and good.  Channels 3 and 5 lagged way behind.  The \"good channels\" had their SINAD actually dominated by that mains hum and power supply noise, not distortion (red channel).   The situation was reversed for the \"bad channels.\"Averaging all the channels we get a middle of the road score:Signal to noise ratio reflected the above issue with a-weighting resulting in substantial improvement of SNR:Our threshold of heaving in low frequencies is quite high so this is not as big of a problem audibly as it is in measurements.Frequency response was very good, almost ruler flat in audible band and going beyond 100 kHz at -3 dB:Crosstalk between channels 1 and 4 were rather disappointing:It is closer to a $29 amplifier than our state of the art Benchmark AHB2.The meat of the review is power measurements versus distortion.  So let\\'s get into that at 8 ohms:Nice to see the massive improvement relative to a higher end AVR (NAD T758) but as soon as distortion takes over, that advantage is sadly lost.  We do get a few more watts though than our AVR.Here is the same measurement with 4 ohm load:Let\\'s sweep from 20 kHz to 20 Hz and see how much power we get with THD+N set to 0.1% (barely or not audible distortion):We see a small drop in power at the extremes which is good.Some of you have been demanding that I work harder and measure performance with more than two channels.  So here you go:I could not get the amplifier to distort less than 0.1% with 4 channels regardless of output level. So I stepped that up to 0.2% to get the third graph.  I could have been watching a movie instead of running these extra tests so I hope you are happy!ConclusionsThe Emotiva BasX A-500 seems to be a decent shot at building a 5 channel amplifier for a very decent price.  Yes, it is a bit of a gamble how good each channel is, and how audible that mains hum can become.  Other than that, it is a definite step up very amplifiers in AVRs.Overall I can recommend the A-500 if you are on a budget and have a bad back stopping you from lifting something heavier.',\n",
       " 'This is a review and abbreviated measurements of the Linn Majik DS-1 integrated streamer and amplification.  It is on kind loan from a member.  It has been discontinued but back in 2010 (?) when it was announced it was US $4,200.  I see a recent ebay sale for a bit over $1,000.The Linn is an attractive unit:The interesting bits are in the back:You have full suite of analog and digital inputs although given the age, USB input is lacking.  Roon remote is built into the networking which is very nice for an older device.  And of course you have full amplification in there for a single box solution.Streamer DAC Stereo MeasurementsSince there is line out, let\\'s use the Toslink input into its DAC and measure what comes out before the power amplifier:By today\\'s standard, this is definitely subpar with sum of distortion and noise relative to signal not close enough to beat the CD format:I tested streaming with Roon player and performance was identical which is good.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started testing the power amplifier by using the Toslink optical input first:We see sum total SINAD of 78 dB.  This obviously is NOT limited by the DAC as it produced 20 dB better performance.  Indeed switching to analog input we see that confirmed:As its, the DS-1 lies smack in the middle of rankings of all the amplifiers we have tested regardless of price (nearly 120):I quickly ran a frequency response test using analog input and was quite surprised that it was not flat:Thinking it may be digitized, I switched to digital input with both 44.1 kHz and 96 kHz sampling:We see the same curve.  So unless there is some kind of EQ I don\\'t know about, it is sad to see such roll off.Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm:This is very little power for all but secondary use.  It naturally drops lower with 8 ohm load:And these are not \"good watts\" either given how early distortion takes over and flattens the curve and then swings up at clipping.ConclusionsIn 2010 this kind of functionality would have been advanced.  But today there are a range of streaming solutions with amps that retail in hundreds of dollars with much more power.  It is disappointing to see an engineering focused company like Linn target so low in power and noise and distortion.Anyway, even at $1000 I can\\'t recommend the Linn Majik DS-1.  That said, if you have one using it in a secondary location like bedroom, office, etc. would be fine.',\n",
       " ' Behringer A800 Class D Stereo Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The A800 costs US $299 including free shipping from multiple sites.The member who loaned it me has done a youtube video of it which you can see by clicking on this link.Behringer has been in this game for a long time and it shows from high level of optimization of weight, size and robustness of the A800:The unit is quite shallow relative to its width. Standard gain controls are provided which go up to 30 dB (for balanced input).  Nice set of LEDs show the output level including clipping indicators.  All amplifiers should come with such displays (with switch to turn them off).  I could do without the notches in the volume control though as they are fake (they are fully analog) and made exact setting harder (it would creep into the notch).  Not a big deal though.Back panel shows nice set of connectivity:For my testing I focused on XLR input only and standard speaker banana connectors.The amp hardly radiates any heat and has no fan.  Given the pro application of these amps, I expect them to be robust and reliable.During measurements, the A800 provides high level of predictability and assuredness that I sometimes miss when testing switching amplifiers.  It only shut down once after fair bit of experimentation at full power.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a gain of 29 dB to deliver 5 watts into 4 ohm load:This performance is very close to the Behringer A500 which I reviewed before.   That amp though, generated much worse SINAD because of its non-switching power supply:Its distortion products are capped to -80 dB which is what we see in A800.   Eliminating those power supply components sharply improves SINAD which is relative to sum of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is \"OK:\"Don\\'t use it on sensitive speakers you may hear some hiss (although turning down the gain may help some).32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows early rise in distortion with frequency:Crosstalk is reasonable:Dual, 19+20 kHz tone shows very high level of intermodulation distortion as we saw in multitone test:Fortunately your music doesn\\'t have such high amplitude tones and threshold of hearing is high that I don\\'t think this is nearly as much of a problem for the ear as it is for the eye.Frequency Response MeasurementsThe necessary low pass filter is causing some peaking at 20 kHz to the tune of 0.5 dB:The above is with a resistive load.  I have been asked frequently how the amp performs with a real speaker.  Stereophile uses a simulated load of a 2-way speaker that was given to them by NHT.  I built a similar load based on schematic from Doug Self:Here is the impedance of my load versus frequency:My response is more damped in low frequency than what Doug Self and Stereophile show.  I will investigate this further but for now, it is close enough.  Here is the phase response:And Stereophile graph of the two:Using my simulated load this is what I get with A800 amplifier:As you see, there is hardly any difference.  Looking at stereophile graphs, they use highly zoomed version to show differences.  This is what happens when I do the same:So a bit of ringing becomes apparent but it is so small as to not be of any consequence.  Heaven knows your speakers are not anywhere close to this level of variation.I will test some of the other amplifiers I have with this load and see if it causes more variation.  As it is, resistive load is the same as complex one.Note that neither my load, nor stereophile\\'s are high power ones.  So I cannot plot full power graphs and such.  Above measurements were at 5 watts.Amplifier Power MeasurementsGoing back to our resistive load, we get this output with 4 ohms:The show starts well with A800 being much quieter than our premium brand NAD AVR.  But then distortion kicks in and we don\\'t do as well.  We get however tons of power nearly a quarter of a kilowatt.  Similar story holds for 8 ohm load:Still, that is a lot of power at 8 ohm leaving our AVR way back in the dust.Using 1% threshold for THD+N, we get more power naturally than my graphs above indicate:Left hand is short-term burst power, right side is long term.Thermal StabilityPerformance improved just a bit after 10 minutes of warm up at 5 watts:So you don\\'t have to leave it on for good performance.ConclusionsThe Behringer A800 does what pro amps try to do: provide solid, middle-of-the-road distortion and noise with tons of power in quiet and light package for little money.  The design is stable and better than the A500.  As such, I can recommend the A800 as an everyday amplifier.',\n",
       " \" Wyred4Sound mINT integrated stereo amplifier and DAC.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,499 from the company.  I see reviews dating back to 2013 so the box has been around for a while.The design goes with the rest of Wyred4Sound gear although in person looks less refined than I expect in this price range:The back panel shows some very good functionality such as triggers and home theater pass through:The overall package is small and convenient from that point of view.  It ran reasonably cool which was also nice.As I took this picture, I realized USB only goes up to 96 kHz which is the old school USB interfaces of the time.  Fortunately it is asynchronous which was novel at the time and could have been worse in the form of synchronous USB.Wyred4Sound mINT MeasurementsWhen I first powered on the unit, the measurements were low so to make sure it was not my setup, I took the time to route all cables separately tightened all the connections and performance seemingly improved.  But this morning I got up and thought maybe the box was warming up and changes had nothing to do with the wires so ran my standard warm-up test:Looks like my guess was correct.  The amp did not stabilize even after 7 minutes of running with load on.  I waited at least that long before I took the measurements you see below so represents the warmer side of things.  With amplifiers with both digital and analog inputs, I always have to determine which input is best which depends on topology of the amp.  So let's do that here, first using Aux In analog input:I tried hard to suppress that mains noise at 60 Hz but every change made it worse.  I then switched to USB input:Man, this is bad.  It should be a walk in the park to have  DAC that keeps up with an amp that has a SINAD of 77 dB but here we are, with one of the worst performances I have seen with digital input.  So let's continue with analog input for the rest of the tests starting with our SINAD rating:So below average and disappointing.  Even more disappointing is the high noise floor:Crosstalk is fine:Frequency response unfortunately shows variability which means the class D amp used doesn't use a feedback loop outside of its filter to remove that dependency:Assuming you have good high frequency sensitivity, this amplifier will sound different with different speakers.We see that distortion sets in early and rises a lot:Here is our peak and max power at 1% THD:Sweeping different frequencies shows reasonable response for a class D but not in general:ConclusionsI very much like the functionality of the mINT with cute small size.  Performance though is subpart and much better can be done than what we have here with discrete parts which may cost even less than this combo.So I can't recommend the Wyred4Sound mINT.  But if you are fond of the functionality, I am not going to chase you out of the room .\",\n",
       " \" Jeff Rowland 535 stereo (bridgeable) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  I believe it costs US $5,900.If you are not familiar with Jeff Rowland, it is a high-end audio company, known for their gorgeous machining of their cases that imparts a 3-D look.  You can see that coming through the protective film which I chose to leave on:The unit is incredibly heavy for its small size.  The back panel shows the most unusual binding posts I have seen:Those big knobs rotate to tighten bar on two spade terminals.  The feel incredibly nice.  Alas, they don't mate with banana leads and I had to screw around to connect mine.The amplifier is said to be balanced throughout including input transformer which is made with wire from Cardas (!).  Company only states that a switching power supply is used but says nothing about the rest of the functionality.  From my testing, it seems to be class D which would explain why the amp stayed completely cool to touch under testing as if it was never on!  The massive chunk of chassis aluminum is likely responsible for great thermal performance.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz dashboard at 5 watts into 4 ohm:Ah, this is disappointing.  Distortion peaks to -80 dB which sets SINAD at an average number of 77:This is way below stated of the art in switching amplifier design.  Company specs are similar by the way so this is representative performance as designed.Where specs don't match is in signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk curve usually gets worse with frequency (due to increased effect of stray capacitance) but here it is rather flat:Frequency response is very good with no indication of interaction with the load:Another shortfall from the spec is in power department:Letting distortion peak up to 1% still doesn't give us what the spec says:I don't know how they get to 500 watts unless it is at even higher distortion levels.As a way of comparison, let's see how the power curve looks like relative to noise and distortion of Hypex based NC400:We have slightly more power although the NC400 I tested had a shared power supply.  That aside, there is no comparison in noise and distortion department.  The 535 way underperforms the Hypex.Finally, here is an unfiltered output of the amplifier at 5 watts:We clearly see the switching waveform.  Attenuation is better than 30 dB which is more than a number of other amps I have tested so that is good.ConclusionsThe Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier has beautiful fit and finish.  And is solidly engineered to run cool and I am sure reliable as a result.  It produces good bit of power which should be able to drive many speakers to desired loudness.  Alas, it reinvents the wheel and makes it less round.  Any amplifier based on Hypex modules will have as much or more power with far less noise and distortion and lower cost.Bottom line, I can't recommend the Jeff Rowland 535 due to its high cost and average noise and distortion.\",\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio TB10D stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and is only sale for US $70 on Amazon including shipping.We have the typical compact desktop aluminum case. Controls feel nice for the class.  Tone controls are not centered however for flat response (you can see in the picture what I set them to). Typical of these budget amplifiers, power is provided externally through a switching supply:Binding posts are spaced out a bit more which made it easier for me to plug in my large cables.This is a class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 single chip amplifier.Fosi Audio TB10D MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watts measurement of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:Dominant distortion is third harmonic which essentially sets SINAD to same level. This is slightly below average but considering the price of this amp, it is reasonable:Kind of interesting that the $5,900 Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier lands almost next to it!Signal to noise ratio is modest but again, good for the class:Crosstalk holds its own against much more expensive amplifiers:Frequency response is variable due to bass and treble control and load dependency:The load dependency is the norm in this class.  Hopefully some amp comes along and with no cost penalty takes care of that (by incorporating the output filter into the feedback loop).Distortion rises with frequency which we can see in multitone test:Power is everything in amplifiers so let\\'s see how much we have:This is quite healthy for such a small and low cost amplifier!  It gets even better if we allow 1% distortion:We are talking essentially 200 watts coming out of this little box!  Cost per watt is just 35 cents.  Amazing.Even with 8 ohm load we get good amount of juice:Amplifier \"transfer function\" (output vs input) is very good for class D although it does show rise in distortion as noted earlier:Of note, you still have 66 watts of power at 20 Hz.  Many budget amps drop to 20 or so watts which can be problem as bass is what requires power.ConclusionsMaybe one day this will change for for now, in under $100 range you can\\'t expect perfection in performance of a stereo amplifier.  What you do want to see is delivering healthy amount of power with close to our average of all of our amplifiers tested to date.  On that front, the Fosi Audio TB10D delivers. If you need an amplifier for secondary use (bedroom, workshop, etc.), the TB10D is a very good candidate for no more money than one or two dinners!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio TB10D amplifier.',\n",

Here they are spaced apart which essentially solved that problem. Inclusion of an AC power supply is unheard of in this price class and nicely declutters your desk.Oddly the USB input is type A.  At first I thought this was for external storage but manual talks about using this with a computer.  I didn't have a type A to type A cable so didn't test this and stuck with Aux analog input.The heart of the unit is Infineon MA12070 class D amplifier.SMSL A100 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Distortion is actually better than 90 dB but there is rising level of noise and high order spikes which drag it down to 76 dB.  This puts is slightly below average:\",\n",

Not a fan of the figure 8 AC mains cable as I have very few of them.  Best to not lose it.There is a fan on top but I did not hear it come on.  The unit does get quite warm though so allow ample cooling/space above it.Emotiva BasX A-100 MeasurementsAnother member had contacted me asking me if I could test if the unit was distorted while cold.  I had stopped testing for this since the warm up effect has been so minimal.  Not so here:You see what I am seeing?  12 dB improvement in distortion after 5 minutes???  I am assuming bias is not optimal while cold but why? Temperature compensation is quite cheap and has been part of design of amplifiers forever.Anyway, here is our usual dashboard:Not happy about the channel gain difference.  As it is, performance is a bit below average:I like to see a dynamic range at 5 watt approaching 96 dB and we are fair bit short of that:Frequency response is flat enough:Crosstalk is pretty good for a budget amp:Here is the multitone:Power versus distortion+noise is good:If we allow 1% THD, we get the power spec from the company:Distortion characteristic has a simple relationship with frequency and that is it:ConclusionI really like the packaging and price of this amplifier.  While overall performance is good, having to wait 6 minutes before it stabilizes is just not acceptable.  I would be tempted to buy this and mod it to make it temperature stable.As is, I can't recommend the Emotiva BasX A-100 amplifier.\",\n",

It is on kind from a European member and costs €369.I have a soft spot for white audio electronics and the SA1 goes right after that!  Quite elegant. What I didn\\'t like is the lack of indication on the file LEDs which indicate inputs. The volume control is digital (also controlled via an included remote). Pushing it selects the input.  The LEDs also blink for other reasons I did not try to figure out. Here is the  back panel:It was odd to see just a type A USB that is indicated as USB power.  There should be proper USB input in this day and age. There is pre-out but in my testing, I found that the volume control did not adjust it when using digital input but did with phono. Maybe this was operator error, I don\\'t know as only a single half-sheet of instructions is provided with the unit.The unit as shipped is for 50 Hz/250 volt so I used my lab AC generator to power it.  Specifications say \"40 watts\" of power so thought my 300 VA lab supply is enough.  As it turns out, it was not.  See the measurement section.FYI, there is a very clos cousin of this unit from NAD in the form of AMP1. I could not find either for sale in US.  The AMP1 lacks Bluetooth I believe but has Chromecast built in (?).  It is not clear who built this unit.  Likely it is an OEM for both.Argon SA1 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit Toslink and measured from the pre-out.  The output was severely clipped.  So I brought the input level down -12 dB to our nominal 2 volts and no clipping:This lands the unit in the middle of our \"fair\" category:I like to see a SINAD of over 100 dB for this class product and we are good few dBs short here. Here is the response sweep of digital input levels:Our dynamic range is just \"OK:\"At this point, the picture of the DAC performance is clear so I thought I cut to the chase and measure the amplifier.Argon SA1 Amplifier MeasurementsWith amplifiers that have both analog input and digital, I start by testing both to see which is more transparent and run with that.  Here is analog input:This is not a happy picture with rising low frequency noise and distortion that is just below -80 dB.  Let\\'s try Toslink input:Ah, that is much better.  The combination of noise and distortion is well above average now:So let\\'s continue with Toslink input starting with our SNR:We are a few dBs short of my 96 dB requirement for 5 watts but 88 dB is not so bad. I expected crosstalk to be better given the digital input:Frequency response shows some load dependency in this Class D amplifier but better than many with this problem:Let\\'s see how much power we have starting with 4 ohm load:Multitone performance is good:I could not get to clipping range as my AC lab supply would shut down.  So likely there is more power to be had as you can see in this dynamic test:I did have enough juice to run the 8 ohm test:In both cases the SA1 beats the ARCAM AVR10 in noise which is good.Argon SA1 Phono MeasurementsThere was tremendous amount of mains interference in the phono stage dashboard.  I am not going to show that as it may be due to use of my lab supply.  But here is the all important RIAA equalization:It seems to be a little heavy handed in upper bass with a rumble filter built-in.  Not bad but not perfect either.ConclusionsI really like the way the SA1 looks.  But looks can\\'t get me over \"checklist\" DAC performance of around 16 bits.  The analog input on the amp doesn\\'t perform well but digital does.  Overall I have mixed feelings on the unit so not going to pass judgement one way or the other.

At that price, it seems like an incredible value.I have to say, while the unit looks industrial/military, it does not at all feel cheap.  As expected it comes in 19 inch rack mount configuration but very shallow:Not only do you get a high power amplifier with front graphical display and such, but also a built-in DSP.  It is not a fancy subsystem but allows you to dial in crossovers and such which is very handy in live sound.   At may company (Madrona Digital) we use a ton of Crown amps not for hifi applications but for music distribution in the home.  The built-in DSPs come in handy for limiting the frequency range, max output, etc..Unlike home units, the XLS 1502 has a built-in fan with tons of holes for ventilation as you see.  Fortunately it is temperature controlled and barely came on during my nearly 50 watt soak time.  And when it came on, it was very quiet.Here are the guts of the unit (click on the image for larger size):Man, is this clean!  Look at the beefy mains chokes to keep noise at bay.  The power supply is integrated on the same board as the power amplifier so you can\\'t swap one to fix the unit although at these prices, getting a new unit is more economical anyway.  The fan is placed not only in front of the heatsinks for the power transistors but also the output filter inductors which is nice as far as keeping them cool too.I noticed that the output stage is depopulated.  Seems then that the step up model just has a few more parts in it and that is that:There are tons of connectors in the back which I let you read about elsewhere.  Overall, this is jaw droppingly nice unit and unbelievable at the price that is being charged.I did a lot of searching and was surprised that there were no measurements of these units.  A lot of empty reviews, yes.  But no measurements.  So you get to have an exclusive set of data in this review!    So let\\'s get into that.MeasurementsI started by cooking the unit for a while at 48 watts with kind permission from its owner:Unlike some other amps, bringing the unit up to temp ever so slightly worsens performance.  There are also some interesting thermal effects from time to time represented by the spikes.  Anyone who thinks they can predict what thousands of components do as they warm up should get into predicting the weather on tuesday next week, 10 years from now!  Anyway, let\\'s look at our dashboard at 5 watts of output:Sorry I did not set the reference in the FFT.  But the news is there in the SINAD (signal over distortion and noise) of just 75 dB.  We have seen worse but also much, much better.  Gain is about 30 dB by the way.Signal to noise ratio is decent but again, nothing high-end about it:Let\\'s look at power versus distortion+noise:So we see that the Crown XLS 1502 easily outperforms the no-name Chinese class D amp we recently tested (IRAUD350).  It has a well behaved response with sloping down curve and then onset of clipping.  Power was around 336 watts @ 0.008% distortion.  I say \"around\" as there are not enough points in these measurements to find the exact onset of clipping.  The number is therefore a bit understated.  Crown specs the unit at 525 watts though at 4 ohm and we are not going to get there without a lot of distortion.The hypex Hyped DIY Nc400 amplifier far outperforms the XLS 1502.  It has far lower noise and distortion although not as much power before clipping.  It costs nearly four times as much though.I thought I do a comparison against the Behringer A500.  The A500 feels a lot more cheaply made but is also priced at $199:We see that the Crown XLS 1502 is better in every regard with lower noise and much more usable power before clipping.I thought the continuous power would be a walk in the part for the XLS 1502 but did present a surprise:The red \"thermal\" light came on the front panel but instead of shutting down, the power was reduced a bit.  \"The show must go on\" seems to be the rule here and nice to see instead of full shutdown we saw with Hypex Nc400.   As you see, I let the unit keep going and it went to 8+ minute maintaining that status.Frequency response was surprising but easily explainable:We have a \"brickwall\" style filter which indicates our analog input is digitized first through an ADC running at 48 kHz sampling, processed through DSP (or not), and then converted back to analog before amplification. Both the ADC and DAC therefore sharply limit the bandwidth to 48 kHz.  I was surprised to see some roll off at 20 Hz too.Wideband FFT (without AES filter) as usual shows a lot of activity in higher frequencies:The first peak is very nicely truncated at a little less than 100 kHz to pass emissions standards (by 60 dB).  Crown class I devices interleave the output stages which would explain the energy spread over four quadrants at multiples of that ~100 kHz pulses.  Since the XLS 1502 has passed emissions standards I would not worry too much about them.ConclusionsIt is hard to fathom that a properly engineered and produced mainstream brand amplifier with so much power can be sold for so little money.  This is a robust but bargain amplifier designed for heavy punishment in live sound.  Can it be used for hi-fi use?  Sure but it will severely limit both the resolution and potentially bandwidth of upstream sources.  Its best use would be as a subwoofer amplifier.  If you need an all in one unit, Hypex NC400/NC500 designs are so far my choice among amplifiers tested.',\n",
       " ' Outlaw Model 7140, seven (7) channel home theater power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 7140 seems to have come out a few years ago and is shown as discontinued.  At the time it was out, the cost was a reasonable US $1,100.  The new replacement series, 7000X looks just like this so not sure what they have changed.The 7140 is a beast of an amplifier, nearly breaking my back carrying it up to my lab:The design is highly modular with a massive toroidal transformer powering 7 independent amplifiers, each with their own power supply on board.  The heatsinks are rather beefy with plenty of distance between them and top of the unit.  The feet are also quite tall allowing better ventilation from bottom to top.The back panel shows the inclusion of XLR inputs which I appreciate:The inclusion of a grounding terminal was interesting.   It did no good in my testing with XLR inputs as it should not.During use, the 7140 was quite stable, never complaining, shutting down or anything as Audio/Video Receivers (AVRs) tend to do.  Clearly then this is a more robust solution than internal amps in those units.Power Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard view of 5 watts into 4 ohm load using a 1 kHz tone:I was surprised to see such high mains hum at 60 Hz.  A prior review of another unit with just RCAs complained about the same thing and recommended a ground terminal on the unit which they have added.  But as I mentioned, it made no difference.  I have to think this is magnetically coupled into the amplifiers.Fortunately or unfortunately the distortion spike from 2nd harmonic is bit higher still so didn\\'t impact measured SINAD (combination of noise and distortion relative to our main tone).  As it is, the 7140 lands below the average for all the amplifiers we have reviewed so far:Frequency response is flat enough:32-tone signal to resemble \"music\" shows the typical rise of distortion with frequency:And rather high noise floor which could be caused by that power supply hum.Here are the noise figures for 5 watt and full power:We are not clearly more than 14 bits or so at 5 watts so not very quiet.Here is our power versus distortion and noise at 8 ohm:We see the elevated noise and distortion relative to our reference amplifier.  Power produced is right on the money at 146 watts.Here is the same at 4 ohm:The above tests are at 1 kHz.  Here is what happens when we sweep the frequencies, aiming to measure power at 1% THD+NQuite a drop in power with both loads when we get down to 20 Hz.  The power supply capacitors are likely too small to keep up with the slow rate of change at low frequencies.We see a similar view when we look at sweeps at different frequencies:Finally, some people like to see intermodulation distortion of 19 + 20 kHz tones so here it is at max power:ConclusionsThe Outlaw Model 7140 has a very sturdy build.  It produces good power per specifications provided from manufacturer (at least in two channels).  The down side is too much ground/mains leakage and distortion+noise that is slightly below average.  Paying more (a lot more actually) will get you sharp reduction of such problems.For typical home theater duty, the 7140 should do the job fine.  It just isn\\'t something to get excited about from pure performance point of view.',\n",
       " \" Sound Town ST-UPDM4C four (4) channel professional amplifier. It was purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me. It costs US $540.As you see, there is a bit of style to this amp with the front panel.  This is a straight amplifier with no DSP:The fans came on immediately and made moderate amount of noise (much quieter/lower pitched than many small fans like this).  As you see, input is XLR and output is speakon connectors.I was very pleased to see Audio Precision analyzer graphs in the manual.  They were quite tiny and hard to read but made me hope that the design was verified through such.Sound Town ST-UPDM4C MeasurementsThe tests you see are all performed using Channels 1 & 2 on one side.  Let's start with our dashboard:SINAD is below average of all amplifiers tested by 4 dB but for a Pro amplifier, it is not bad:But there is more going on here.  There is broad set of noise between 2 and 4 kHz.  I shut off the signal feed to it and was very surprised to find this noise component:Seems like some square wave with harmonics buzzing around internally that is bleeding into the amplifier.  Not good.That noise limited the signal to noise ratio:It also showed up in multitone test:Notice how the ends of the spectrum has reduced levels which indicates non-flat frequency response:Not only do we have (speaker) load impedance dependency but we are missing the lows as well below 40 Hz or so.  As such, you can't use this amplifier for subwoofer duty.Amplifier is rated at huge wattage so I was shocked to see so little output with 4 ohm load:I am used to seeing power exaggeration in pro amplifier specs but this is in entirely different class.Strangely, I got identical amount of power into 8 ohm load:Is there some kind of limiter in the unit?  There must be.  See what happens when I change frequencies:See how the curve goes up but then starts to go backward below 1 kHz?  That is electronic limiter in action.  Finally crosstalk was very poor:ConclusionI have hardly seen any audio device show issues in every test I run but here we are.  I don't understand what is going on here.  How can they have analyzed the performance using AP yet have so many issues left on the table?  Did they design change post those measurements?  This is the frequency response from the manual:It shows flat response to 20 Hz.  Notice the date is 2003.  Is it really that old of a design?Anyway, I can't recommend the Sound Town ST-UPDM4C. \",\n",
       " ' PS Audio Sprout100 integrated DAC, headphone and power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Sprout100 is an upgrade over the original Sprout and costs USD $599.I remember the first time I saw the Sprout at an audio show.  I thought it was utterly cute!  It is small and handsome little package with a ton of functionality:As you see, in addition to functions I mentioned, it even has Bluetooth included.  And moving magnet turntable input.  It is a dream product for a frustrated marketing guy in a high-end audio company like PS Audio, wanting mass market product that appeals to the \"younger audience.\" The volume control is a rotary encoder with a built-in switch that powers the unit on and off.  If you hold the button down, the LED color changes from purple to white, indicating bass boost is on.  The rotary encoder is poorly programmed to have linear and slow response, making it very, very slow to change volume.  To go from low to high volume you may have to turn it seven or eight times!  We live in a digital age with music that is fast to access and comes at all levels.  Having the ability to quickly change volume is important.Input selection is old school mechanical selector.  I like the clear labels.The backside shows how much is crammed in there:I did not test sub out but it has sensor that automatically activates that output (and rolls off the mains?).In addition to USB input, we also have toslink optical which is nice in case of ground loops.The nicest bit is included power supply in such a small package.  Kudos for managing to fit that in there and reduce clutter.There is protection circuit for both power amplifier and headphone.  During testing I found it to frequently activate which simply turns off the unit.  It caused a lot of head scratching until I discovered the latter action.It is also I think underdesigned from cooling perspective.  When I started my DAC testing, I had the dummy load connected to the unit as well.  After a few minutes of testing I noticed the signal went away.  Then I realized per above it had shut down.  Went to touch the power button and it was hot as heck.  As was the rest of the enclosure which was super hot.  Even the top \"wood\" panel was hot to touch.   I would not rely on the 100 watt rating into 4 ohm to be a continuous rating for any length of time.The Sprout100 is rated at 100 watts into 4 ohm and according to PS Audio uses ICEPower modules.I should tell you that I hate testing multi-function devices like this.   Every subsystem takes as much time as reviewing another product with just that functionality.  In the interest of getting the review done, I did not bother to test the Vinyl input.  I also did not touch the sub out or toslink.DAC MeasurementsThe inclusion of line out allows us to test the DAC subsystem independently so let\\'s start with our dashboard there:The output was variable so I adjusted it to 2 volt.  Per my review notes above, the power amplifier was on and was whaling away into the dummy load at the same time.PS Audio rates Sprout100 as having less than 0.01% THD+N distortion from line out.  We are beating that although that is such a low bar.  Equivalent rating in SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) puts the Sprout100 in our bottom quarter of DACs reviewed:Not a good place to be although probably fits the performance target they created for themselves for \"lifestyle product\" like this.Back to our THD+N rating, we can separate the components of distortion and noise and get this ratio:They are both contributing to the final THD+N but the noise is a bit more dominant.  Likely in this small enclosure the could not get enough isolation for the DAC subsystem to reduce noise levels.The high noise level makes the jitter graph \"pretty\" with almost no spikes visible but that is because the noise floor is so elevated:Best in class DACs put that noise floor down to the bottom of the graph.Same noise problem manifests itself hugely in linearity test:That smooth, exponential rise indicates random noise polluting the voltage reading at each level.  Noise-free performance then stops around 80 dB or 13 bits -- quit a bit shy of 16 bit performance of CD.  In this day and age, I like any DAC to at least do justice to CD format, bringing fully transparency to 96 dB.Intermodulation test shows similar higher noise floor but also pretty early rising of distortion levels:Similar story for THD+N versus frequency:Dynamic range of the DAC is as spec\\'d:Speaker Amplifier MeasurementsNote: all amplifier testing except when noted, is with an AUX-0040 Audio Precision filter in place to reduce high frequency components given the fact that this is a switching amplifier design.As usual, for amplifiers I test with 5 watt output.  The trick is to know what to use for input level and volume control.  With digital input that was easy as I set the level to 0 dBFS.  But then I thought we want to know the performance of the amp alone so we better test with analog input and here is what I got:With digital input I could get over 80 dB by the way.  But no combination of input and volume level could get us there with analog input.  In some sense then the amplifier is good enough for the performance of the DAC.Frequency response showed different response in each channel:I swapped my loads and the curve did not change, indicating that the variation is due to the amplifier (filter) design, not differences in my loads.  Clearly the channel in blue is resonating around 50 kHz, causing that large boost of nearly 20 dB!  What you get with your speaker load and its wiring is unknown.  The red channel is more behaved.  We saw the same discrepancy between channels in the SINAD in the dashboard.Poking our noise into the design using high-bandwidth spectrum (FFT) analysis, we see this:Note that this is a raw test with the external filter removed.  We clearly see the switching frequency around 600 kHz peaking up to almost -20 dB.  You can have your own AM station if you like.    We have an early rise in noise before 100 kHz which is due to some kind of noise shaping.  There are a lot of other spikes which one could examine to see what is going on but I am too lazy to do so.  Regardless, these amplifiers are not pretty to look at as far as performance above audible band.  It is the price you pay for having 100 watt/channel amplifier squeezed into a little box.Speaking of power, let\\'s measure that into 4 ohm load:We get 82 watts with both channels driven which is shy of the 100 watt specification.  Noise and distortion is lower than Topping TP60 ($200) amplifier.  And there is more power.Signal to noise ratio is \"OK\":Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s jump right in with power versus distortion and noise at 300 ohms:We have competent level of power but much more noise and distortion than our reference Topping DX3 Pro ($220 when not on sale).  I like to see at least 100 milliwatts here and the Sprout100 delivers.Here is the picture at 33 ohm:We have 420 milliwatts of power until the Sprout100 shuts down causing the graph to shoot back to the left.  In other words, the unit is distortionless until it shuts down.Output impedance is a bit high at 5.7 ohms:Headphone Listening TestI started my testing with Sennheiser HD-650.  There was enough power there for a very good experience.  I could not detect any onset of distortion.Switching to Hifiman HE-400i, I got a bit more power and again, clarity and power until the end.Dedicated headphone amplifiers will produce more power but there was enough here with either headphone to give a bit of tingling to my ear lobes during bass so I was happy.  I could not get the Sprout100 to shut down with the HE-400i so in practice this may not be a serious problem.ConclusionThe reviews I read prior to testing the Sprout100 all point to how great it is that a \"high-end\" company like PS Audio has produced such a mass market product.  And that this association must be translating into excellent sound.  Our objective measurements show that this is not the case.  Performance of such subsystem as the DAC and headphone amplifier is nothing to write home about. Subjective aspects though are good: lots of power from the headphone amp and to some extent, from the power amplifier.The miss from usability is the super slow to change volume control.  In many cases I could move it a notch and nothing would happen to the output in my analyzer let alone the ears.So where do we land?  From objective performance I can\\'t say that the Sprout100 lives up to the promise of the brand.  From full functionality point of view at $599 it seems to be there though although I have yet to test many products in this category.  For this reason, I am going to withhold giving or holding back a recommendation.  Let the data guide you in that regard.',\n",
       " \" Crown XLS 1002 rack mounted pro amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  The 1002 costs US $339 including Prime shipping from Amazon.Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman and hence Crown products.  We use fair bit of Crown amps in custom installs usually to power in-ceiling speakers and such.  Member wanted to buy it through us but the margin on it was no more than a cup of coffee (relative to online sites) so I suggested he buy it elsewhere which he did.Not sure what to say about the look other than it is made to have some style while being rugged:The LCD with bluish backlight reminds me of displays on electronics back in 1980s.  I guess at this price they had to cut every penny.I was relieved to see binding posts besides speakon connectors:Now don't laugh but I could not figure out how to pull out the safety plugs they put in the darn binding posts!  There is no way to grab then and I did not want to put a mark on them by using a sharp tool.  The manual says only European units have it but clearly that is not correct.  Anyway, I resorted to using the SpeakOn connectors for my testing.  For input I focused on XLR inputs.I set the gain to max to get the nominal 29 dB I have standardized on for testing amplifiers.There is a fan in the back and some inside.  But none came on that I could hear above the sound of my PC during testing.  Nothing shut down even when the amp was pushed into clipping.  Some kind of limiter would kick in after short period to keep the power level at max.  Temperature of the case didn't even rise above room temp.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsPerformance was stable during a 5 minute warm up time so I ran with them:Strange to see higher order harmonics dominating the distortion profile (FFT to the right).  Ratio of noise+distortion to signal as expressed in SINAD is what I expect decent pro amps to produce:Slightly below the average of all amps tested.Signal to noise ratio is in the same range:Crosstalk is reasonable:Frequency response test shows that everything is digitized due to inclusion of DSP functionality in this amp:Power into 4 ohm is healthy as is the case with most pro amps:I was disappointed to see one channel be much worse than the other though.Letting distortion go higher we get higher power output:The burst/peak power is not higher because of the limiter I mentioned in the intro.Using 8 ohm load gives a more behaved response than 4:This indicates the one channel is starving for current than the other (likely longer path to the power supply).I was unhappy to see distortion shoot up at higher frequencies:Fortunately in practice there is not much energy up there so you will be operating in low wattage area where distortion is quite a bit lower.Finally, I removed my AES filter to get the spectrum:Switching frequency is around 380 kHz and decently attenuated.ConclusionsCompetent pro amplifiers target for good enough noise and distortion.  The Crown XLS 1002 falls in that category so if you were expecting to have anything better for so little money and so much power, you would be disappointed.  But otherwise the amp does what it targets to do.I am going to put the Crown XLS1002 on my recommended list for non-critical applications or for driving subwoofers and such.\",\n",
       " ' Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 Stereo Class D power amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $799 (recent price increase).The GaN 5 comes in a compact enclosure with plenty of ventilation at the cost of decent looks:Beside the sole power button and blue indicator, there are two red LEDs that turn on when you power the unit on and then go off.  Strangely, when the amplifier goes into protection, they do not light up and getting the unit working again requires a power cycle.  I like to see protection circuits that self recover when the extreme condition goes away.The back panel shows binding posts that are too close together for easy fitment of my large banana speaker cables.  But I like the inclusion of balanced XLR inputs:As you see, there are also jumpers to change the gain setting although the range is not very large (26, 28 and 32).  Most of my testing was with medium gain which is as shipped.I had trouble getting the amplifier to function initially.  It would simply not output anything.  I played with grounding as I have seen some very low end amps cause AP to not be able to capture their output due to high level of noise (despite my use of AES-17 filter).  This didn\\'t work at first so I switched inputs to RCA.  That did not work either.  After some fiddling and switching back to balanced input, the amp all of a sudden started to work.  Not sure how much of this is interaction with Audio Precision or design issue.  Either way, it is an exception to the rule of 95% of amplifiers I have measured.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses the new Gallium Nitride transistors (GaN) which has some advantages over classic Mosfet transistors.  All else being equal, it can produce higher efficiency and better performance at expense of higher cost.Mini GaN 5 MeasurementsAs noted, I started my testing in medium gain which produced near nominal 29 dB which is my standard for amplifiers.  XLR input was used per introduction:Well, this is disappointing.  Distortion is fairly high causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion+noise to be worse than a number of budget desktop amplifiers:Noise performance by itself is not good either:I had trouble getting the amplifier to go to full power for the right graph.  It would shut down at just 0.7 volt input. Strangely, later on it accepted higher levels of input.  I think the impulse nature of this measurement was causing it trouble.  So maybe it can produce higher SNR at higher power but still, none of this is competitive.On the other hand, crosstalk was very good:Multitone performance was also reasonable:What is not reasonable is high dependence on speaker load when it comes to frequency response:This is just not proper.  Clearly the output filter is interacting with the load.Power measurements were quite puzzling:Notice the pull back due to some protection kicking in, likely the power supply rather than the amplifier.  I could not remotely get the power rating they specify using medium gain.  I thought maybe low gain does better but then the pull back occurred at even low power (blue and green)!  Beside lack of power, distortion is also quite high for this price class and category.  We are talking about poor Audio/Video Receiver amplifier performance!Switching to 8 ohm tamed the output a bit but power shortfall is still significant:This being the second amplifier I have recently tested with such power shortfall, I started to doubt my instrumentation.  So I pulled out my Purifi reference design and measured it.  It tracked the dashed line in the above graph from a year ago 100%.  Someone had posted this from their website:600 watts per channel??? Into 8 ohm?  This is the spec from the manual:How on earth did they measure 600 watts when the spec is 200 watts?  Strangely, that graph is nowhere to be found on their site.  There is some talk about a larger amplifier of which is a shrunk version?  Maybe that is the one that produced higher power but why does it say \"mini\" in the title of above graph?FYI, this amplifier has the green board which I understand to be the newer design.  Maybe the older red one had more power.  Hard to say.Anyway, I tried to run my max and burst power:In Burst mode, the amplifier would keep going into pull back and so I could not compute anything for that.  Likewise the THD+N vs frequency and power could not be run.  As the frequencies got lower and lower, the point where the amp would pull back would also shrink to lower and lower wattages.   What I could get did not show great transfer function.ConclusionsWhile I leave the door ever so slightly ajar to some interaction with Audio Precision, the measurements seem to indicate an amplifier that has both design issues and inability to meet specifications.  The fact that the company took away the only measurement graph makes it suspect that maybe they had have modified the design and selling something different than what they originally intended.  As it is, it is a waste of GaN technology as it brings nothing to the party but high expense.I can\\'t recommend the Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 amplifier.',\n",
       " ' \"upgraded\" TPA3221 chip based AIYIMA A05 integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $80 from Amazon including Prime shipping.For a budget amplifier, the controls feel nice:As you see, tone controls are provided.  Alas, there is no detent or switch for flat response.  If you center them, you actually get too much bass.  I had to adjust them using iterative measurements to settings you see in the picture above for flat response (see measurements later in this review).A giant external power supply providing 32 volts is included which dwarfs the size of the unit itself:I dislike these little speaker terminals but they are very common in this price class.  They are too close to each other to connect beefy locking banana connectors I use for testing.Bluetooth is provided which I did not test.In use, the unit never even got warm so efficiency must be quite high.  Or else, the heat is not transmitted to the case.AIYIMA A05 MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:SINAD is dominated by distortion and ranks below average of all the amplifiers tested to date:Still, for this price and category, I think this is pretty good.Signal to noise ratio becomes good at full power:Crosstalk is decent as well:Here is our frequency response with my adjustments of the tone control:As you see we get a typical peaking of the response when I change impedance to 8 ohm.  This is due to the filter in the class D amplifier interacting with the load.  Fortunately you have tone controls here so you can compensate for it.Multitone shows best performance in mid frequencies which is a good thing compared to the alternative:Let\\'s see how much power the A05 can produce into 4 ohm load:This is much more than I expected.  We get decent amount of power even with 8 ohm:Above is with 1 kHz.  Let\\'s see how it does when we vary that:Not pretty at either high frequencies or very low.  As noted, mid frequencies do well which is good as that is where we are most sensitive.  ConclusionsGetting decent amount of power and low distortion and noise is hard in ultra low price category but the AIYIMA A05 gets there.  So I decided to grade it on a curve and give it my recommendation.',\n",
       " ' Monoprice 150 watt \"605030\" rack mountable \"pro\" stereo amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing.  The 605030 costs just US $119 from Amazon including Prime shipping which is remarkably low.From a distance the unit looks like any other pro, R1U amplifier:It looks rather cheap an unattractive to me but hard to imagine any pro amp getting some kind of design award for their looks.Two gain controls are provided in the front which I appreciated.  For testing I aspire for gain of 29 dB and I almost got there at max level as shown.  That is how I tested the unit.  There overload indicators which was niceWhat I did not like one bit was the rather loud fan which runs continuously.  Monoprice, please take another $5 from me and make the fan temperature dependent please!Seeing balanced input in any amplifier at $115 price range is incredible but that is what we have here:Output is provided in the form of SpeakOn and mono 1/4 inch sockets.  Neither is convenient for in-home use but you can deal with it as I did.The loud fan did have one benefit: the amp never changed temps above the room after all my tests.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI powered on the unit and ran the dashboard and was immediately disappointed with the very high distortion:I checked all of my connections and distortion persisted.  I almost didn\\'t run the rest of my tests but decided to do anyway.  As another 5 to 10 minutes passed, I noticed the performance had improved so I went back and re-measured the dashboard again:I have never seen an amplifier improve by 11 dB after brief warm up.  Some kind of thermal compensation is left out to save money I guess.  If the fan was not running, you could leave it running all the time but with the fan, I certainly would not.  Anyway, the ranking is still below average but at least not in the broken category:Frequency response shows anomalies in the filtering of the switching design:Depending on your speaker and its impedance, you may get accentuated highs.  There is also low frequency roll off which indicates likely capacitor coupling.Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about:Crosstalk is kind of average:Power versus distortion and noise into 4 ohm load shows unacceptable rise at higher power levels:We get the rated power and no more:Into 8 ohm performance is rather strange:Weird to see that smooth and gradual rise in distortion as if not much feedback is used.Sweeps versus different frequencies indicates the same issue as distortion rises with frequency:Finally, without my AES filter, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:Pretty ugly but levels are low and of course well above our hearing.ConclusionsThe cheap looks, loud fan, and lack of power for a pro amp was enough for me to dislike the Monoprice 605030.  Then I wondered what else you could get for so little money and there is nothing that comes close.  Hell, if this doesn\\'t work as an amp, you would get your money\\'s worth in the form of chassis, power supply, etc!Personally, I am too much of an equipment elitist to want to buy this amp.  I would pay more to get a quiet unit, with more power and slightly better looks.  But you all can decide as you want.',\n",
       " \" Starke Sound AD4.320 four channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member new and drop shipped to me.  It costs US $1,499 but they have had sales with prices as low as US $900.The Ad4.320 looks a bit industrial and is quite heavy for a class D amplifier:The reason for heavy weight is dual linear transformers and power supply on the right side.  Usually class D amplifiers use switching power supplies which keeps the unit light.  My own switching amplifier also uses a linear power supply with its weight and size penalty.I was pleased to see balanced inputs and triggers for remote on and off:As you can see, you can bridge two channels together and get double the power.  Unlike other amps that require funky connections, you have two dedicated terminals with a slide switch to select the mode (which need to be activated when power is off).  When I powered on the unit, I could not get output out of one channel.  I switched the bridge mode left and right (when off) and it got both working.  For bulk of my testing I tested channels 1 and 2.Starke Sound AD4.320 MeasurementsWe start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a load of 4 ohm with power of 5 watts:Gain is atypically low at 21 dB (usually it is in 28 to 32 dB).  Not a problem with our dedicated DACs as they can easily provide the voltage the unit needs.  Sadly we have high 2nd and 3rd harmonics that cause SINAD to droop down to 73 dB. This is well below average of all amplifiers tested:We are talking chip-amp performance level here not anything that would come at this price range.Signal to noise ratio is better but not exciting:Multitone test shows rapid rise in distortion with frequency:The class D amplifier filter is not inside the feedback loop so shows high sensitivity to load:This means the tonality you get may depend on the actual impedance of the speaker you use.  Crosstalk between channels 1 and 2 is very good:Key performance metric for any amplifier is powered and I was very surprised to see far less power than specified:We are not even in the same planet with 104 watts vs spec  of 320!  I switched channel 2 to 3 just in case there is a power supply limit but it almost made no difference.  We are still way short of the company specs:Story repeated with 8 ohm load:Forgetting about lack of power, we also have very early rise in distortion and rising before clipping.I thought maybe they had used peak power to rate the amplifier but that is not in the same vicinity either:We do see the benefit of the linear amplifier in the way it allows higher burst power than tightly regulated switching power supplies.Sweeping the frequency and measuring power and THD+N, shows smooth lines which is good but they are quite elevated at higher frequencies:ConclusionsThe AD4.320 underperforms in so many categories.  You can argue about audibility of this and that measurements but not the lack of power. That, you will hear.  Is the unit broken?  Could be but it doesn't perform like it is broken.  I thought maybe it is set to 240 volts but it is clearly marked as being a 120 volt unit (see the back panel picture).  And at any rate, if they shipped the amp this way to a US customer, then that is what they are going to get.I can't recommend the Starke Audio AD4.320.  Getting four channels with so much power would have been a good value if they had delivered.  But when they don't, there is no reason to buy it.\",\n",
       " ' Emotiva XPA HC-1 Monoblock amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $879.As the name indicates, this is a single channel power amplifier. I have a soft spot for monoblocks and the HC-1 hits it. I especially like the power button which has buttery action and nice orange color when you hit it. Alas, then it switches to the cold, trademark blue color of Emotiva. Wish they would switch to that orange!Note that the amplifier is *very* deep, probably three times as deep as it is high.  Back panel shows nice inclusion of XLR input which is what I used for testing:The design of the amplifier is Class AB with dual power supply rails in order to keep power consumption low at lower powers. It did that as the amplifier barely generated any heat during my testing.  I was not a fan of the protection circuit though as when it clicked in (during 20 kHz sweep), it required power switch in the back to be toggled.  I like self-resetting protection circuits and if that is not possible, have the front panel be used for that purpose.If you are not familiar with my amplifier measurements, I highly suggest watching this video on amplifier measurements.Emotiva HC-1 Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard using XLR input:My eye quickly went to the high distortion products which sadly lands the HC-1 at well below average of all amplifiers tested:Even though SINAD is distortion dominated above, noise performance at 5 watts is not anything to write home about either:I like to see an amplifier above budget prices to clear 16 bit hurdle of 96 dB at 5 watts.  Or else, sensitive speakers may spit out noise.Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and good bandwidth:Multitone test patter shines a familiar light on the amplifier when it comes to distortion:In an attempt to have more common measurements with other sites, I decided to run the 19+20 kHz intermodulation distortion (although I don\\'t know what power others use):Spray of intermodulation products around our dual tones don\\'t paint a pretty picture.Let\\'s run our power sweeps:We do have a lot of power but alas, that comes at the expensive of noise+distortion.  Allowing for 1% THD distortion, we do get a lot of power:Rail switching design (\"Class H\") shows distinct change in performance as that happens:Notice how distortion is lowest around our 1 kHz testing and increased when you go lower or higher in frequency.  The latter is kind of expected but not the lower.ConclusionsThe Emotiva brand is one of budget prices but with high performance.  Alas, after testing many of their products, the right message here is budget prices with slightly below average performance.  Company really needs to retool their products and bring up the objective performance up a notch or two.  Then they will have a winning formula.  As is, we see products like HC-1 here which underperform more than half the amplifiers ever tested (over 400).  Fortunately it is very powerful so likely sounds OK.I can\\'t recommend the Emotiva XPS HC-1 amplifier.  It is an OK amp but we are not here for OK products.',\n",
       " ' Rega IO stereo integrated amplifier with phono input.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $649 on Amazon including Prime shipping.  It is designed and built in UK and price there seems much more reasonable (379 pounds).The front panel doesn\\'t do much for me:It is function though with a simple input switch and power.  The inclusion of remote control is a nice touch:Courtesy of the company heritage in building turntables, it has phono input built-in.  No digital inputs  which is an odd omission in this day and age.Rega IO Amplifier MeasurementsWith power amplifiers I let them run at about 5 watts into my 4 ohm load and watch their distortion+noise to see when it stabilizes.  It did not in the case of Regao IO and contrary to audiophile belief, kept getting worse!I watched every video review of this box while waiting but it would simply not stabilize.  At around 23:00 minute, I started to sense the smell of electronics running too hot so I put my hand on it.  That was a mistake as it darn near burned it!  The sides were quite hot.  I took an IR picture of it:As you see the left and right bars run much hotter with the back end being at around 45 degrees C.  This is in open air in cool weather where we live.  Imagine what it would do at higher power delivery and when put in a cabinet.  Not good.  Company provides lifetime warranty but says it won\\'t include wear and tear.  Wonder if it cooks itself whether they repair it under warranty.Anyway, let\\'s get on with our testing starting with our dashboard:A lot of things stand out.  For starters, the channel gain is not matched.  The mismatch seemed to be volume pot independent.  Then there is the matter of very high levels of mains hum and harmonics.  No matter what I did with grounding, it would not make any difference whatsoever.   The mains noise is actually higher in energy than the harmonics.  That is not a bad thing in that our sensitivity at lower frequencies is much lower than at higher ups.SINAD sums all the noise and distortion and lands the IO in the \"fair\" category:This is well below average of nearly 79 dB.Signal to noise ratio as a result is nothing to write home about:I was surprised that despite being a simple class AB design, it doesn\\'t have flat response in audible band:Most shocking measurement was that of crosstalk:Here is our multitone test showing the impact of distortion:Company specs the amp at just 30 watts into 8 ohm and good news is that it delivers that:But this is not much power.  Here is what we get into 4 ohm:Thankfully being a class AB amplifier with unregulated power supply, it does better in burst mode:Modern speakers are built in compact enclosure that reduces their efficiency greatly.  I am not sure this is enough power.Here is our frequency stepped response:Class AB designs sport clean transfer functions and the Rega is no exception.  Typical of all amps though, you lose power at very low frequencies.  Usually you have a lot to loosing some is not super painful.  Here though, you don\\'t so that is not good news.Phono Stage MeasurementsThere is no preamp output so I decided to use the headphone output to measure the RIAA equalization:Good showing here assuming you prefer less bass to LP rumble.Headphone Output MeasurementsCompany specifies the headphone output as having an impedance of > 100 ohm which is massive.  It will cause frequency response error in vast number of headphones which have variable impedance.  And on those flat ones which tend to be low, it will dissipate a lot of power internally:This is basically a checklist feature and not something that you want to use for any serious headphone listening.ConclusionsI have a soft spot for western companies trying to compete with Asian ones in budget audio products.  Alas, performance has to be there to do the job and for the most part, it is not with Rega IO.  Capability is poor as far as power output.  Measurements like crosstalk are horrid.  Headphone output is years behind times with super high impedance.  And then we have the large amount of heat this generates.  If this were a powerful amplifier I could understand idling high but not when all you have is 30 watts into 8 ohm.  Amplifiers have a tough life and you want them to be reliable.  I am not sure how long the IO will last given the elevated temps under which it operates.I don\\'t know that this is a terrible amplifier but when test after test makes me cringe, I have no choice but to withhold recommendation for Rega IO.',\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A300 stereo amplifier with balanced and Bluetooth inputs. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $177.I like that you can easily defeat the tone controls now and select one of three inputs, allowing the amp to replace a pre-amplifier as well.Especially nice is inclusion of power supply which is a rarity in budget/small amps:The speaker terminals are small but typical for the price class.I could see an aluminum heatsink in the box for the power device/IC.  In use though, it never warmed up above room temp.  Neither the top, or the bottom registered a temperature rise which is nice.AIYIMA A300 MeasurementsLet's start with unbalanced RCA input first, setting the gain to 29 dB as with other amps I test with adjustable gain:Switching to balanced we essentially get the same performance:That distortion spike at nearly -72 dB limits SINAD to below average:In fairness and comparison to a few amplifiers with much lower gain, I also tested the amp at 12 dB gain:A bit better but still not enough to cross the average line.  For the rest of the tests, I stuck with XLR input and 29 dB gain.Here is our SNR:These are disappointing numbers relative to what AIYIMA has shown it can do.Multitone test result is not too bad:Crosstalk is good:Frequency response unfortunately shows load dependency:Key here is to see if we can get more power out of this small package and we do:Interestingly, we get almost as much with 8 ohm load!Back to 4 ohm load, with short bursts we get a lot more power:Finally, there is little frequency/power dependency which is very good for a class D amplifier:Warm Up Time MeasurementAmplifier stabilizes quickly:ConclusionsIt would have been great if the A300 had followed the footsteps of previous AIYIMA amps but with more power.  Alas, it delivers on more power at the expense of noise and distortion.  Assuming you don't hear the noise, it may be the right trade off in a budget amplifier.  On packaging, I really like the integrated box with XLR inputs.  Amplifier power supplies can be huge and that is avoided here. I am personally snobbish and want my power with low noise and distortion so can't recommend the AIYIMA A300.  But your priorities may be different.\",\n",
       " ' Crown XLS2502 DriveCore (switching) 2-channel amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The XLS 2502 cost US $645 including free shipping from Amazon.  It has DSP functionality which I did not test.  And is specified to drive 2 ohm load.From the outside, the XLS2502 is built like a tank:It is very light of course due to switching topology for the amplifier and power supply.  But also very sturdy with plenty of steel to keep its shape.The two gain controls are notched which gives them a nice feeling but the gain is not matched and is hard to get there using those notches.Here is the back connectivity:There is a fan as you see but in normal testing it never came up. During stress testing, it did come on but was pretty quiet compared to what I expected.  Mind you, I don\\'t think you want it close to you if it is going to be running.Alas, the fan was insufficient to keep the unit cool under full power.  The red thermal indicators came up even though the fan was running.  The amp seemed to be functioning still but to be on the safe side, I terminated my testing there.  In typical home use, even for subwoofer duty, I doubt that this is a concern as you will see later as far as what wattage we are talking about.Overall, the impression of the amplifier is positive, making you think you have something made to be run over by a car and still function reliably.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:I set the gain to 29 dB for consistency.  I also tested it at 19 dB gain and it only made 1 to 2 dB improvement.  The reason is that SINAD (signal relative to noise+distortion) is dominated by harmonic distortion.  Here, those harmonics are very high order which perceptually is not very good as they are not masked as easily.  Anyway, with a SINAD of 71 dB, we have below average performance:The XLS1502 did a bit better in this regard, garnering a SINAD of 77 dB.Frequency response shows the same sharp cut off:I don\\'t know if this can be changed using DSP programming or not.Above is with resistive load.  Switching to a simulation of a 2-way speaker gets us little difference:So there is some speaker dependency but I would not lose sleep over it.Crosstalk is OK but could be better:The red line is a $30 amplifier by the way.32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" gives a more hopeful picture of distortion:The spray of harmonics is high in frequency where our hearing threshold is higher.Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts but gets better at full power:Lower gain settings may improve this a few dBs.Amplifier Power MeasurementsYou don\\'t buy this amplifier to listen at 5 watts so let\\'s see what it can do when its wings are given enough room to fly:Wow!  Nearly 500 watts of power is delivered into both channels simultaneously.  The good news doesn\\'t end there. Check out these ratings when distortion is relaxed to 1%:1600 watts of peak power is delivered out of standard 120 volt outlet!  These thing is a powerful beast.Noise level is decent but I wanted to make sure the high gain was not impacting it.  So I reduced gain to 19 dB which required some 6 volts of input to drive to clipping:There is no difference at all.For the rest of these tests I stayed at 19 dB gain.  Here is the power output with 8 ohm:Over 300 watts at what should be inaudible distortion for most people.Finally we get to my stress test.  I played with the settings because the high frequency noise shaping would not let me perform the sweep.  So I decided to change this test and set the limit to 22.4 kHz (instead of usual 90 kHz) and limit the sweep to 6 kHz.  That way, the third harmonic of 6 kHz (18 kHz) is still included in the computation.  No music has full power at high frequencies anyway so I don\\'t think we need to keep measuring to 20 kHz with respect to power.  Here is the output:As noted, the red warning lights came on as the sweep was going from right to left so I terminated the test.  Delivered output was about 520 watts which is still plenty but is naturally lower than 1 kHz which was in high 600s.ConclusionsThese pro amps have mastered the technique of delivering tons of power with distortion and noise kept under control.  Lack of power is the #1 reason an amplifier can sound bad.  Don\\'t care how good the SINAD is at 5 watt.  If you run out of power, you will hear distortion, lack of dynamics, etc.  So if you need the power, it is best to get it than to have less of it.  And on that front, the Crown XLS 2502 delivers tons of it, breaking all previous records for any amplifier I have tested.  The price is ridiculously low for the amount of power you get as well.Ideally, you would use more finessed amplifiers above bass frequencies and use the XLS 2502 to drive the subs.  But if not, the XLS2502 can deliver good performance.Overall, I am going to recommend the XLS 2502.',\n",

Parts Express is selling it for US $650 right now.The APA1200DSP has nicer look than typical pro amplifiers:The back is especially nice with the type of connectivity you need in a home system:Both analog and digital inputs are provided.  Ethernet input allows a nicely done web interface to be used from anywhere:There is a microphone I believe and ability to automatically calibrate the room response.  I did not use or dive into this functionality.There is a fan that came on when powered on but nicely powered down gradually and I did not hear it during operation.  When it runs it has a lower frequency and a bit less annoying than on pro amplifiers.There is a strange setting for 2 vs 4 ohm speaker load.  I set it to 4 since I tested it at 4 and 8 ohms.  Manual doesn't say exactly what this does.APA1200DSP Amplifier MeasurementsI set the gain to -10 dB which gave me the nominal 29 dB I look for and measured using XLR input:Switching to digital input showed essentially the same performance:This level of noise+distortion (SINAD) puts this amp way down in our rankings:Noise level was not very good either, using analog or digital input:Unit was stable on power up which is good:Crosstalk was decent:Multitone suffered from high noise floor and sporadic distortion spikes:Sadly frequency response is highly load dependent due to class D amp's output filter interacting:We also see sharp cut off due to internal processing being at low sampling rate.  Switching to digital input at 96 kHz sampling made no difference:The name indicates it produces 1200 watts.  Let's see what it can do into 4 om with both channels driven:The curve wiggles as protection circuit kicks in.  Prior to that, it produced 370 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% didn't do much better:Switching to 8 ohm naturally cut the power substantially:Stepping through the test frequency shows a number of odd behaviors:ConclusionsTypical of this class of amplifier, power specs are mostly imaginary.  Objective measurement of noise and distortion are also typical with little attention paid to minimize them.  So you are left with buying this for functionality not because it has any great implementation of class D amplification.I can't recommend the Dayton Audio APA1200DSP DSP based on its pure measured performance. \",\n",

It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $389 from the company direct.The Spark comes in a deep but otherwise small case:Nice to have dual inputs and volume control.   The rear of the amp is a bit unusual in placing the mains input between the connectors:Would have thought to put the IEC jack all the way to the left and speaker to the right.  Doesn't matter if the performance is good anyway.Is this the first audio product we have tested from Serbia?Vista Audio Spark MeasurementsI had to crank the volume all the way up to get close to my nominal 29 dB gain (per THX spec):Boy, that is a lot of power supply noise.  Playing with grounding reduced the spikes at 60 Hz a bit but did nothing to the harmonics which are caused by the internal power supply.  Even if that was low, the distortion spikes are not.  As a result, the amplifier rates quite low in our overall ranking:Signal to noise ratio is better than what we saw in the dashboard indicating the noise floor rises with power:I was surprised to see a bass roll off in this day and age where just about every amplifier is dc-coupled:Multitone shows a messy response with the lows polluted by the power supply and highs due to inadequate feedback:Crosstalk is below average:The amplifier is rated at only 20 watts but I was not able to get that:It did better actually with 8 ohm load indicating current delivery is its issue:Back to 4 ohm, if you allow more distortion or buRst the input, you do get a bit more power:Finally, there is fair bit of variability when we sweep frequencies:ConclusionsSometimes I really wonder what appeal such amplifiers have that attract buyers.  This amp has too little power to drive most speakers and has a lot of noise and distortion as well.  There must be some mystique about it that I don't understand.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Vista Audio Spark II amplifier.  I hope the designer sees these measurements and at least works to sharply reduce the power supply noise as that can't be anything good no matter what school you are from.\",\n",
       " ' Parasound Zamp V.3 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The version I have is a revision or two older than what Parasound builds (I think).  The latest version is being sold on Amazon for US $277 including Prime shipping.  Considering this is a brand name company and we have a class AB amplifier, this seems like a reasonable price.The Zamp V.3 comes in a tiny and rather cute, half-rack package:In addition to power button, you also have a headphone jack.  From the bit I have read, the output is just the amplifier with a resistor inline.  This means its output impedance is high (not good) and likely noisy as well.  I did not test it.The back panel exposes good bit of control not seen on \"normal\" hifi amplifiers:Parasound has a leg in two industries: the Custom Integration (CI) channel and hifi.  The former is for companies who install these amplifiers in hide-away places to for example power a couple of speakers for a bedroom TV.  The gain controls and such give flexibility to this kind of installation as does the small form factor (the amp could be hidden behind a flat panel TV.  Being part of this channel means that when the automation is redone in a home using it, these units are ripped out and put on sale at low prices.  I see this amp advertised for as little as $149 on ebay.I was shocked when I read that this amp was class AB and after I looked inside and saw a heavy and large pancake toroidal transformer.   How the heck did they put in inefficient class AB amp in there with no heatsinking that was visible?  The answer came to me after I let the unit warm up for a little over 5 minutes at 5 watts being output from each channel.  The amp went dead and displayed a thermal overload!  It can\\'t produce just 10 watts for five minutes?  No, it can\\'t. I touched the bottom of the amp and it nearly burned my hand.  A narrow painted strip of metal fastened to the chassis carries the brunt of heat generated.  Being on the bottom and having no fins means that the heat is not spread at all resulting in overheating.  I put a cooling fan on it and it took a good 2 to 3 minutes to come back to life.  And I ran the rest of the tests that way.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWell, this ain\\'t a pretty sight.  One channel is much worse than the other.  No amount of playing with the grounding, or messing with the switch in the back helped with any of the mains/power supply related tones either.  The averaged ranking is below mean of all of the amps tested so far (77 amplifiers to date!):Crosstalk was poor, matching a $25 amplifier I tested:Frequency response is OK:Noise performance as you can predict from the dashboard is not fantastic:Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet\\'s get into the most important bit which is power capability starting with 4 and going into 8 ohms:Weird how one channel goes crazy at just 1 to 2 watt.  Specs are matched though.Allowing for higher distortion of 1% doesn\\'t help with max power but does give us more burst power:Thermal StabilityHere is the test that resulted in the shutdown:I was messing with grounding and caused that little blip so ignore that.ConclusionsI really like the cute and small form factor of this amp for desktop use.  Alas, with a weak thermal management, it won\\'t produce much volume before shutting down.  Used ones have probably had a hard life due to this reason as well.  If you are going to play with one and want to shy away from the million switching amplifiers out there in this price range, go ahead.  But I can\\'t recommend the unit.',\n",

The A-U671 costs US 499 but most vendors say it is no longer available even though it shows as current on Yamaha site.  How fast modern gear becomes obsolete...Yamaha has been clever to mimic the look of 1970s and 1980s switchgear:Alas, the controls are plastic and don't have nearly the nice feel of their old brethren.  The volume control is motorized though and is operable through the remote. A built-in DAC and analog input would nicely satisfy many people.  Unfortunately the unit arrived with something rattling in it. I took it part to find out it was a clamp of sort for the power supply bundle that had come loose.  I put it back together and all worked except the USB DAC.  I could control it, change its sample rate and such but it would not produce audio (with stock or Yamaha driver).  Another one of the power supply screws was also loose.  They should have put thread lock on them so that they don't come loose. The back panel is as expected but with decent quality speaker terminals:Since I had to take the unit apart anyway, here is a quick teardown:The DAC is on top and the amp on the bottom of the green board.  The yellow board is the switching power supply.  And that black wrapper is what had come lose.In use the amp was very quick to shut down on overload.  It would actually power off telling me it may be the power supply that is undersized. Temperature rise is not remotely an issue. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load @ 5 watts:I set the volume control manually to 29 dB as I normally do with integrated amps.  SINAD which represents the worst of noise and/or distortion is dominated by distortion.  At 70 dB, this is well below average:Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about either:Crosstalk is good (one channel bleeding into another):Frequency response is problematic, showing that it changes with your speaker load:Multitone shows frequency dependent error and high noise floor:Here are the power ratings:The regulated switching power supply allows no headroom:Thermal StabilityNot a whole lot changed with warm-up:ConclusionsI have a soft spot for the look of the Yamaha A-U671.  And inclusion of a USB DAC in a light and compact enclosure.  Not much else to hang your hat on from there on.  If you can find one at a yard sale for $100 it would be a good purchase.

       " ' Naim Uniti Atom streamer, DAC and integrated amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $3,799.The overall industry design is attractive and has a high-end look to it.  Alas, every part of the unit has an ultra sharp edge from heatsinks to edges of the plexiglass (?) front panel.  It is a heavy box which makes you really feel those sharp edges as if they are going to tear into your skin.  It was unpleasant every time I had to move or rotate the unit.The front panel is large and sharp which I like.  Alas, and strangely so, it is not a touch screen.  In this day and age and at this price, a touchscreen is a requirement in my opinion.  A very large rotary control managed the volume.  It seem to have some kind of acceleration but wasn\\'t very intuitive.Here is the back panel:I was surprised to see the compact binding posts that are made only for banana plugs.  Likewise there is no USB B to use the unit as a DAC.  Maybe you can use the type-A connector for that but even so, it is very unusual choice.  Nice to see a floating ground switch.  In my testing, it only impacted the networked tests.  Otherwise it had no effect.Inclusion of HDMI is very important to allow sound from TV to be piped into it.Upon booting and with Ethernet cable plugged in, it nicely told me there is new firmware.  It took something like 10 minutes to download the image and then went into a seemingly infinity cycles of booting, dark screen, non-descript progress bar and power button that would fade on or off or solid on.  I left there for probably half hour when it finally seem to be ready.There is the usual app to control it but I opted for the included remote control.  It too has very sharp edges but otherwise functional.Naim Uniti Atom DAC MeasurementsI started by testing the unit using Coax due to lack of type-B or type-c USB port.  Here is our usual dashboard:Distortion dominates causing our SINAD (noise+distortion) to barely reach into \"fair\" category:Distortion rises into the noise floor of even 16 bit content so not a good first showing.  As noted, changing the grounding mode made no difference in any of these measurements.The output stage is capable of higher voltage which is nice:Good to see the output does not become all distorted once the internal amplifier is pushed beyond clipping. Noise performance is not competitive with even budget DACs but almost good enough for 16-bit playback:Multitone distortion was quite high:Jitter display looks clean but noise floor is high and is masking interference patterns:Levels of those spurious tones though is quite low and inaudible (-128 dB).We have a rather odd filter response:This partially contributes to rather poor noise+distortion relative to frequency:Finally, linearity matches the fair performance of the rest of the system:Naim Uniti Atom Amplifier MeasurementGiven the choice of analog or digital input, I tested both which producing 5 watts:Performance is very close so I opted to use analog in as that makes the comparison to other amps easier.  Notice the high power supply noise at 120 Hz (double mains frequency in US).  Overall ranking is well below average:Frequency response test with analog input shows a brick wall filter which indicates input is being digitized:Shame then that no DSP functionality is provided.  The roll off filter in the ADC causes some drooping in the high frequencies.Crosstalk response was kind of shaky but overall good:Multitone test once again shows less than optimal performance:Rated power is low and that is what we see:Sweeping the frequency for power measurement we get orderly response:Notice the typical sharp drop in power at 20 Hz.  This is why you need more powerful amplifier than you think you are getting.  Power is needed in bass but the reservoir capacitors in the power supply get depleted and you don\\'t get as much output.Naim Unit Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI expected the headphone output to be \"junk\" but it actually is not:That is plenty of output for satisfactory response of high impedance headphones.  Noise floor is not competitive with any modern/recommended headphone amp but could have been far worse.  At 32 ohm though, available power is much more limited:Sweeping the load we see that the headphone amplifier is not capable of much current delivery:So best to stay with high impedance headphones.Naim Uniti Atom Streaming MeasurementsI ran the streaming tests a day later and here, I noticed noise bleeding into the output:So I tried the ground lift switch and it remedied that:SINAD though is dominated by high distortion so didn\\'t matter one way or the other.  And performance is the same as local/coax S/PDIF input.ConclusionsPerformance of Naim Atom ranges from fair/adequate to rather poor.  Shame that when you pay so much for a piece of audio, not much design hygiene is included.  I suspect more went into software development and enclosure design than making sure the hardware is performant.  I hope for a version 2 the company works to substantially improve the performance of these subsystems.  I am sure many buy a Naim product thinking they are getting great audio performance.I can\\'t recommend the Naim Uniti Atom streaming amplifier.P.S.  I was going to give the mailman panther rating to the unit but he is out making deliveries......',\n",
       " ' vintage Audio Research D300 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a local member.  The D300 came out circa 1995 and initially cost US $3,500 but then price rose to US $4,000.  Quick search shows used ones going for US $1,500.The D300 is built like a tank:I am confident you could drive over it and nothing will happen to it.  Even the handles are massive which is a blessing as an ultra heavy transformer sits vertically behind the front panel. I could carry the D300 by myself so it is not too heavy to be unmanageable. The back panel is as you expect:With one exception: the non-detachable power cord.   What is there though seems amply sufficient as it is supple yet quite thick.Heatsinks are very thick gauge and in use, they got warm but not hot.  The rest of the case got warm as well.  The amp never complained no matter what I did to it in testing.Overall, if you want an understated but high quality feel, that is what you have in D300.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Ouch.  Lots of second harmonic causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion and noise to be rather poor.  As such the D300 lands well below average in our list of some 62 amplifiers tested to date:Noise performance was quite good though so it is the distortion that is the problem:32-tone test signal representing \"music\" showed what we already know as far as rather high distortion levels:Frequency response was excellent:As was crosstalk (one channel bleeding into the other):Let\\'s get into the meat of the measurements with power vs THD+N starting at 4 ohm:Boy, this is worse than the dashboard indicated.  Almost immediately, distortion takes over and keeps climbing.  While the D300 is much more quiet, it quickly loses to an integrated home theater receiver (NAD T758)!  Not good.Same story repeats for 8 ohm load:Distortion is so high at higher power levels that if we set a limit of 0.1% for THD+N, we only get 60 watts out of each channel!Relaxing that to 0.2% though gave us a lot more power and no indication of frequency mattering.  This was proven yet again in our multiple sweeps:All the lines fall on top of each other indicating the amp just doesn\\'t care what frequency you feed it.  It amplifies it, adds a heap of distortion and that is that. Makes you want to cry and celebrate at the same time!ConclusionsThere is clear excellence in the engineering in Audio Research D300.  Build quality is superb as well.  There must have been a conscious decision to use low amount of feedback which translated into rising distortion with power.  It is a shame that capable designers follow audiophile myths to build non-performant amplifiers when they could do so much better.In this day and age, this type of performance is not competitive so I really can\\'t recommend the D300.  Then again if you want something with high build quality and can get the unit on the cheap, it makes for a decent option.',\n",
       " \" Topping PA3 desktop amplifier.  I have had a ton of requests to measure this amplifier so I asked the company to send me one.  They said they would do so but cautioned me that it would not measure well.  The PA3 costs US $120 on Amazon including free shipping.I must stay, compared to all the budget amplifiers I have tested, the PA3 looks like luxury goods!  It comes in a hefty case and oozes quality:There are dual inputs as you see which you can control using the power button.  A massive, Topping branded external power supply is provided which even goes as far as having textured design on the back side:Most importantly, all the regulatory certifications are there which we know from past examination to be true and certified by third-party labs.  This is one budget amplifier I wouldn't hesitate to leave on unattended.Implementation is based on TDA7498E ST Micro chip amp.  Topping PA3 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm using 1 kHz tone:As you see I adjusted the volume control to give us the nominal 29 dB gain I usually test at.  SINAD is dominated by distortion which at 0.036% which correlates well with ST Micro's 0.05% spec at 1 watt.  Alas, this is well below average for all amplifiers we have tested and some of the latest chip amp products:SNR slots in the same bucket of performance:Crosstalk is pretty good showing good attention to isolation:Frequency response unfortunately is very load dependent:We get about 51 watts into 4 ohm with both channels driven with distortion dominating (hence the reason the graph doesn't slope down):Power naturally drops with 8 ohm load but not as much some others I have seen:Peak power matches company spec which is a novelty in this space:Note that there was a really strong protection circuit that would not allow me to push the amp more than I did for max power so I had to settle for lower distortion of 0.5%.  It would shut down if I told it to work harder to hit 1%.Distortion takes off rather quickly with frequency as we see in multitone test:Same is see in our frequency versus power and distortion+noise:Fortunately our hearing threshold starts to go up at higher frequencies so audibility is less impacted than our sensibility about good engineering.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping did what it could to build a reliable, safe and robust desktop platform for this amplifier.  Alas, they are held down significantly by the performance of the underlying chip amp which is likely all that was available at the time this product was designed.  Being selfish elitist audiophile engineering types that we are, we have no choice but to pass on this amplifier.  If you are not picky however and want something that is build safe and well, you could choose otherwise.So to repeat, I can't recommend the Topping PA3 based on its audio performance.  Hopefully there are future products based on a better platform.\",\n",
       " ' Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 integrated amplifier with tube buffer.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,599.The front panel of the Sphinx portrays a high-end look with its thick metal:Alas, that thin metal surrounding it, takes that impression away.  I liked the very wide apart inputs and output terminals which \"should\" bode well for crosstalk measurements:There is good bit of weight to the unit courtesy of power transformer.  I like the inclusion of the balance control.  As you see in the first picture, I had to use it to get same gain out of both channels.  Protection circuit was well done with automatic recovery and worked great no matter how hard I pushed it.Internal amplification is provided by a pair of Hypex UCD 180 OEM class D amplifiers.  A buffer state made out of tubes completes the picture.The amplifier has won many accolades as indicated by their mention on the product page:Let\\'s see if objectively they are right.Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 MeasurementsAs usual, I set the gain to 29 dB and feed the amp a 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm at 5 watts and see what we get:What we get is not very nice.  Broad set of harmonics to the tune of -80 dB do away with any notion of \"tube sound.\"  Add fair bit of noise and SINAD which is a measure of distortion+noise sinks quite low:That\\'s 10 dB worse than the media across 140 amplifiers tested so far.  Not good.  As a reference, Hypex specifications shows a SINAD of 84 dB so 15 dB was lost in the addition of the buffer stage in this amplifier.Another thing that is not good is signal to noise ratio:So even at full power your 2 bits short of CD\\'s dynamic range. The shocker was the normally \"innocent\" crosstalk test which just about every amplifier does well in:Then comes Sphinx, losing to our $20 throw-away amplifier!  Clearly zero attention was paid to isolation of the two channels.Frequency response also shows sloppy attention to producing the audible band properly:Let\\'s measure our power vs distortion:Definitely much less happy driving 4 ohm load.  Here is our peak and max power:So moderately powerful although without much headroom.ConclusionsRogue Audio takes a perfectly serviceable Hypex UcD 180 amplifiers and adds copious amount of noise and distortion with its front-end.  Mind you, despite use of the tube, it doesn\\'t give that 2nd harmonic dominant result.  It just raises the noise and distortion, robbing you of transparency.  But hey, folks buy audio products by how many myths are included in their design and Rogue audio gets there with that tube stage.  Perfect marketing, poor engineering.  Story of high-end audio.Needless to say, I can NOT recommend the Rogue Audio Sphinx V3.  You can get plenty of better amplifiers for this level of money.',\n",
       " ' Behringer NX3000D Pro DSP power amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me by a member.  It costs US $399.As pro amplifiers go, the NX3000D is half attractive especially when on with its amber lights and LEDs:There are variable (analog) gains as you see.  I did not play with the DSP or menu system but it lets you do such useful things as setting up a crossover to drive a sub.  There is built-in power limiting in there.The unit is quite light.  So light that you think it may fly away given its large and noisy fan:The fan unfortunately is not temperature sensitive and wails away upon power up!  I am sure saving weight is a big deal when you try to squeeze every dollar out of shipping costs.  Good news is that as they advertise, this thing runs as cool as it can get.  After a bunch of testing, the temperature was the same as the room.Note that speaker connections are SpeakOn which I like but not common in consumer audio.  Inputs are only balanced XLR/1/4 combo.  There is extra gain though to use RCA unbalanced with them using an adapter.  Where I placed the gain knobs provided 29 dB of gain.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amp 1 kHz and see what else it outputs beside that at 5 watts into 4 ohm test load:What it outputs is a bunch of distortion in the form of third harmonic at 3 kHz placing the unit well below average:Note also the disparity in channel output which you can also see in the frequency response measurement:The gain controls are notched so not easy to select any in-between gains to adjust for this.Another news is how narrow the bandwidth is.  Being a DSP amplifier, it digitizes the input and it seems to use 48 kHz sampling resulting in bandwidth of 24 kHz.Noise performance is not that great at 5 watts, falling well below 96 dB we like to see for CD/streaming 16-bit content:Fortunately at full power (right), you do clear that hurdle.These amps are sold almost exclusively by how much power they produce versus their cost so let\\'s get into that with 4 ohm load:Seems like the rated power numbers are a fantasy unless they are measured for one channel driven, not two as I do.  Still, 400 watts is lots of power in such a cheap package.  You get a  bit more as well if you allow the distortion to rise to 1% and also measure it as a peak (right):Switching the load to 8 ohms naturally lowers available power:Switching/class-D amps can have complex distortion profiles that highly depend on frequency and power level and we see some of that here:At higher frequencies different distortion mechanisms become dominant causing the curves to go up and down. While I always see some power loss at 20 Hz, it is disappointing to see it dip so low to just 268 watts for an amplifier rated at \"900 watts.\"  Bass is where we need the power.Finally, we can remove our filter and examine the ultrasonic spectrum to see what the amp is producing there:Switching frequency seems to be around 410 kHz which is well above the audible band, and is attenuated quite a lot for a switching amplifier (-26 dB).  I am not too happy to see so much other junk there though although not audible per se.ConclusionsPro amps can often make good alternative to hi-fi amps since they are sold at much lower cost/watt than consumer products.  We get that in Behringer NX3000D but we also get the other drawbacks of pro products in the form of high fan noise.  And distortion that is pretty high.  If you can hide it some place and use it to do drive a subwoofer it should be fine.  But otherwise, I think a more quiet amplifier would work better for home hifif than this unit.Overall, the Behringer NX3000D is not my cup of tea for home use so I can\\'t recommend it.',\n",

Love the elegant front panel with VU meter. Nice set of balance and tone controls are provided as well:As you can see, power amplification is provided through ECC83 triode drivers going to EL84 power tubes. Amplifier is conservatively designed and is rate at just 10+10 watts into 6 ohms. I like the look without the cage but here it is with:Not much exciting in the back other than modern, beefy speaker terminals than that of vintage tube amplifiers:The package is smaller than one imagines but weighs a hefty 27 pounds.  Notice the AC terminal doesn\\'t have earth ground and unit is double insulated. In testing I found no effect from earthing the unit or not.Front-end and pre-amps are solid state:Luxman SQ-N150 Amplifier MeasurementsWhen I picked 5 watts as my standard for measuring amplifiers, it was usually a fraction of the amplifier power but here it is nearly half the available power!  So relatively speaker, distortion plays a much strong role than it would otherwise:The high second and third harmonics set the stage as far as SINAD (due to push-pull design) but I wish there was not so much power supply noise.  Sadly the amplifier takes up the ranking of second worst amplifier I have ever measured as far as distortion+noise:Those power supply spikes set the lower bound for dynamic range:It is not too bad but you likely will use very sensitive speakers with this low power amplifier so the numbers may manifest themselves more than they usually do.Frequency response is extended but shows a kink indicating some kind of filter:Crosstalk does not follow the usual curve indicating some sort of resistive (?) element between the two channels:Normally the issue is capacitive which causes the two reference lines you see.Multitone which is supposed to resemble \"music\" with its 32 tone, shows strong level of \"grass\" (intermodulation distortion):Hard to make a case that you are hearing more detail when so much is masked at this power level.I don\\'t have a 6 ohm load so used my usual 4 and 8 ohm loads for power testing:',\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of Optoma/NuForce STA-200 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  I see it listed for USD $499 including Prime shipping.  Looking elsewhere, it appears to have a list price of $1299.This is one attractive enclosure that does not usually come in a $500 package:The finish is slightly textured and looks pretty nice.Feature wise, there is nothing there but a set of RCA inputs and speakers.  The RCA inputs are paired with speaker terminals on each end of the unit so you better have RCA cables that separate that much.Somewhat out of character is a traditional extruded aluminum heatsink poking out the back.   I guess this avoids having to put the heatsink inside and having to vent the enclosure.  The heatsink is pretty small though and it was cooking even when testing the unit at just 5 watts/channel.  I worry about its ability to run OK at full power for any extended amount of time.Rated power is 80 watts/channel with 8 ohm load.  My testing was at 4 ohm however.Let\\'s get into measurements and see how she does.MeasurementsAs with my previous amplifier tests, let\\'s start with a dashboard view of the unit while it was outputting 5 watts:Boy, this is disappointing.  We have tons of mains and power supply components (which I reduced somewhat by grounding one leg of the speaker terminals to my AP analyzer).  The dominant distortion components are the cause of poor SINAD though with the second harmonic peaking up to nearly -70 dB.  So even if the rest were not there, the SINAD would remain the same.Company states THD+N of < 0.03% and we are essentially there so our testing is correct.  The write-up brags about response up to 1 Mhz and such.  I suspect instead of using fair amount of feedback to bring the distortion down, they have traded for wider bandwidth. Looking at the power rating versus distortion, the STA-200 doesn\\'t bring much to the party over the much cheaper Topping TP60 ($199):Yes, there is less noise at lower power levels but by the time we get to 1 watt, they equalize in performance and at limit, the Topping TP60 (red) actually has less distortion.The spec says the signal to noise ratio is 100 dB.  My measurements fall somewhat short of that:Likely the mains intrusion is the cause (which would vary from installation to installation).Sweeping input level and measuring IMD we get:As with THD, the STA200 has good bit less noise than Topping TP-60 but then suddenly clips and clips badly.  Looking at the gain we see why:This is a lot of gain for a low power amplifier.  No wonder sensitivity is spec\\'ed at just 0.45 volt (versus nominal 2 volts).  This means if you may have to significantly turn down the volume in your pre-amp/dac+pre.  This would make for an amp that plays loud due to its high gain and perhaps that is a conscious choice.Frequency response is reasonable to 40 kHz (0.3 dB down):Anyway, I think we have enough here to know the merits of this amplifier.ConclusionsI was pretty depressed when I reviewed the Topping TP60 and FX Audio FX502SPro and had high hopes that the NuForce STA200 would easily outperform them.  Such was not the case.  The Topping TP60 at less than half the price essentially matches its performance.  It also runs substantially cooler than this unit.  It doesn\\'t look quite as nice though although it has a more manageable desktop form factor if that is how you use it.The NuForce ST-200 seems to cater the audiophile myth of \"fast\" and high-bandwidth amplifiers, sacrificing fidelity to get there.  This is a poor trade off in my book when just about all the content we play is quite band limited.',\n",
       " ' Sabaj A1 desktop (small) amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  Not sure if it is still in production but you can still find it for $60 or so.  Main interest in testing this unit is the use of the TPA3118 class D amplifier which is used in all kinds of other devices including Genelec 8030c powered monitor!For the price the enclosure is not half bad:A little LED display shows the active input (there are two) and current volume level.  As is typical, a laptop sized power supply provides the juice:The unit runs cool.  If you overtax it, it will reset and power back on at low output level.Sabaj A1 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt dashboard:As you see I set the gain to 29 dB which is the \"standard\" I use for integrated amplifiers.  Resulting SINAD is dominated by distortion and is well below average for all amps tested:But... if you compare it to other low cost amps in this price bracket, performance is a good 10 dB better.Noise performance is in the same class:Frequency response is not flat but good to see it rolling off as opposed to peaking:Crosstalk is what you expect in this type of device:Most important is power and this is how the A1 did into 4 ohm:Not a whole lot of power I am afraid.  Pushing it harder didn\\'t do any good either:The power supply runs out of juice and the device shuts down.  May do better with a more powerful power supply.  Here it is into 8 ohm:ConclusionsAs a class I expect these cheap amps to be broken.  The A1 is not that bad.  My concern is too little power.  Many small speakers are inefficient and you need more than 20 watts to get decent performance out of them.  My suggestion is to save on spending money on food and flowers and save up for a better amp.  But if you can\\'t, the Sabaj A1 may do the job for you.As it is, I can\\'t recommend the Sabaj A1.

Member purchased it for just $158 on sale!You probably can\\'t tell from the picture but this is a massive box.  It weighs over 50 pounds/23 kilograms and is quite deep.  Rack mounts are provided and needed for both front and back. A review says the back holes don\\'t align right however.  Back panel shows why this amplifier is also tailored for multi-room distribution:\\\\By selecting \"bus mode,\" a single input is distributed to any number of channels from 1 to 8.  In mono or stereo.  Trim pots are provided to adjust the gain for each channel although there were kind of too sensitive to set accurately.The side panels gave me paus until I powered the unit:I feared that those fans would make huge amount of noise but to my pleasant surprise, they barely move and are essentially silent.  They never sped up or got louder during testing.  This is far better solution than my pro amps I test with loud and small fans that are not even temperature sensitive.Back to the front, the power switch is quite bright (blue) and bleeds into the LED bar graphs.  But once the unit is on, the LED bar graphs themselves light up and more or less cover that issue.  The power switch feels quite solid.Pyle as a brand is know for cheap (read junk) so my expectations were not high going into the review.  The overall construction though, with dual toroidal transformers in front, portrayed a different picture.  Let\\'s see how it measures.Pyle PT8000CH MeasurementsI stayed with stereo measurements for this section selecting the channels 7 and 8 that are next to the AC power input.  Warm up allowed the amp to improve a bit:Here is our dashboard:We have a spray of harmonic distortion that sinks SINAD fairly low:Zooming in:We see that the company that it keeps is not too bad!  SNR falls inline or perhaps a bit better:Multitone is as we would expect from the dashboard:Frequency response is good although I wished for a bit more bandwidth as to get a flatter response to 20 kHz:Crosstalk though was surprisingly poor:Let\\'s see how much power we have into 2 channels:Benefit of large power supply comes in when just driving in stereo:Here is 8 ohm performance (company spec = 100 watts):Finally, here is power vs frequency:Here is on/off noise:I hooked up the amplifier to an infinity R253 speaker and I could hear a faint pop on power up.  Power off seemed silent although the fan noise may have masked that.Multichannel Amplifier TestingMy analyzer is only stereo but I drove all channels with the same 8 ohm load.  Here is the output power in stereo and 8 channels:We are meeting spec here which is good (there is some nonsense about 8000 watts peak which we forgive and ignore).All the testing so far has been resistive.  Let\\'s make the load \"reactive\" by 30 and 60 degrees angle and also sweep down to 2 ohm and see what happens:This is quite robust!  At both 4 and 8 ohms, the amp doesn\\'t care if the load is reactive or not.  At 2 ohm though, it starts to complain, dropping its output voltage by nearly half.  Testing at 1 ohm resulted in momentary shutdown.ConclusionsThe build quality of this 8-channel amplifier seems quite substantial.  Massive power supply courtesy of dual toroidal transformers powers the 8 channels well, allowing the amplifier to meet spec.  Distortion and noise are rather high though and rank well below our average.  The amplifier protection and ability to handle complex loads is excellent. You are paying almost nothing for this amplifier (the case alone could cost you this much!) yet you get way above a broken design.  The PT8000CH won\\'t be my main choice for a high-performance 2-channel system but for surround duty and certainly multi-room amplification, it seems fine.I am going to recommend the Pyle PT8000CH.  Not because it has great measured performance as far as noise and distortion.  But that it delivers way, way above its cost point.',\n",
       " \" Topping MX3 DAC, Bluetooth, Headphone Amplifier, and Power amplifier.  You even get a remote control with it. Despite all that functionality it costs just USD $130 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  I bought mine from Massdrop 10 months ago.  I don't know what I paid but likely less.From the outside, the MX3 looks quite attractive:It has the same design language as the Topping DX3 Pro but even more attractive with that slanted logo.  The volume control is digital and very sensitive.  There is a ton of functionality here which I won't go into as there is a good review of it from Z which I will post after this review.  Suffice it to say, it is very feature rich and well designed for such a bargain product.Everything is powered by an external laptop sized switching power supply:Not only is extra expense incurred in getting a Topping branded power supply, but typical of them it comes with full compliance with regulatory bodies both in US and EU.For most of my testing, I used the USB input but did give the Aux analog input a try as well.  I did not test the subwoofer out.  Not did I play with Bluetooth.If the MX3 performs, it will be the audio miracle of modern times so let's get into measurements.  But first a note: I had to take some shortcuts to get through all of this functionality.  I think it represents the missing measurements.DAC MeasurementsThere are no line outs on the MX3 so I used the headphone output set to 2 volts to get our dashboard view:Oh no! Distortion is fairly high putting the MX3 in bottom class of all DACs tested:This is quite a bit worse than any DAC Topping has produced and will set the limit for the rest of the measurements.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our all important power versus distortion+noise at 300 ohm:The higher noise and distortion in the dashboard comes into play here putting the MX3 fair bit behind its look-alike, Topping DX3 Pro.  At 33 milliwatt power before clipping, there is not sufficient amount for a desktop amplifier.  Then again if you listen to the DX3 Pro in low gain, there is more power here than there.Using 33 ohm load we examine the current delivery of the headphone amplifier:Similar story here except 230 milliwatts is good amount of power for low impedance headphones.I was pleasantly surprised to see a very low output impedance in MX3:This means you can use any headphone with the MX3 and not have its frequency response change because of output impedance.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsOur dashboard for power amplifier calls for 5 watts of output:The amplifier is quite a bit worse than the DAC, showing a disappointing SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) of just 68 dB.  This is not performance you want to brag about to your friends:Here is the full power curve into 4 ohm load:Usually amplifiers keep reducing their THD+N as the signal gets stronger relative to noise.  Not so here.  Distortion is high enough that at just 1 watt, it starts to dominate and flattens the curve until clipping at about 30 watts.  More power can be had if you get it spike up a bit as shown so the unit meets its spec of I think 40 watts into 4 ohm.Here is the THD+N versus power versus frequency:The issue here is rising distortion in high frequencies regardless of amount of power being output.  1 kHz test tone we use in the dashboard then is almost the best case scenario.  By the way, the above test was performed with Aux input so that I could vary the input voltage as I do with other power amplifiers.Here is out signal to noise ratio:So not quite as good as CD's dynamic range.Listening TestsI only tested the headphone amplifier this way.  I will at some point start testing with speakers.With Sennheiser HD-650 high impedance headphone, there was good bit of power giving a physical sensation of bass.  Alas, by then distortion would set it and the sound would get bright and corrupted.Things changed with much lower impedance Hifiman HE-400i.  There was plenty of volume here and I had to try really hard to get it to distort.  It would do so but at levels I did not want to listen to for more than a second or two.  Bass sensation was quite good bringing the full dynamic range out of these headphones which lesser powered headphone amplifiers cannot.ConclusionsThe only bright spot in the Topping MX3 performance is its headphone amplifier especially with low impedance headphones.  Outside of that, the MX3 disappoints.  While nothing is broken and design clearly verified (Audio Precision graphs are included in the manual), the bar was set quite low to meet the price point. Is the MX3 transparent enough?  Probably for most people.  Is it transparent enough for me to recommend it?  No.  You are much better off with discrete components.  You will be paying more though to get that performance.Am I being too critical?  We had fish chips yesterday at our favorite waterfront restaurant and it cost $57 for the three of us.  Two of those meals and you can have the Topping MX3.  So the value is incredible.  Let me know what you think. \",\n",

       " ' (vintage?) Sunfire Cinema Grand five channel power amp designed by Bob Carver. It is on kind loan from a member. In 1996 it cost US $2,375. This unit is from 1999 and has had its caps upgraded.I can\\'t say I am a fan of this look.  The meter shows an obscure measurement of the \"power supply joules.\" The dial never moves so it is useless.Back panel shows some deviations from norm as well:In addition to normal speaker terminals, the front channels also have \"current output.\"  This just means that there is a 1 ohm resistor in series with the output.  This causes voltage/power loss that is inversely proportional to the impedance of the speaker.  As such, it varies the frequency response of the speaker so can have different tonality.There is balanced XLR input which is what I used for my testing.This amplifier is the third iteration of Bob Carver.  After leaving Phase Linear, he designed the \"Magnetic Field\" amplifier under the Carver name.  That product varies the AC duty cycle as a way to change the incoming AC voltage and with it, the output DC.  This lowers the losses in the output transistors since they don\\'t have to operate for worst case (maximum power).  See my review of Carver M-1.5t amplifier.  Bob then left and started Sunfire and with it, came this amplifier design.  Instead of crudely changing the AC duty cycle, this amplifier has a DC to DC converter which tracks the incoming music.  The higher the input level, the more it will increase its output voltage, thereby keeping the output transistors in their optimal voltage level.  Result again is very high efficiency compared to normal class AB design.  Let\\'s measure it to see how well it works.BTW, there are two versions of this: one at 200 watts and one at 400 watts.  Maybe I am going blind but I could not see any designation of such on the unit. Carver Cinema Grand Amplifier MeasurementsAs with the M-15.t, I noticed a lot of noise before I fed the unit a signal so let\\'s look at that:We see that the dc to dc converter is pass through a lot of AC noise and harmonics.  This impacts the performance of the unit:While second harmonic distortion dominates at -72 dB, the mains noise is not far behind, causing SINAD (relative sum of noise+distortion) to drop further to just 67 dB.  This is ranks pretty close to the bottom of all the amplifiers tested:SNR is not good as a result of that noise:Multitone at 5 watts suffers from both power supply spikes and high intermodulation distortion:Crosstalk is surprisingly poor:There seems to be inductive leakage at frequencies below 5 kHz which I am guessing is bleed through the shared power DC to DC converter.Oddest thing was the frequency response:There is some verbiage from Bob Carver about \"voicing\" the amplifier.  Perhaps this is intentional but then why is one channel different than the other?Claim to fame here is high power capability so let\\'s see if it delivers on that:It does indeed.  At the expense of noise and distortion but still, a 37 pound amplifier of the time, with 5 channels no less, would be in no position to produce such a power.The new DC to DC converter is regulated so no headroom power:There is healthy power at 8 ohm as well:I had to lower the input level substantially to get the amp to run the frequency dependence as it would pull back severely at higher frequencies:The lines are very high in vertical scale indicating high noise and distortion which we already know about.  What we had not seen is the difficulty the amp has with high frequencies.  This is likely due to the dc to dc converter not being able to track the voltage at higher frequencies.  Fortunately music naturally has far lower level at higher frequencies so actual impact is low.Finally, the amplifier is stable from power on:Scale is heavily exaggerated with the one channel improving just 1 dB.  And the other being stable from start.ConclusionsBob seems to have gotten the \"high order bit\" right in figuring out how to produce a high efficiency, high power amplifier.  Alas, much of the talk is about fidelity and in that department, this is a poor showing.  Mains noise gets through readily and distortion is quite high even by 1996 standards.  From buying used point of view, the cool running environment of this amp means that it ages very well so the risks are lower.  Then again that dc to dc converter brings a lot more complexity to the design.Overall, the Carver Cinema Grand is not something I would recommend.  But I can see people purchasing it as a lightweight, multichannel amplifier that delivers a lot of power.  To the extent you can purchase it for a lot less than modern class D amps, it would be a decent buy.P.S. no, I don\\'t have any more carver amps to test.    Nor did I seek them out.

On Amazon, it cost US $128 but the owner found it on \"Woot\" for just $70.  They are sold out there though.Not a half-bad enclosure especially for the price:It was so confusing to see dual languages on the front panel and the back:I left the bass and treble controls as you see them there.  For testing, I adjusted the gain to 29 dB which is my standard for testing.Amazon Basics 80W MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amplifier a 1 kHz tone with enough amplitude to produce 5 watts and see what we get:Well, this is not good.  Distortion (third harmonic) is quite high at around 68 dB causing the SINAD to be pretty close to the bottom of all the amps we have tested:Frequency response showed high sensitivity relative to (speaker) load:Crosstalk was horrible:How the heck they screwed this up?  The dashed line in teal is a $25 amplifier.32-tone test shows what we saw in the dashboard more or less:We can\\'t clear 16 bit content even at max power:Power curve shows early onset of distortion:At least spec is met (at 4 ohm):Sweeping with different frequencies we see distortion rises a lot with frequency:ConclusionsI am a sucker for a bargain as much as the next person.  But there comes a line that I hate to cross and this amplifier forces me to do so.  There are just so many faults here.  If you want to use it in a garage or workshop, it will be fine and run cooler than little desktop amps.  That is the only positive thing I can say about it.Needless to say, I can\\'t recommend the Amazon Basics 80 Watt amplifier.',\n",
       " ' OSD Nero Stream-XD analog and digital streaming (wifi and Bluetooth) amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member for testing.  It costs US $230 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  There is a bit of heft to this box considering its budget category:There is a rotary control for volume and input selection.  Naturally with no display, you don\\'t know the volume level.  Various inputs are provided although USB is for storage device, not as a DAC:I focused my testing on analog and Toslink inputs.Like the inclusion of power supply in the unit which likely is the reason for some of its weight.  In use, it got warm to touch but nothing concerning.OSD Nero Stream-XD MeasurementsLet\\'s start with using the analog input and see how it does:Well, this is not good.  There is strange/high noise floor plus plenty of distortion.  Perhaps it digitizes the analog input?  Let\\'s test Toslink then:Same bad results.    It ranks way at the bottom of our rankings:Can the news get worse?  Yes, it can:There is a subwoofer output so maybe this is someone\\'s idea of high pass filter!  I looked in the manual and there are no tone controls that could be responsible for this.Let me just post the rest of the graphs and not waste words on a failing design:ConclusionsThis is a prime example of what we in the industry call \"phoned in design.\"  You call up a shop in China, given them your wish list and out comes an amp.  You do no testing yourself and put no requirements as far as performance on the shop that is \"designing\" it.  Result is all the checklist items marketing wants with performance not even on the back of the priority list.  Does it sound better than a sound bar when paired with a couple of speakers?  Should that frequency response not screw things up too bad, maybe.  For me?  I pass and get an AVR instead.',\n",
       " ' Nubert nuConnect ampX digital integrated amplifier and wireless connector.  It was purchased by a member from the company in Germany and drop shipped to me.  The ampX costs €689 (US $766).The outside imparts confidence as far as weight and industrial design:Beauty is skin deep though.  The menu structure is very strange.  For example you hit the \"return\" button to get into options and then rotate the number to select.  Hitting return gets you back one step but never back to home menu above.  You have to select \"Volume\" and click on that to get back home.  I had the volume too high once as soon as I changed inputs and could not turn it down immediately.When you turn the unit off with the standby button on the left, a dim display remains saying ampX.  I hope that is not an OLED display or that would be burnt in after a short while.  Why do I need to see that text on the display?  The standby button already turns orange.The rear panel shows the plethora of option to feed the ampX:You have phono state, Bluetooth, and Wifi besides allt he other inputs.  What\\'s more using their app and the microphone in the phone you are supposed to be able to correct for room modes under 160 Hz (I did not test this).Audio MeasurementsI started with our usual dashboard with USB input to ampX and speaker out at 5 watts:Boy, this is not good.  We have high noise floor plus ton sand tons of harmonics and we are at just 5 watts.  I thought may be analog input would be different so tested that:It is a different sort of bad but overall in the same bucket of \"well below average:\"Signal to noise ratio is verypoor:Never seen an amplifier that doesn\\'t improve its signal to noise ratio when you turn it up.  The noise must be getting amplified proportionally with volume.32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows the same problems:Look at those spikes in mid frequencies rising to almost -50 dB.  This is where our hearing is starting to get most sensitive.Frequency response was terrible with digital or analog inputs:There is a high pass filter which I could not figure how to defeat so let it be at 10 Hz.  It must cause that terrible peaking at low frequencies.  Conversely, there is a sharp filter at 20 kHz which roll off starting even earlier.  We are down 3 dB by the time we get to 20 kHz.  And this is with digital input and sample rate of 96 kHz!Let\\'s test the power amp to full power starting at 4 ohm:That is a lot worse than a typical AVR.  Same is true with 8 ohm load:Thermal AnalysisPerformance improved a bit over half of running at 5 watts:ConclusionsI tell you: if manufacturers post measurements, I am sure they would have caught these issues themselves.  Even a marketing person would know the above frequency response would not sell a single unit.  But no.  Customers don\\'t ask for it so manufactures just throw a few numbers over the fence.  Those numbers did point to problems:We actually did better at 0.05%!  How they got this SNR, I don\\'t know :ConclusionsI get the appeal of \"do it all\" amplifier with modern streaming features.  But come on.  Let\\'s get the basics right.  The amp needs to be low noise and distortion and have flat response.  And spend some time make the unit easier to navigate.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Nubert nuConnect ampX.  It had high promise but did not remotely get there.',\n",
       " \" Fosi Audio BT10A Bluetooth Class D stereo amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The B10A seems to have just been updated with tone controls and sells for US $50 from Amazon with free prime shipping.This is a very small amplifier:You can't see the depth but it is quite shallow.  Other amps like this I have tested have complicated interface to change built-in digital tone controls.  There are none here so it was easy to use.The back connectors is identical to what you see on myriad of such amps:While the external laptop replacement power supply is large compared to the size of the unit, it is not as huge as some others.  Note that it comes with a three-prong, figure-8 AC socket so you have less options to replace the cord.I did not bother testing the Bluetooth.  I am assuming it autoselects it if in range as the priority input as there is no switch to select it.Speaker terminals are tiny of course but I managed to plug in my heavy and large banana jacks into it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain (THX recommendation):Second harmonic dominates to the tune of -65 dB which sets the SINAD to the same value.  This says that noise is not a contributor to SINAD and as such, any gain setting would have produced similar SINAD.  The 65 dB SINAD value doesn't put a smile on anyone's face but it is a couple of steps above $30 units (e.g. Lepy LP-2020A):Noise figures are barely adequate:32-tone test signal shows more or less uniform distortion at all frequencies:19+20 kHz tones shows 55 dB of distortion-free range:Their full (and unrealistic) amplitude shows higher distortions than multitone test does.Frequency response shows truncated low and high frequencies:Above with a resistor load.  Subjective the amp to my new complex speaker model of a 2-way speaker generates:The speaker model has a its impedance shooting up in high frequencies causing similar issue here.  There is a question of whether the model is similar to mass of 2-way speakers so don't run with this yet.  What you can conclude is that the speaker choice does impact the speaker response.  In audible band though, the impact is minimal and in some way is correcting the dip toward 20 kHz.  A good amp would have no speaker load dependency.Let's see how much power the BT10A can produce into 4 ohm load:At 33 watts with both channels driven this is good bit of power.  Similar story with 8 ohm load:Lack of power is by far the #1 issue in these amplifiers.  You may not be able to hear their noise and distortions but you absolutely will hear them complain when they clip.  At these power levels you should have a reasonable experience unlike some other budget amps that stop at 10 watts or so.Allowing for more distortion (1% THD+N) and testing with a short-term sinewave and long term produces identical numbers:The input power supply is regulated so there is no reservoir to provide short-term juice. Thermal StabilityPerformance gradually improved by a 2 dB or so after 30 minutes of playing at 5 watts:Above tests were performed after this warm-up period.ConclusionsThe Fosi Audio BT10A doesn't seem half bad.  I am not going to provide a verdict one way or the other.  You can decide for yourself if the performance is good enough for your application.\",\n",
       " ' Audio Research Corporation (ARC) 100.2 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 100.2 came out in year 1998 at a cost of US $2,995.  It was later raised to US $3,495.  If I remember correctly, the owner told me this the last solid state amplifier ARC produces before going to all tube route.The 100.2 is as solid as a rock:The back panel is as you expect with the exception of (custom?) speaker binding posts:In use the 100.2 cooked and cooked good.  I measured 45 to 47 degrees C on the heatsinks.  The internal temps are likely much higher.  I read that it uses unobtanium output MOSFET transistors so if they go, you likely have a giant door stop.    In use though the 100.2 did not complain one bit and ran through all of my tests.Strangely when you power the unit down, it takes it a while to do that.  What it is doing, I don\\'t know.The design of the unit is based on low feedback factor of just 6 dB.  Based on that alone I can tell you it is not going to perform well.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWe have huge power supply peaks, like due to poor power supply rejection ratio of low feedback design.  Second and third harmonic dominate the distortion profile resulting in lackluster SINAD of just 65 dB.  That lands the ARC 100.2 near the bottom of some 72 amplifiers tested so far:Frequency response is excellent:Response changes some with a simulated 2-way speaker load but nothing to cry over:Multitone test shows the high distortion products of the power supply:And rather high noise floor which we can directly measure using signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk shape is odd but not an audible concern:Amplifier Power MeasurementsThe sins of low feedback factor stare at you in the face with our 4 ohm load:Yes, distortion gradually increases but then it clips anyway.  So why not have clean power until clipping???Same deal into 8 ohms:At least it slightly exceeds its power specifications.Strangely burst power (momentary peaks) doesn\\'t generate much more power:Keeping THD+N constant at 0.1% gives us incredibly low and strange amount of power:There is so much distortion and noise in the output of this amp that you don\\'t get much power if you set your goal at 0.1% THD (likely threshold of audibility for some people).  FYI I ran the above at 0.2% THD+N (not shown) and it produced about 80 watts with a straight line.  Anyway, who says only class D amps have trouble with this test?Amplifier Thermal stabilityI powered the unit cold and let it run nearly half hour while recording distortion and noise. This is what I got:That is very high degree of improvement.  Again, low feedback means that it is more sensitive to operating temperature.  Given the high heat dissipation, it is a tough deal to have to also keep the unit on for a while to get the best performance.ConclusionsSigh.  The best analogy I can think of here is if car owners said, \"you know, a car should have more square tires\" and manufacturers running to build cars that way.  Yes, audio folklore says feedback is a bad thing.  Well, I have news for you: distortion is really, really bad thing.  As is noise.  It surely doesn\\'t give you \"blacker background\" if it has higher noise, does it?I read some place that it has less feedback so it can deliver less phase shift.  Do folks not know that you have reflections in your room, every one of which arrives at your ears with a different delay and hence phase?  That they all mix up and as a result, the brain discards that info?  If it did not, we would go crazy trying to make sense of people talking to us in indoor situations.  Anyway, we digress.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the ARC 100.2.  Serviceability will be poor and so will the performance.',\n",

My back is still complaining....There is no benefit to having a differential power amplifier but seems like they a pair of amps are used out of phase to double the power per channel:The switchmode power supply changes supply rail on (power demand) to keep power consumption low at lower power levels (\"class H\").  In my testing, the DR2 barely got warm so the mechanism is working.Emotiva XPA-DR2 MeasurementsI was expecting good measurements but instead got this:Wow, look at the harmonic spray starting at third one.  SINAD of 64 dB ranks almost at the bottom of nearly 150 amplifiers tested:Not good.Fortunately signal to noise ratio is excellent so this is a quiet amplifier:Frequency response and crosstalk are fine:Multitone test though shows the high distortion across the frequency band:The main meal here is power into 4 and 8 ohm loads versus distortion+noise:That\\'s incredible amount of power.  Alas it is delivered with lots of distortion.  Back to the power, check out the max and peak power:And this is on a shared 20 amp 120 volt outlet.  I don\\'t think we have measured any other amplifier that comes close to this level of output.Similar story holds (good and bad) for 8 ohm:As you see the curve looks nothing like other amplifiers where they are first noise limited until clipping sets in.  Here, distortion is front and center even at 50 milliwatts!We get a look at the architecture of this amplifier by sweeping power at different frequencies:We have a constant glitch around 20 to 50 watts which I am assuming is the amplifier switching rails to higher voltage.  We also have rising distortion as seen in the previous graphs even at low power.ConclusionsAssuming I don\\'t have to carry it much, I love the build and great value as far as $/watt and maximum amount of power available.  SNR is also good so you should be free of speaker hiss.  Distortion is high though and there is no getting around it.  Will you hear it?  At 60 dB it is probably borderline for most people.I can\\'t recommend the Emotiva XPA-DR2 due to its high distortion.  Otherwise, it is a very tempting package.',\n",
       " \"A member asked me a while ago to test the ultra cheap ($18) UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier on Amazon. To make the clickbait title work , I omitted the cost of the external power supply you need to bring yourself. What you get is a three board assembly:It took less than 5 minutes to put the heatsink on the main class D amp chip and sandwich the main board with the top and bottom.  The chip used must be for smart speakers as it has voice prompts when you change inputs.  Speaking of that, it has Bluetooth (which I did not test), analog and USB in.  The little heatsink has no air flow and in testing, it got quite hot to touch at times.For testing, I used my lab power supply and set the output voltage to 24 volts (max spec).  The supply has  3 Amps max current.  Amplifier is rated for dual 50 watts at that voltage input.UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier MeasurementsI started testing with analog input with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain:Considering the price, this is not half bad:I kludged up a USB type A to type A cable and ran the dashboard test again:As you see performance is not as good as analog input.  Worse yet, just a few seconds later, it lost stability and would no longer work reliably.  If I powered it down, it would work for a second or two and then go crazy again. It may be a design issue or my setup.  Either way, I could only continue with analog input testing.Noise floor is high as you can see in the FFT graphs above:Crosstalk managed to be worse than the worst I have tested so far:Multitone shows increased distortion at both ends of the spectrum:The most important test for class D amps shows strong load dependency:So the tonality you get will depend on speaker you hook up to it.As usual, we fall way short of stated power levels:8 Ohm performance was a bit better:Response vs frequency is smooth but that may be due to high noise floor which masks distortion:Amplifier Listening TestsI hooked up one channel to my Infinity Reference 253 speaker and starting to listen.  There was a lot more power than I expectedly, likely due to only having to drive one channel.  The sound was surprisingly good until you cranked it to max volume.  Speaking of which, if I paused input, the last 25% of the volume range produced tweeter hiss that was audible to about 1 meter/3 feet.I was very satisfied with subjective performance until I landed on two clips, both of which were busy with both bass and treble notes.  On these two tracks, the sound was very distorted at almost all volume levels.  High frequencies would get gritty and distorted and bass response was bad as well.  I power cycled the unit and let it cool and it seemed to play well for a couple of seconds and then would get distorted.  It may be that the crest factor is too low causing the amp to drive hard most of the time with these two tracks.  And then it overheats and distorts.ConclusionsThe first amplifier I ever built (with my brother when we were 10 or 11 years old) was this massive board and produced only 10 watts a channel.  It also cost us many months of allowance.  Compare that to this amplifier which for the price of a fast food meal for two, gives you stereo sound that most of the time is impressively good.  If it did not distort on those two channels, I would say you could build an amp with two of them and be in business.Given the distortion/heat issue, I can't recommend the UWAYKEY amplifier.\",\n",

There is a nice network UI interface and app.Ashly NE8250 MeasurementsAll measurements are from channels 3 and 4.  Let's start with our dashboard:That is huge amount of harmonic distortion, placing the amp almost at the bottom of our SINAD list:Strangely, in a good way, noise floor is low:Frequency response droops at either end but surprisingly it is not load dependent despite being Class D design:Crosstalk is fine:Multitone shows poor performance that we would expect:You buy these amps for power so let's see how it does at 4 ohm:Ouch!  That distortion curve is crazy.  It almost act like a tube amp or something!  Distortion is so high when it clips that when we measure at 1%, we actually get less power:Switching to 8 ohm doesn't help:Sweeping the frequencies we see this pronounced hump:So my guess is that it is a class G design but company says Class D.ConclusionsThe distortion in this amplifier is just out of control.  It is also not every powerful on a per channel basis.  So I don't see it having a good application for home use in either main or sub amplifier.  It is also expensive so I don't see the value in it either.

And noise level is quite high.  Switching to USB input improves the good channel significantly:The bad channel is insisting on producing far more distortion.  Averaging the two, we get a SINAD score that is pretty much at the bottom of our rankings:From here on, I stuck with USB input since it performs better.  Frequency response was refreshingly good:Power into 4 ohm load shows poor response:Doesn\\'t get much better into 8 ohm:And we are way off the spec.  But that is typical.  Or maybe it needs the higher voltage power supply.Thermal stabilityNot much was changing after power up:ConclusionsIt is one thing to have random performance when an amp is $50 or so.

       " ' Rockville RPA16 \"Professional\" power amplifier. It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me. It costs US $390.The amp has a \"peak\" spec of 10,000 watts!  No, there is no typo in there. It weights 40 pounds/18 KG so it does have some meat to it.  You can probably see the bolt that holds the power transformer on top left. So no switching power supply at least.  Back panel shows nice sub out option:The fan is variable speed and is mostly quiet at idle.  But even under modest power it spools up as temps climb, making a slightly whining sound:The front controls are analog actually but notched, making it harder to select an exact value.  They are out of sync with each other so one notch is not the same as the other.  The displayed amount is also off by a couple of dB (27 dB shown above was actually 29 dB).  There is a built-in limiter and clipping light.Rockville RPA16 MeasurementsLet\\'s jump right in with our dashboard:That is very odd set of spikes in low frequencies.  We have the mains 60 Hz noise but also 70 Hz.  At this power level though, spray of distortion at -62 dB sets SINAD though, causing it to rank as one of the worse tested:Its score of 55 dB is so low that it pulled down our overall median by 1 dB to 78!Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts, likely due to that power supply noise.  But there is so much power that when you push it, the ratio is not bad:Multitone test shows that distortion naturally gets worse at higher frequencies:Frequency response is nice and load independent indicating a non-switching amplifier:You have a choice of two roll offs for sub output.  Strangely both boost the gain as well:Let\\'s see how accurate the power specs are (2 X 1500 watts at 4 ohm):Naturally we don\\'t get there but this is one powerful amplifier, generating nearly 1500 watts with both channels combined.Letting distortion go up and with shorter term signal we get even more of it:I don\\'t think we have measured this much power before, have we?Even at 8 ohm you have a ton of power:As noted though, noise floor is high, again, I think the worst measured.  Distortion actually doesn\\'t set in until 100+ watts.Checking for frequency vs power and distortion we see orderly response:If you are using it for sub, you want to use the above number, rather than the 1 kHz power tests shown earlier.  Fortunately this is still a ton of power considering dual channels are driven.Finally, I ran a wideband spectrum test to confirm the design is not switching:And it is not.  There is also good filtering to push the noise levels down so low above a few hundred kilohertz. ConclusionsThis is an interesting take on a pro amplifier to go with non-switching design.  This makes the amp extremely heavy compared to competition yet, the price is maintained and absurdly low.  Copious amount of power is available if you can tolerate some fan noise.Due to high level of noise I can\\'t recommend the Rockville RPA16.  But you are welcome to choose otherwise based on other factors.',\n",
       " ' Carver M-1.5t vintage stereo amplifier. It was kindly sent to me by a member.The M-1.5t came in an era where rack mounting meant serious business. As a Carver (receiver) owner myself, I remember all the advertising for the M-1.5t.  Oddly, there is no power switch anywhere:I got a chuckle seeing that monster cable tag:And found the power specs ridiculously complicated but I am sure was appreciated by the aficionadas of the amp:The front LEDs don\\'t light up until it is putting out a lot of power.  I liked the top LED which was the limiting lights and nice protection circuit which kept the unit on no matter what.  This amp was part of Carver \"Magnetic Field\" amplification line which varied the power supply voltage to substantially reduce the size and weight of the transformer.  As a result, the unit ran quite cool, maybe a bit warmer than modern class D but still, impressive for the time.The owner has replaced the capacitors in this unit.  Otherwise I think it is untouched.Carver M-1.5t MeasurementsI can see why there is no power switch as the amp did not stabilize for the 14 minutes I measured it:The level of instability is quite large, going beyond 10 db variation in SINAD!  I am used to seeing 1 or 2 dB, but nothing at this level.When I had the unit connected, and before I fed it signal, I could see constant switching noise:Not sure what that is about.  Here is our dashboard at 5 watts with 1 kHz tone:Third harmonic dominates distortion profile and with it, SINAD (relative sum of noise+distortion).  Average SINAD of 55 dB for both channels is far, far below that median for all amplifiers I have tested to date (around 79 dB).  On top of distortion, we have massive pulse train which oddly starts at 40 Hz.  So definitely not very clean.SNR though was better:Frequency response was nice, flat and extended:Crosstalk was \"OK:\"Multitone shows more than usual increase in distortion vs frequency:Front of the unit says it has low feedback which is likely responsible for this.Claim to fame is lots of power so let\\'s see how it does:We see a distinct jump in distortion at around 66 watts which must be when it switches to higher power supply voltage.  Allowing for copious amount of distortion, there is good bit of power at 273 watts.  Here is the same at 8 ohm:Now let\\'s test peak performance:There definitely is a lot of headroom, allowing power to almost double!  The 600 watt number and such must have been at higher distortion levels than what I allow.Testing for frequency sensitivity we again see the higher distortion at higher frequencies:20 Hz performance also dropped with rising distortion at just 20 watts.Finally, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:ConclusionsIt is nice to test products that were iconic during my youth with state of the art measurements that didn\\'t even exist then.  Using that, we see that in noise and distortion the M-1.5t is outgunned by vast number of amplifiers today.  However, it produces copious amount of power which would have been even more impressive then.  The efficiency rivals class D amps today which was unheard of at the time.Looking online, I see that non-upgraded but working units go for $500 or so.  They seem to be a decent alternative to pro class D amp if you have a soft spot in your heart for vintage amplifiers.  ',\n",

It is almost as large as the SA100 itself although not as thick.I was pleased that my rather large and unwieldy banana speakers securely mated with the jacks on the SA100.Overall, my impression is positive about the look and feel of this little, and I mean little, integrated amplifier.The heart of the unit is TPA3116D2  class-D amplifier IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect it is made for Bluetooth speakers and such.  In use the SA100 ran cool no matter how hard I pushed it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:As is typical of amplifiers with volume control, one can get slightly different results depending on how you set the input level relative to volume control on the unit itself.  The above is with volume control set to -1 I think.High distortion dominates the output resulting in one of the worst numbers we have measured with respect to SINAD (noise+distortion relative to main signal):Frequency response droops at both end some:The sharp drop after 20 kHz tells me that input is perhaps digitized to provide tone control?Signal to noise ratio \"OK\" for the class:Measuring distortion and noise relative to output power with 8 and 4 ohm gets us:Distortion sets it very early and climbs after that.  Specified power ratings are quite inflated as is typical of these chip amps.The sharp filter limit the measurement of harmonic distortion when we sweep frequency and power level:The red curve for example is for 20 kHz but since we can\\'t see any of its harmonics, it looks artificially low.Here is the spectrum of a 1 kHz tone without any kind of filter (the above had filters):Speaking of filter, even though I used an AES-17 filter to get rid of ultrasonic noise, the level was still so high as to confuse my Audio Precision analyzer.  It would often not be able to capture the input signal properly.ConclusionsIf we measured the SMSL SA100 on an absolute level, it would rank horribly of course.  But I don\\'t think that is proper here.  The SA100 costs so little and probably gets use in tertiary applications such as a workshop amp to drive cheap speakers you don\\'t mind getting stolen or destroyed.  And maybe for casual desktop use.',\n",
       " ' Carver Crimson 275 tube stereo power amplifier. It was purchased new by member @paulbottlehead and given to me for testing. It costs US $2750.I really like the way the amplifier looks.  The burgundy color is attractive as is the handle.  On the latter, the unit is very light though so the handle while handy, is not necessary to lift the thing.  Back panel shows high quality connectors:The tubes, four Tun-sol KT120, pair of 12AT7W and 12AX7 can in their original boxes for the owner installation. Went to open one of the small tube boxes but found nothing in it!  Worried, I looked around and it had come out of its box and was just floating in the larger box that they all came in.Prior to installation of tubes I had something to investigate: there was clearly something loose in there, rattling around.  So I took the back panel off to find a metal screw rolling around in there:Not sure where it was supposed to go.  There is a hole for something above the second fuse from the bottom but I think that would for a nut.I did not like lack of safety (earth) ground from the IEC terminal:Instead, there is some kind of local, star grounding referenced to neutral using a resistor.  That naturally won\\'t work for safety purposes.  With that power supply board mounted vertically with voltages as high as 300+ volts, I sure as heck would want this metal case grounded.  I don\\'t care what audio/electrical problem they were trying to solve there.  I want a safe product first and foremost.  Naturally there is no safety/regulatory certification which I expect a company with the name \"Carver\" to be able to afford.I got a kick out of the beefy speaker terminals but ultra-thin wires leading to it!  Yes, the lengths are short and at this wattage is probably fine but from \"optics\" point of view, you would want to use something better than hair thin wiring (see gray and red wires).I was sad to see the VU meter glued to the case:I realize welding a couple of threaded stand-offs to the case costs money but at this price, I expect such.  The meter is not backlit which was another disappointment.  But was useful for checking bias which was right at the spec at 100 milliamps.So nice looks but under the skin, a number of concerns.Carver Crimson 275 MeasurementsI usually let amplifiers warm up some and watch their behavior and also let things stabilize before measurements.  Manual states that bias can be checked after 20 minutes so I let it run for that long and a bit more:Note that the vertical scale is only 3 dB so don\\'t be alarmed by the variations.  Generally speaking, unit is table after a couple of minutes of warm up. But it is fascinating to see performance gradually get worse as it kept warming up (again, at micro level).So next comes our usual dashboard.  My Audio Precision analyzer by default has floating (non-earth connected) RCA terminals.  But I had to override that by grounding it as I observed oscillations (frequent occurrence with some amplifiers).  No other attempt at grounding made a difference in power supply/mains hum:The power supply noise really dirties up the FFT spectrum but looking past that, we see that the low SINAD (sum of noise and distortion) is dominated by distortion.  Unlike the common reputation for tubes, distortion is third harmonic for the most part, not second.  Naturally the high level of distortion places the 275 very low in our scale, second only to one other amp ever tested:Company spec is quite good for noise level relative to full power.  I could not get that without a-weighting:But applying the a-weighting filter and with it, getting rid of power supply noise, we do essentially get there:Crosstalk was poor:Frequency response has an odd shape and good bit of loss at high frequencies with 4 ohm load:Output impedance is high enough that is combining with the load to change the high frequency roll off.  Things get better as such with an 8 ohm load:There is an RC filter on the speaker terminals.  Wonder if that is what is providing the roll off.Using 32 tones to simulate \"music\" we see a high level of \"grass\" which would obscure any low level detail:Notice how the worse performance is in low frequencies.There has been controversy regarding ability of the 275 to produce its rated power of 75 watts so let\\'s start with 4 ohm load as I usually do:The amplifier produced 29 watts after which it blew its 3 amp mains fuse.  Fortunately two spares were provided, allowing me to continue testing.  Company specs distortion at \"less than 1%\" so let\\'s see power at that rating:Very dramatic difference between 1 or 2 second power (used for left side) vs short bursts.  There is clearly a capacity problem to produce sustained power.  Note that this is at 1 kHz as is industry convention.  Note that allowing just 1% THD reduces the power even more than what I allowed in my power sweep.I was surprised to not see selectable output impedance for 8 ohm load so proceed with the test as is:We blew the second fuse but now power is much more healthy at 60 watts.Hoping to not blow the last fuse, I kept the max power level lower as I changed frequencies:Performance was \"reasonable\" (for at tube) but once we got down to 20 Hz, it became super erratic and blew the third fuse.   It produced only 14 wats which is well short of 30 watts it produced at higher frequencies.  I would have wanted to test at more frequencies but it was past midnight and I did not feel like hunting around to find my own replacement fuses.ConclusionsAs a Carver owner of 40 years (solid state), I have a soft spot for the designer.  Alas, while I like some things about this amp like the nice looking paint, I am very disappointed in the QC and construction of the unit with respect to safety.  Loose screws and glued meters should not be part of a nears $3,000 amplifier.  Measured performance is awful of course and one would expect that for many audiophile tube amps.  But having third harmonic be dominant blows away the story of why that is audibly a good thing.  Clearly the specifications of the amplifier is incorrect for 4 ohm load (company even allows usage for 2 ohm loads!).  And low frequency behavior is very poor.Unless you are going to buy the Carver Crimson 275 to just look at it, I can\\'t recommend it for many reasons stated above.  I expect more from the man, the legend....P.S. It was nice to take a break from drying up our flooded home and get back to some \"normalcy\" with testing this amp.  It cheered me up to be \"working\" again and doing what I enjoy.',\n",
       " ' Carver Raven 350 tube monoblock amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and (I think) costs US $4,750.The 350 is not a bad looking amp. It has the same \"orange peel\" paint job of the previous Carver 275 amplifier I reviewed.  At 42 pounds, the unit is pretty heavy.  With all the weight in the back, the front handle is kind of useless when it comes to lifting it.There is an XLR input but I believe it is for convenience and performs the same as RCA. I measured the DC resistance of the 4 and 8 ohm terminals (after the measurements) and realized they are both the same!  Here I was switching back and forth between them.   Anyway, measured DC resistance is 0.47 ohm. The 1-2 ohm tap has a lower DC resistance of about 0.3 ohm.Unlike the 275 amplifier, the fuses did not blow and the amp survived my sweep tests.  Bias is to be set at \"80\" on the front dial and that was the case when I powered on the unit.There is a gain control but you are advised to set it to max which is what I did for testing.There is a flip switch in the front which changes the amount of feedback.  I tested the amp in both settings.Here are the specs:Carver 350 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with high-feedback performance using XLR input:There is copious amount of distortion causing SINAD to be dominated by it.  At 44.1, it ranks as the second worst amplifier ever tested:It even performed worse than the Carver 275 which had a SINAD of 46.  Switching to lower feedback doesn\\'t make things that much worse:Note that gain is reduced and therefore, volume will be different. This makes AB testing tricky.  Here is a more detailed FFT showing the small difference between low and high feedback:Notice how distortion is made up of both 2nd and 3rd harmonics so you can\\'t make the argument that it is \"2nd harmonic goodness.\"As noted, RCA performance is the same as XLR:Power supply 60 Hz noise in both cases causes severe intermodulation higher up in frequency. No amount of grounding impacted that so it is endemic tot he design.Noise performance is decent for type of amp it is:Intermodulation distortion rears its ugly head again in multitone test:I don\\'t know how anyone could hear more \"detail\" with such an amp where so much of the music signal will get lost in the distortion \"grass.\"Frequency response should be flat but it is not:It naturally will have load dependency due to output impedance.Let\\'s see the power situation as we had serious shortfall in the 275 amp:We don\\'t meet the spec there but come closer with 8 ohm:Back to 4 ohm, here is our 1% THD (double the company spec) max and burst power:We seem to get the same shortfall.  There is momentary reservoir though allowing the peak output to shoot way up.  This was not always consistent though.I also tested 2 ohm capability:You are still current limited so no more power.Changing the test frequency gives us the following power curves:There is some instability at 20 Hz and fairly significant power drop.  This points to power supply not having enough capacity as the lower frequency taxes it for longer period.  Some drop occurs in every amplifier by the way so it is a matter of how much.Finally, the amplifier warms up quickly and is pretty stable:Testing occurred after this warm up.ConclusionsWhat an upside down the world of audio is. Folks want to pay so much more to get dirtier sound.  You want dirty?  The Carver 350 gives it to you. Even at 5 watts there is copious amount of harmonic distortion.  Power supply mixes with that at such high level that it creates its own spread of distortion. A video must come with these amps that hypnotizes you into thinking you are getting great sound....I can\\'t recommend the Carver 350 monoblock amplifier.',\n",
       " ' Pass ACA Class A stereo power amplifier.  It is a DIY design by the famous designer, Nelson Pass, meant to be starter amplifier for people new to audio electronics to build.  There are many kits available. The one loaned to me from a long time friend of the forum.  The kit seems to cost around US $320 or so.The ACA sample I received comes in an attractive black case:The design is a Mosfet output stage with a single stage buffer.  Very modest level of feedback (9 dB?) is provided to keep distortion somewhat under control.  As you will see, the gain is very low requiring full 2 volt of DACs to drive it to max power.Here is the back side:I did not mess with it but I am assuming the single XLR allows bridged mono operation.Power is provided by a very beefy external switching power supply which outputs 24 volts with up to 5 amps or 120 watts.  All of that is put to \"use\" in generating copious amount of heat.  I was told by the owner to let it warm up for a few minutes.  As you will see in the measurements, this actually made the performance worse, not better.Overall, this is a very nice package if it performs.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard with 5 watt output into 4 ohm.  Normally this is well below the max power but not in this case as we see later:Gosh... What happened to aiming for high fidelity?  This is a distortion-factory if there ever was one.  The notion that it is mostly second harmonic does not hold true either.  Welcome to the bottom of our amplifier ratings:Let\\'s dig into distortion spectrum at lower power level of just 1 watt:Second harmonic is more dominant than at 5 watt but it doesn\\'t stay there that long.  Here it is at 2 watts:Our 32-tone signal resembling \"music\" paints an ugly picture as a result:I was pleasantly surprised how quiet the unit is though:Frequency response is also very well extended:You may be able to make an AM radio out of this thing.  Back to ugliness, here is our power versus distortion+noise into 8 ohm load:Oh gosh again.... Only 7 watts of power with SINAD of 38 dB?Things don\\'t get much better with 4 ohm load:We now have distortion climbing into near 10% category at max power of just 7.4 watts/channel.There was little variation of response with respect to frequency:Distortion level is so high that it is masking secondary sources of it.Making sure this unit matches the reference, I compared them to what Nelson Pass has published:We are getting very good agreement.  So this is what the unit is supposed to do.  Nelson stays with 1 watt output which shows the performance to be better.']"

       "[\" Topping LA90 Discrete balanced stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $799.The case is the same as the IC-based Topping LA90 which is fine with me given its high quality look and feel.  The power switch doubles as input selector once the unit is on.  Volume control can be bypassed using switch in the back:As before, power is provided by a hefty, 64 volt switching power supply rated at 4 amps (likely provides higher current in short bursts).  The amplifier as you see is all balanced with three inputs.  You have a selection of low and high gains (although the latter should really be called medium gain).  It can be bridged and nicely tolerates even 4 ohm loads in that mode.  Trigger is provided to enable one power switch to turn on a series of devices.Note that this is a traditional amplifier and not class D.  There is no remote so if you need that, you have to use a DAC/pre-amp with that capability.Topping LA90 Discrete MeasurementsThere is a lot to measure here given the fact that we have dual gains and bridge mode.  Let's work our way through it starting with low gain in stereo mode:Incredibly, the LA90 Discrete matches the performance of its IC based unit, landing on its perch on top of all other amplifiers ever tested:Switching to high gain costs you a few dBs but you are still ahead the competition:So feel free to use this mode.  Noise performance continues to be superb:Frequency response is flat of course and load independent:Crosstalk is better than average amplifier but is a step down from the regular LA90:Multitone showcases the superbly low distortion levels:Let's see how we are doing in power department starting with 4 ohms:We wind up good bit more power at 70 watts (vs 56 watts for normal LA90) while giving up nothing in spectacular noise and distortion department.  Allowing for more distortion gets us more power:8 Ohm performance follows the same path:Tests so far have been at 1 kHz (other than multitone) so let's vary that and see what happens:In a word, wow!  The amplifier simply doesn't care what frequency you throw out it!  This is a quite a step ahead of normal LA90 which itself was state of the art.Power on is silent but off may create a faint noise depending on your speaker sensitivity:Warm up showed one channel struggling a bit but later I found the power connector not fully tight so maybe that was the cause:Regardless, it behaved correctly after a minute.Topping LA90 Discrete Bridged MeasurementsAs with normal LA90, bridge mode still provides superb performance:The name of the game is power though so let's see what we get into 4 ohm:Notice how we get more power but distortion is nowhere to be found until we clip.Wow!  This makes a great case for using a pair of these amps.  You get so much power out of each one, rivalling much larger amplifiers.Reactive Load TestingThe LA90 has a very sharp clipping point.  This means that it goes from vanishingly low distortion to full clipping.  Combine this with aggressive protection circuit which shuts the unit off and you have the make up of a system that can't be measured in batch mode as my Powercube setup uses.  If I set the voltage for 8 ohm load, then it causes the amp to shut down when driven at 4 ohm.  Good news is that the amplifier doesn't care about reactive loads.  Here are the results for 8 ohm for example:Code:Maximum Output4/11/202312:13 AMMaximum Output Level ResultsSelected Load    Ch1 (Vrms)    Ch2 (Vrms)    8 Ohm; 60 deg Capacitive    21.2    21.3    8 Ohm; 30 deg Capacitive    21.1    21.2    8 Ohm; 0 deg Resistive    21.0    21.0    8 Ohm; 30 deg Inductive    20.2    20.3    8 Ohm; 60 deg Inductive    20.9    21.0I could not get a similar output at 4 ohm due to limitation of the instrumentation as stated above.  But if I drove the parameters manually, I could get it to tolerate reactive loads just as well.Selecting 2 ohm caused the protection circuit to kick in.  I didn't have time to mess with that.I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get this test done with the amplifier being pushed to clipping and shut down probably 50 to 100 times.  Even though the case got pretty warm, the amp continued to function without complaining. ConclusionsTraditionally in high-end audio when a company says they are using discrete designs, I get prepared for bad performance.  Topping once again proves that this is no barrier for their designers.  The discreate LA90 not only matches the exemplary performance of the IC based LA90, but betters it in power handling, producing more power (a needed feature).  Pushing noise and distortion down in our top tier performance is very hard but Topping has no problem maintaining its significant lead over even best of the best amplifiers.  Their skills and execution in this regard leaves me speechless.Needless to say, it is my absolute pleasure to add Topping LA90 Discrete to my recommended list.  Today is a happy day!  P.S.  Power amplifiers are least reliable audio products (due to high currents and voltages involved).  New designs sometimes need to prove themselves in this regard.  So if you are risk averse, please don't be the first to purchase this amplifier.\",\n",
       " ' Topping LA90 integrated amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $800.I must say, this is one interesting industrial design. Everything oozes style despite the diminutive package.  This aspect continues in the operation of the unit with the sound of the relays solidly clicking indicating something good is going to happen.  Here is the side view:While quite solid, you can pick it up with one hand.  The small size is aided by a massive external switching power supply:Here are its ratings:Back to the unit, you can see three balanced inputs.  Volume control can be bypassed although I did not do so for my testing. You can also operate LA90 in bridged mono mode.  There is also 12 volt trigger.There are to gain settings.  One at 10 dB and another at 20 dB (nominal).Topping LA90 MeasurementsThese are non-bridged mode measurements.  Bridged setup follows this section.  Let\\'s start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm in low gain mode:I don\\'t need to tell you that this is a stunning level of achievement.  We have a power amplifier producing almost the same SINAD as a state of the art DAC!  Using this number, LA90 grabs the top spot with ease with a nice gap to boot:Here it is zoomed:You might be thinking that it can only do so with low gain but that is not true.  Even in high gain performance is spectacular:It would still achieve top spot in our rankings and achieve full audible transparency.Not only is distortion vanishingly low, so is noise level:Frequency response is flat and wide as expected:Being class AB design, it has no load dependency.Crosstalk is incredibly good although it loses a tiny bit relative to last champ of amplifiers:Multitone test shows the very low distortion levels:Let\\'s see how much power we have:So power is modest in non-bridged mode.  But note how good the high gain mode is so I would feel just fine using that for operation of the unit if you need to.  Allowing distortion to rise to 1% naturally gets us more power:Here is 8 ohm:Oops.  \"High Power\" should be \"High Gain.\"Changing frequencies shows the same excellent performance:Despite being pushed deep into clipping, the amplifier did not complain until I got to 20 Hz where its over temperature shut it down.Finally, you don\\'t need any warm up:Topping LA90 Bridged Mode PerformanceA shorting wire is provided to connect the two negative speaker bindings together allowing bridged mode from the top two posts.  Here is our dashboard again:Performance is still exceptional.  Here is our SNR:Due to more power available now, we cross the amazing 140 dB SNR threshold.  What this says is that even if you play at 140 dB, the noise level will be at or below threshold of hearing!  Of course there is not enough power there to do that but basically you know that noise is not part of the equation with LA90 as even 5 watt measurement hits below threshold of hearing.We want to know the power increase though so here it is (with 8 ohm which is the minimum impedance):Now we get good bit of power at 95 watts with almost no penalty relative to non-bridged mode.  Notice the massive gap as far as noise floor relative to Purifi amplifier.Allowing for 1% distortion we get:Here is the super wideband spectrum of the amplifier while producing 5 watts:Edit:Power Tests at 2 Ohm (Stereo) and 4 Ohm (Bridged)Requests were made to test the amplifier beyond its minimum load impedance specs.  Let\\'s start with 2 ohm load while driving one channel in stereo mode.  Dashboard still shows superb performance:Let\\'s now sweep the power:You don\\'t get extra power relative to 4 ohm but the amplifier was stable and did not even go into protection. Now let\\'s switch to Bridged mode (both amplifiers driven in differential mono) and run our power sweep again:Now we see the amplifier \"doubling down\" producing nearly 200 watts into 4 ohm.  Again, the amplifier was well composed and kept driving into clipping region without complaining, or shutting down.Again, the above tests are beyond the amplifier specifications and tests I never run as such.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping engineers are bringing their expertise in designing ultra low noise and distortion in headphone amplification to power amplifiers.  As such, they have outdone every amplifier I have measured in that regard, getting ahead to capture the #1 position with a large gap to #2 choice.The amplifier is not for everyone though. Power level is modest as compared to competitors.  And you have that large external power supply.  My wish is another version of this amp with built-in power supply, motorized volume control with bridge mode standard.  For now, we need to celebrate one of the most important development in delivering transparent, high fidelity amplification to audiophiles in a very attractive package.It is my absolute pleasure to recommend the Topping LA90.  History is made on this day folks!',\n",
       " ' Hypex NCx500 NCOREx reference design amplifier. It was sent by the company and kindly assembled by our local expert, @Rick Sykora.As you see the sample is a \"monoblock\" configuration (one channel) driven by Hypex SMPS1200 switching power supply.  The only other board is the Ncore standard interface board.   The gain as set is almost 12 dB.  EDIT: see follow up below review for with buffer (27 dB gain) performance.Here is a close up:Note that this board includes a pre-amp (buffer).  I am testing per above in unbuffered mode.During use the amplifier as a whole was extremely stable and never changed its temperature, nor did it go into protection mode.  A sole XLR connection is the input to the unit.  All fits in this nice compact box.Hypex NCx500 Buffer Bypass Amplifier MeasurementsI let the unit warm up for a while but was not needed as it was stable as soon as powered up:It did reach a plateau around 11 minutes though as you see.  But note that the vertical scale is 0.1 dB.Now on to our dashboard of 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Distortion is provably inaudible at -120 dB.  A bit of noise sags that down to 113 dB which is still superb performance, landing it at #2 best amplifier every tested:Noise performance is exceptional:Even when listening to 16 bit content at 5 watts, you have an extra 10 dB of noise margin!  This is one quiet amplifier.Frequency response is wide and load invariant which is a great attribute not existing in all class D designs:Multitone test shows off its low distortion yet again:I must say, I was not prepared for the amp to beat the reference Benchmark AHB2 in noise level in our power test:EDIT: I re-ran the power sweeps again with tighter load terminals which resulted in much lower distortion levels especially at 4 ohm:Despite massive amount of power the NCx500 produces, its distortion is now close to the best we have ever measured!I updated these max and peak measurements again which produced more power:Company specs this power level even at 2 ohm so I tested that:This is one powerful amplifier!Here is our updated 8 ohm power:I was surprised how much lower its noise level is compared to Purifi 1ET400A reference design.  Maybe that amp was not running at such a low gain setting though (edit: correct).  Still, this is once again superb performance.Sweeping with different frequencies we see various distortion mechanisms kicking in (edit: now updated showing much less distortion):There is some rise in distortion with frequency but this is to be expected.Finally, here is the pop on and off noises.  Keep in mind that this is a reference design and the on/off switch turns the whole unit on and on as opposed to soft power:Hypex NCx500 Buffered MeasurementsAs noted, there is integrated buffer (pre-amp) in this module.  I activated it which boosted the gain to 27 dB.  Maximum power is now achieved at around 2.2 volts which is well within the output of many well designed DACs using balanced out.  Here is our new dashboard:Distortion has gone down a bit but we have picked up a bit of power supply noise.  Despite that hit, performance is still state of the art:As noted, SNR has gone down but still excellent:Multitone is mostly the same but impacted by the power supply noise:Frequency response is the same:As noted distortion is lower:On/Off noise is impacted a bit:ConclusionsHypex amplifiers have always enjoyed great performance in our testing.  It is wonderful to see the company innovating and increasing the performance of their high power NC500 platform.  You no longer have to compromise between available power and superb technical performance.  You can have both.It is my pleasure to recommend the Hypex NCx500 OEM amplifier module.

       " \" Hypex Nilai500DIY class D amplifier module with PS500DIY power supply. Parts were provided by the company and member @Rick Sykora was kind enough to assemble it:As indicated, the single channel amplifier is on the left and the power supply on the right. The amplifier has built-in preamp providing three levels of gain (12, 22 and 28 dB). A jumper selects the appropriate level.  At 12 dB, you need about 12 volts to reach full power which requires a pro audio interface or a pre-amp with that level of output.  The sole input in this configuration is balanced.In use the amplifier was exceptionally solid even when pushed hard.  It kept going and stayed very cool.  It is rated to 2 ohm (see measurements below).Edit: in the original review I had the top open so I could change the gain settings.  Alas, it turns out that doing so allowed some noise pick up around 10 kHz.  I re-tested with the lid closed and that issue went away.  As a results, we have slightly better performance especially in high-gain.Hypex Nilai500DIY MeasurementsLet's start with lowest gain setting:That is superb performance with distortion at or below -140 dB!  Here is the response at higher grain settings:With all thee gain settings, the amp lands in our top 20 best amplifiers ever reviewed based on combined noise and distortion rating (SINAD):Noise performance is excellent but just shy of state of the art:But gets there at full power:As we expect from Hypex, frequency response is load impedance independent:Multitone performance is excellent:Amplifier is stable on power up:Let's look at available power at 4 ohm:Looks like we no longer have to decided between superbly low noise and distortion and available power!  State of the art performance is once again achieved in low gain while still producing lots of power (342 watts).  Allowing distortion to climb to 1% naturally gives us more power (and matches company spec):We still have healthy power even with 8 ohm load:Since the amp is rated at 2 ohm, I measured that as well:There is a bit of penalty but still great performance.  Seems power supply is limiting power so you don't get more juice.I was a bit surprised at the ballooning of the distortion at higher frequencies:EDIT:There is more of a noticeable pop on power off than power on:As requested, here is the switching response:ConclusionsIt is clear Hypex is taking competition in class D amplifiers seriously responding with a DIY friend amplifier solution that has a ton of power and wonderful performance.  While we could nitpick here and there, but in the larger context of the amplifiers out there, this is a superb offering of great performance and lots and lots of power.FYI I don't have pricing for the kit.  If someone has it, please post.  I see online ads saying around $900 to $1,100 for a single channel.I am happy to add Hypex Nilai500DIY amplifier and its companion PS500DIY power supply to my recommended list.\",\n",
       " ' Benchmark AHB2 Amplifier using THX technology to reduce distortion.  I was going to request one for testing due to membership demand but to my pleasant surprise, the company volunteered to contact me and send not one, but two units!  I requested the second one because of something  I was seeing in the measurements that turned out to be my issue, not the amp\\'s.  The AHB2 retails for US $2,999 from the company direct.The AHB2 is a very compact form factor, enabled by use of switching power supply to increase efficiency/density:There is just a power switch in the front.  It might be but I constantly reached for the screw next to it to power it on!  Having the power switch be slightly different color or shape may help with this.There are a set of LEDs that show the status of the amplifier.  They are driven by an FPGA (field programmable digital logic) that monitors all aspects of the amplifier and shuts down the unit if stressed.  It did so very quickly and efficiently in my testing.  Usually this is done with purely analog or maybe a small microprocessor.  As such, the coverage of scenarios that could damage the amplifier is much less complete than using the approach Benchmark is using in AHB2.Here is the back panel:This is a very minimalistic approach given the small amount of real estate available.  Only input is XLR balanced which is just fine in my book.  A gain switch allows the input level to be controlled so that you can just use an RCA to XLR adapter and still get full power (2 volt max in high gain).  At the other extreme, the low gain setting is designed for professional pre-amps with lots of output, getting its max power at 9.8 volts.  Using this scheme, the signal to noise ratio can be improved as you will see in measurements later.For speaker terminals there are two sets: classic heavy duty banana jacks and SpeakOn.  The SpeakOn are locking and provide the best performance.  I lost about 3 dB of performance using the banana jacks due to less secure connect there.  So the measurements you see are with SpeakOn jacks.Another minor nit on that note: I had a rather cheap SpeakOn cable and its plug was just large enough to hit the silver screws that the sockets are mounted with.  Typical round shaped SpeakOn ones are not an issue.  Flush mount screws would solve this problem.There is a switch for selecting stereo or mono bridged output.  The latter quadruples the amount of power available and unlike typical bridging, according to Benchmark comes at no penalty in distortion!  I plan to test this later as it has a minimum impedance of 6 ohm so I could not use the 4 ohm setup I used for this testing.There is a very beefy AC mains cable with really nice locking tabs.  Insert it and it stays put unless you push the two red tabs on each side.  Nothing is more aggravating than the AC cable coming half-way lose from the IEC socket.Being a proper company of course the AHB2 comes with full set of regulatory/safety/emissions certifications which is super important with power amplifiers given the high voltages and currents running around in them.In use the AHB2 stays very cool for a power amplifier when it is idling, outputting little power which was a nice surprise.As to THX technology, it merges a low-power but very low distortion amplifier with a high power but higher distortion amplifier.  The distortion of the latter is not seen because it is producing so much power (so the ratio of distortion is lower).  The general scheme is not new, dating back to 1980s but new implementation is.  We have seen this in stellar performance of Massdrop THX AAA 789 amplifier which broke new ground in level of distortion and noise. Will the Benchmark AHB2 manage the same?  Let\\'s see.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my 5 watt output test using 4 ohm load using SpeakOn terminals as noted:I hope your jaw is on the floor just like mine was when I saw this picture emerge!    113 dB THD+N in a power amplifier?  Are you kidding me?Look at the harmonic distortion.  The worst case spike is below -130 dB!  This is insanely good.  Of course this type of SINAD (signal and noise ratio) crowns the Benchmark AHB2 as the best I have ever tested:The performance was so good I literally had to rebuild my dummy load to get there.  Even the quality of the metal used in the connectors matters to get to this level of distortion.  I replace all my dummy loads with higher precision ones that have much less VCR (voltage coefficient of resistance).  Resistor values can become voltage dependent creating distortions of their own.  Up to about 105 dB of THD+N, it doesn\\'t matter but beyond that, the VCR was the dominant distortion, not the Benchmark AHB2 amplifier!It was requested that I show the breakdown and distortion so here we are:Our best case hearing threshold is -116 dB SPL so no question that this level of distortion is totally inaudible.  Separating the noise from THD, we see that it is noise that we are measuring as THD+N, rather than distortion:And this is with exceptional noise performance of Benchmark AHB2 as we see in the graph of THD+N versus power:Even in high gain, the AHB2 easily outperforms the DIY Hypex NC400 I had tested before which used to be the best amp I had tested.We have 185 watts of power at incredibly low distortion of 0.00016%, besting the company specifications.Note that the FPGA protection mode kicks in and essentially shots the amplifier down past the limit.  You get absolutely distortion-less and noiseless performance until there is no more.EDIT: here is performance in bridged mode using same 4 ohm load:You get 500 watts of stunningly clean power.  Protection circuit shut the unit down after that so it is quite safe to try.  With a THD essentially matching the non-bridged mode, there is no reason to be afraid of trying this.Intermodulation distortion versus power level shows the same story of clean power:If you want to know what you get for extra money over bargain amplifiers, you can see the difference in the above graph.  We are not talking about 5 to 10 dB but whopping 40 dB better!I have had requests for intermodulation distortion using dual 19 and 20 kHz tones.  Here is that:THD+N versus output level looks far cleaner than anything I have tested before:Even at the limit of our hearing (20 kHz), we have vanishingly low amount of distortion.  The graph is exaggerated so shows a rise there but in absolute levels, despite 90 kHz bandwidth of the test, we have incredibly low THD+N of just .004%.The sharp spike at 45 Hz in green shows the amplifier going into protection mode.  So don\\'t pump that sine wave continuously into it at 133 watts.  Frequency response is exceptional too as expected:Since this is not a switching amplifier, there is no filter there allowing the bandwidth to go to 200 kHz and beyond.  Lowest band of AM radio is 450 kHz so likely you could use the AHB2 for an AM radio transmitter!  Usually when we test switching amplifiers we see all kind of \"interesting\" things in their outputs above hearing range.  The AHB2 is a classic configuration albeit, with a switching power supply so all is well and clean here:My reference graph for the Hypex NC400 used an AES filter (by accident) so I ran the AHB2 both ways, with or without that filter.  Using the filter (in green) so the two are equal, we see much cleaner spectrum below 200 kHz and of course, no massive switching spikes.  Worst case spike is below -115 dB.  In other words, the Benchmark AHB2 is clean even in the areas you are not looking!  It is like a restaurant scrubbing their parking lot with soap and pad as well as their dishes.  My loose wires on dummy loads is not the best setup for measuring crosstalk but here it is anyway:Where our hearing is most sensitive (2 to 5 kHz), separation is around 100 dB which is way, way more than we need.  Despite the small enclosure, the AHB2 manages exceptional numbers here.EDIT: forgot to run the classic SNR test in the original review:Wow, assuming you play at peak of 120 dBSPL, your noise floor will be at -10 dBSPL!  That is absolute silence.ConclusionsIt goes without saying that the Benchmark AHB2 breaks new ground with respect to performance of power amplifiers.  Using it, you can be assured that any distortion that you hear is from other sources (speaker, source, content, etc.).  This is what I look for in high-end audio: absolutely the best performance so no second guessing is involved. You buy once, and you are happy forever!All of this comes from a company that is a model of transparency with proper and accurate measurements of their products on their site.  And importantly, volunteering to have that data shown to be correct by independent sources such as us.  Support form the company for me at least has also been exceptional.Yes, $3,000 is fair bit of money but is pocket change in high-end audio.  Sales tax is higher than $3,000 for most of those products!  I hear a lot of talk from audiophiles to have the equipment get out of the way of enjoying the music.  Well the Benchmark AHB2 at levels that assuredly passes full transparency.  So if that is your moto, you better stop buying boutique products with no specs and independent measurements and get an AHB2.  Everything you hear then will be what is in your source, not the dirty dishes that your amp my serve your food on.Needless to say, the Benchmark AHB2 gets my strongest recommendation for power amplifier.  The pink panther agrees, having hit the ball out of the park after I took that shot!',\n",
       " \" Audiophonics HPA-S400ET. It was sent to me by the company after member request and costs 1 490,00 € (US $1,638).I must say this is one of the best packaging of class D amplifiers (Purifi in this case) that I have seen!  It is slick and has style.  While the heatsink on one side is cosmetic, the other is connected to the power supply power transistors although in use nothing rose above room temperature.  Back panel shows extremely high quality speaker connections:You can see it better with the lid open:I must say, this is so clean you can eat of of it!    I simply cannot find any fault with the assembly and design.  Bottom to modules are Purifi 1ET400A modules fed by their own custom buffer/pre-amp gain stage.  Jumpers let you select from different settings (see measurement section).Audiophonics HPA-S400ET MeasurementsGiven the three different gain stages, it was a challenge to decide what to test so that this job doesn't become nearly infinite in scope.  I will first show you the dashboard for all three gains starting from high gain:This is superb performance already with distortion products at -125 dB.  Channel matching is excellent.  Here is medium gain petformance:This is a nice setting as max power is achieved at 4 volts meaning you can use all of our modern/desktop amps to drive the unit and gain a bit of performance.If you have a pro interface that goes up to 10 volts out, you can utilize the low gain mode:This gain is actually close to how I measured our two top performers (Benchmark AHB2 and Topping PA5) so let's see how the Audiophonics ranks:Looking at top 20 we see:Amazing performance!  Measuring SNR at low and medium gain we get:OK, from here on I am going to stick with low gain mode.  Here is our multitone:Stellar as expected.  Crosstalk manages to actually land in #1 position of any amplifier tested:Frequency response is dead flat with no load dependency:Let's sweep and see how we do with 4 ohm load:Excellent performance.  Here is how much power we get if we allow more distortion:Switching to 8 ohm we see that the performance actually exceeds than of Purifi (although I think that was tested at higher gain):Testing at other frequencies we still have great performance:Finally, the amplifier is stable at power up so no need to wait for it to warm up:ConclusionsThe Audiophonics HPA-S400ET comes in a beautiful package with super performance to match its good looks. Yes, it builds on Purifi's excellent platform but they managed to add value without messing with its performance.  The gain settings are well thought through.  The whole thing is so well executed and must be a delight to our European members who can buy it locally.  Having been built in France, it is also a feather in the cap of our French members.  I am happy to give my strongest recommendation to Audiophonics HPA-S400ET.  You have a lot of power with superb fidelity and transparency.Edit: video review just posted:\",\n",
       " ' TP (Topping) RA3 stereo balanced rackmount amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $229.Yes, this is a new sub-brand from Topping.  I quite like it.  The large and highly visible volume level is as gorgeous to look at as it is responsive.  A remote control is provided which is something you don\\'t usually get.  The remote (or front panel) allow you to select between RCA and XLR input:For those of us who have a DAC and an analog source, this is all that we need.Lots of nice touches are there such as independent memory for the volume setting for RCA vs XLR.  Safe volume settings.  Trigger support and ability to update firmware in the future.  Love that despite low cost, the power supply is built in.  You have a hard power switch which puts the unit in standby.  Push the volume knob or the remote button and it powers on.This line of products, at least for now, will be sold by Topping direct.  Alas, it is not yet on the website so you may have to wait a bit to order it.I don\\'t know anything about the design but based on measurements below, it seems to be a highly optimized class D chip architecture.TP RA3 Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Distortion is kept below threshold of audibility at around -116 dB.  So noise is the only thing we need to worry about.  There, when combined with distortion, nicely lands RA3 in our top 20 best amplifiers ever tested:Mind you, noise performance is excellent:Survey of available music indicates best case dynamic range of 18 bits and TP RA3 gives you that at just 5 watts!  Allow it to go to its max power and it reaches 20 bits.Multitone showcases the very low distortion in mid frequencies where our hearing is most sensitive:But if you insist on pumping ear deafening high frequency tones into it in the form of 19 and 20 kHz tones, you naturally get more distortion:A concern with low cost class D amp ICs is load (speaker) dependency.  Topping has worked hard to make that basically a non-issue:Crosstalk is incredibly good, besting even our reference:Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm:As noted, measurements completely match Topping spec of 130 watts at 1% THD+N.  Not boundless power but very good for many.  Naturally we lose good bit of power if you have a rare 8 ohm speaker:Varying the frequency we do see the class D chip amp create more distortion above 5 kHz or so:There is a bit of a noise spike with power off:There is some inconsequential spikes in one channel in the first short minutes as the amplifier warms up:Speaking of that, the amplifier didn\\'t feel to be rising above room temperature in my testing -- on top anyway.Finally, here is the efficiency vs output power (per channel -- both channels driven):Idle power while on is about 9 watts. The protection circuit is aggressive in the way it shuts the unit down when pushed hard so I did not try to run my reactive load tests.ConclusionsIt is remarkable to me how Topping is not only capable of producing new product one after the other, they do so while striving for state of the art in performance.  This is so even though they are bound by the capabilities of the class D chip amplifier they are using.  I really like the larger form factor as it not only allows better dissipation of heat and inclusion of AC power supply, but also makes the unit more substantial and \"professional looking.\"  If they made the rack ears optional, they would fit nicely in a home system as well.Feature set is great for this class of product with inclusion of remote control, trigger support, nice and visible volume level, etc.It is my pleasure to add TP RA3 to my recommended list.  Incredible performance for so little money. ',\n",
       " ' Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp with the optional Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage.  With that option, the cost is £1,979.00 excluding VAT.  This translates into US $2,554.  The unit was purchased new and drop shipped to me by a kind member.  I had previously measured the reference design from Purifi so will be good to see how this version rates with a different input stage.The Nord dual monoblock comes in a very attractive enclosure (most of which is not visible in this image):Efficiency of class D amplifiers and switchmode power supply enables such slim case to be used.  There are two rows of heatsinks on the sides but they are decorative for the most part.  I will do a teardown separately.  For now, the amplifiers dissipate heat into the bottom of the chassis and dual power supplies have their own heatsinks inside the box.The back panel shows seriously beefy and nice feeling speaker connectors:When I received the unit, it immediately shut down.  The reason was a blown fuse.  I replaced it with a spare that comes in the IEC holder.  That worked for all but my last test which is the strenuous power vs frequency.  I have let Colin know that I think the fuse amperage needs to be increased given our low operating voltage in US.  Note that with music you are not going to hit this easily so it is more of an issue of lab/stress testing.  I don\\'t have a higher amp fuse to try with it until a batch arrives on Monday.  The fuse is the smaller 5x25mm which I only have a few of in low amperage (usually are used in multimeters and such).Edit: turns out the fuse that was sent for was for 240 volt countries.  A \"slo-blow\" 10 amp replacement fuse was sent and worked fine.Other than this, the amplifier was solid in its performance never shutting down or complaining.  The enclosure didn\\'t even get warmer than room temperature.  Inclusion of two power supplies here relieves my worry of a the power supply being the weak link, not the amplifier.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 Ohm at 1 kHz:This is right on the money as far as THD+N and hence SINAD:Which is great news of course.Noise performance also matched the Purifi reference design:We have a very low distortion and very low noise floor.  This is all that you would want to ask an amplifier.  That, and power so let\\'s see how it does there:Dual power supplies don\\'t give you more power as we are essentially matching the reference design with one power supply.I was surprised to see a rise in distortion with one channel worse than the other.  Is this the Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage in play or were we given better evaluation samples at announcement?  We won\\'t know until we test another amp that uses Purifi gain stage.Same issue exists at 8 ohm although not as exaggerated:This makes me think the issue may be in the amplifier.Note that this is not an audible concern so don\\'t jump off the cliff please.  We see an exaggerated version of the same in intermodulation distortion relative to input level:Frequency response is flat and similar to reference design:Sweeps of power versus frequency gives us varying curves (ideal = all curves on top of each other):We see that at 20 Hz where we need most power, we have least amount of it.  This is typical of amplifiers since 20 Hz tone changes slowly not giving a chance for power supply capacitors to recharge between cycles.Finally here is the 19+20 kHz at the same 5 watt power of Purifi reference design:The pair around the main tone are identical to reference design.  Noise floor is a hair higher but that is probably run to run variation.ConclusionsThe Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp is an attractive build of the Purifi class D amplifier technology.  The dual mono configuration raises the price fair but but my belief is that it will last a lot longer than the single power supply version.  Measured performance is just a bit worse than Purifi reference design as power increases beyond 25 watts or so.  Not an audible difference but would be good to figure out where this is coming from.  I can\\'t detect any improvement from Sonic Imagery discrete 990enh opamps.  So personally I would go with the stock gain stage and save enough money for a night out alone.I am happy to recommend the Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amplifier.  It builds on state-of-the-art Purifi amplifier modules and delivers it in nice packaging.',\n",
       " ' Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  With the options as tested, the cost is US $4,212.  As the name indicates, the amp is based on Hypex NC1200 class D amplifiers plus some value add in the form of Sonic Imagery 990Enh buffers, very fancy speaker terminals and even directional fuse from Synergistic Research!The enclosure is the same elegant design I have tested before with Purifi modules:And here is the back panel connectivity:The massive speaker terminals had no trouble handling my heavy speaker wires.The trigger input is unusual in that it is supposed to fully shut of the unit, consuming no power (?).  The amps are mounted to the bottom of the case as is typically down.  So the top got slightly warm in testing.  The bottom though was rather toasty after stress testing.  I will post a teardown later.In use, the NC1200DM never complained, shut down, or go into protection.  Even during my intensive power versus frequency that causes weaker designs to bail out, the NC1200DM cruised right on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard at 5 watts into 4 Ohms:Channel matching is quite good.Highest distortion is third harmonic at around -108 dB which mostly responsible for 105 dB of SINAD (signal relative to sum of distortions and noise).  This puts the NC1200DM near the top of our rankings:Signal to noise ratio was quite good especially near max power:32-tone signal resembling \"music\" shows exceptionally low intermodulation distortion in audible band:Most meaningful test is power versus distortion and noise so let\\'s get into that with 4 ohm load:We clock nearly 500 watts before the clipping onset.  Hypex rates the module at 700 watts which is likely at higher distortion levels (see later).  Distortion rises fairly early relative to our reference.I was surprised to once again see how quiet the NC1200DM was when testing at 8 ohms and comparing to Purifi 1ET400A reference design:Power output leaves 1ET400A behind at 270+ watts.  The cost is higher distortion.Keeping THD+N at 0.1% and sweeping the frequency we get:Now we peak at 600 watts.  Drop at low frequencies where we need power is slight (10% or so).  The sudden drop at 20 kHz is usually due to ultrasonic noise shaping and wide bandwidth of this test (90 kHz).  In real use, we don\\'t need much power at 20 kHz and at any rate, a lot more would be produced than this chart indicates.Here is the intermodulation distortion for 19+20 kHz tones for those of you who love this graph: Remember that the threshold of hearing is quite high at 19 and 20 khz even for people with healthy response up to these levels.  And at any rate, music never has full amplitude signals at these levels.Crosstalk performance was very good, stopping just short of our reference:ConclusionsThe Nord One NC1200M Signature Edition produces tons and tons of clean power with very low noise floor.  While other amps have tested with lower distortion, none come to its power output.  Audiophiles routinely underestimate how much power they need.  As such, it is great to see an amplifier produce so much power while keeping distortion and noise at bay.  I see no performance flaws anywhere.Yes, the \"signature\" components are of dubious value but they are not hurting things either.The enclosure is attractive.  And the whole package light and efficient.  My kind of design. I am happy to give a strong recommendation to the Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amp.',\n",
       " \" VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp (buffer/input gain stage).  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,090.  I just reviewed the same amp but with SIL 994EnH-Ticha Pro buffer so you can compare them. As with the other variation, I am a fan of the more slim rack mount case (it is a lot deeper than this photo shows):Back panel as expected:VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp MeasurementsLet's start with our dashboard and see if the power supply noise we had with the SIL buffer also exists here thereby telling us if the problem was that or something else:Sadly the issue remains with the noise in the FFT spectrum.  So something else is at play.  I tried to mess with grounding to see if it impacts it and it would get much worse.  At one point one channel got unstable producing variable output.  Maybe that was instrumentation error but I did not walk away with a good feeling on this.  Nevertheless, overall ranking remains quite high due to stellar performance of Purifi amplifier module itself:I am just going to post the rest of the measurements without text as they are similar as the other review:When I ran the dashboard and saw the same problems with the other VTV amplifier, I wanted to rule out instrumentation error.  So I dug up my Purifi reference design and it produced superbly clean output as it did in my original review.  While I was at it, I also ran this test (which sadly I over-wrote) and it produced similar output to this VTV amplifier.  So the choice of buffer doesn't have much impact here:ConclusionsWhen I bought my latest car, it came with a fine scratch on the instrumentation cluster cover.  Too lazy to take it back to be repaired.  To this day it bothers me when I see it even though it doesn't impact anything on the operation of the car.  Such is the case with this VTV Purifi amplifiers.  In absolute terms they land way on top of the class.  But looking carefully we see that something in the assembly and layout has caused performance to degrade objectively.  It won't impact you in any way listening to it but just like my car, it shouldn't be there.  Smaller companies building these boxes don't do any measurements and hence can't spot problems like this.  So it is partly understandable but as consumers, we get to be ruthless in our demand in best in class execution.  So I hope the company looks to resolve these problems as their prices are very attractive otherwise.I can't recommend the VTV Purifi amplifiers based on these two versions I have tested.\",\n",
       " 'The design of the Vera Audio P150/600 RS is complete. The price is 29 600 NOK exclusive tax and shipping. Due to the corona situation and a delay with chassises, it will be a while before we have a decent number in quantity. We only have a few for sales at the moment and that\\'s the reason it hasn\\'t been announced yet. But I thought I would share some details for those who have an interest.In 4 Ohm it delivers 1kW with amazingly low 0.0006% THD+N. This is bridged, but it says a lot about the performance. The \"notches\" you see in the graph below comes from our measuring equipment switching measuring area and isn\\'t able to keep up with such low numbers. The actual distortion around 50-500W is even lower. Probably down towards 0.00025%.In stereo mode it gives out 290W in 4 Ohm with the same low distortion:The linearity is also in it\\'s own class. +/- 0.025dB from 20Hz to 20kHz. -3dB at 60kHz.The noise as low as 17uV (A-weigthing):CMRR.This is something we have spent a lot of resources on. Briefly said, CMRR is the the amplifiers ability to supress noise that comes from the outside through cables. Everything over 100dB is considered expectionally good.Here\\'s the measurement of the gain adjustments. This is also something we have spent a lot of time on to get accurate.You can see that the maximum deviation is 0.01dBThe chassis of the amplifier is cut out from a whole block of aluminium and there are no visible screws or seams. It\\'s of very high quality and part of the reason our amplifier cost what it does besides extremely accurate gain adjustments, bridging option, etc.Some more info from our enigneer Armand:* We use a huge power supply of 3kW. This has plenty more capacity and runs cooler at heavy loads. It will also result in much lower distortion at low frequencies (at high loads)* Our amplifier is (as far as we know) the only Purifi model that has bridging capability. A lot of testing has been done and special considerations are in place to make this work as it should. Looking at the measurements of 1kW with 0,0006% distortion proves this is flawless.* We deliver real measurements of the whole amplifier from input to output measured with a R&S Audio analyzer. https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/my/product/upv-productstartpage_63493-7558.html.  The noise, THD+N and power delivery presented by others on specification sheets are in several cases only copied from the Purifi 1ET400A datasheet and do not tell the whole story. Internal layout, audio buffer, power supply, cooling capacity all play a role into the final result.* We use a microcontroller that constantly monitors the 1ET400A modules. Temperatures, voltages, overcurrent, clipping, error modes, etc. The RGB LED on the front will warn the user if the amplifier operates outside safe limits. Clipping is warned with RED/GREEN blinks depending on Left/Right channel. Sustained overcurrent will shut down the amplifier in order to avoid damage to speakers and warn the user with steady RED light. A yellow light will warn the user that the temperature is reaching a level that is not healthy.* We have a Auto OFF function. 3 hours without signal on the inputs will initiate a shutdown of the amplifier to conserve power and longevity of the product . (This function can be disabled by the user if not wanted)* There is a trigger input. (This automatically overrides the Auto OFF function)* All small signal levels are contained inside a well shielded small compartment in the back, ensuring low noise and excellent RF protection. The RF protection is done directly at the back of the fully shielded Neutrik XLR inputs. The XLR inputs are directly connected to the chassis to ensure short signal patc to ground.* Remote sensing of the amplifier feedback loop at the speaker terminals using a four wire system ensures the lowest possible output impedance and distortion at the terminals.Here is a picture of the internal layout. Note that this is seen from the bottom with the bottom lid off.',\n",
       " ' Neurochrome Modulus-286 Power (speaker) amplifier Kit.  It is on kind loan from company designer and member, @tomchr.  It is to ship by end of this month and costs $1,299.  See: https://www.neurochrome.com/product/modulus-286-kit-2/As you may recall from my review of Tom\\'s headphone amplifier, Neurochrome designs strive for very low distortion and good, objective performance.  So I have been quite excited and anxious to measure one of Tom\\'s power amplifiers.From the outside, the Modulus-286 is rather small but very chunky look with massive heatsinks (for its size) on each side of the unit:The heart of Modulus-286 and other solid state amplifiers Tom designs are the integrated LM3886 IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect this is from the National Semiconductor team though which was acquired by TI.The LM3886 is a pretty powerful little IC capable of producing about 70 watts at 4 ohm.  The Modulus-286 uses a pair of them to get over 100 watts of power at the same rating for each channel.  Typical of mass market amplifier ICs though, the distortion rating is nothing to write home about at 0.02% (SINAD of 71 dB).  In Tom\\'s design, an active feedback loop (i.e. uses an op-amp) brings this distortion way down as you will see in the measurements.The LM3886 is a class AB amplifier unlike other products we have tested that use much more efficient class D.  So while the LM3886 by itself is small, it requires pretty large heatsinks to cool it which is the reason for them being included in Modulus-286.  But in addition to the amplifier circuit, another source of size, weight and some heat is the power supply.  Here, Modulus-286 deviates from classic class AB designs by using a switching power supply to gain its size and weight advantage.  You can see it in the center of the Modulus-286:It is a commercial switching supply which Tom says has been customized for his use.The amplifier modules are actually hard to see on each side of the central power supply.  I tried to take a picture of them but it was hard:You can see the two LM3886 ICs mounted to the heatsink at the bottom.  I am sure there are better pictures at Tom\\'s website.So let\\'s get into the measurements and see how she does.MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my dashboard view with 5 watts of output and in this case, XLR balanced inputs:SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) breaks the 100 dB barrier which is nice.  You can see that the distortion of 0.0009% is orders of magnitude better than the specified level by TI (although that number is likely at higher powers).I noticed a lot more mains/power supply noise in one channel than the other.  Nothing I did would impact its level.  I could also feel the \"tingling\" sensation from the case which indicates mains leakage.  This is legal and safe (allowed in safety standards) but does explain the elevated levels there.  Of course at -110 dB is not audible since our hearing is so poor in low frequencies.Next, I measured the all important power versus distortion+noise:Compared to our best measured so far, Hypex NC400, the Modulus-286 nearly matches it in noise level.  On distortion, one channel also tracks the NC400 until its max power of 95 watts.  This was with 0.975 millivolts of input.  Attempting to feed it strong signal would cause it to go into protection so I could not quite get to the specified power rating.One channel deviates some though as you see in light red.  the better channel goes as low at 0.0007% of THD+N or SINAD of 103.  Seeing how this is at max power, it is very nice figure to arrive at.  Performance is basically noise dominated with no distortion until the shut down.The Hypex DIY NC400 has more power but its distortion starts to rise from where Modulus-286 stops.  It produces 226 watts at the point I have marked in blue.  So it has more headroom.Frequency response shows somewhat early roll off:We are down 0.4 dB at 20 kHz.  Would have been nice to see this flatter seeing how this is a traditional class AB design.  Likely it is part of the computation to keep the amplifier stable with different loads.  Of course not an audible concern for most of us who can\\'t even hear 20 kHz let alone 0.4 dB of drop in there.  Signal to noise ratio is quite good:Broadband spectrum analysis to 1 MHz shows very little of concern:We see some indication of the switching frequency of the power supply around 160 kHz but its level is quite low at nearly -100 dB.  With class D amplifiers we see levels as high as -30 dB!  Note that since this is a class AB amplifier, I did NOT use my AES-17 filter with any of the tests.I tested THD+N versus frequency at 6 different power levels as you see on the graph:As expected, distortion rises at higher frequencies (feedback gain is lowest there).  At 97 watts, the Modulus-286 could produce frequencies above 1 kHz but below that, it would enter into protection mode as indicated by vertical lines in orange.At the lowest power level (0.25 watt) we are dominated by noise and hence the elevated line in red for that.  That is true of any power amplifier.Finally here is the crosstalk for one channel (the other is better):Please take this as worst case response.  I am testing the amp using a bunch of wires everywhere which can impact crosstalk (and noise levels at low amplification).  I need to build a dedicated module with tight wiring for tests like this.  Regardless, numbers like this are amply good enough as far as audibility is concerned.ConclusionsThe Neurochrome delivers good power with very low distortion using a combination of active feedback and off-the-shelf amplifier IC.  Use of a switching power supply keeps costs, size and weight down.  It produces nearly 100 watts of very clean power into 4 ohm load.  Personally I like to have much more power than that.    But if you have subwoofers, or don\\'t listen as loud and/or have more efficient loudspeakers, you should be fine.I am not sure what value judgement to put on the amplifier.  Certainly at $1,300, the Modulus-286 amplifier is \"cheap\" compared to any high-end amplification.  At the other externe, the DIY Hypex NC400 I tested produced more power at I think $1,500.  Purchasing the Neurochrome Modulus-286 would let you support a smart, Canadian designer and entrepreneur.  I let you decide how valuable that is.Overall, I can recommend the Neurochrome Modulus-286 as a well-engineered product with no design faults.',\n",
       " ' NAD M27 7-channel surround audio amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Seems like the M27 came out back in 2014 and costs US $4,400.The M27 has the same design language as the excellent M17 Home Theater Processor (looks only):The enclosure, especially the top surfaces, oozes quality and luxury in the way that many high-end audio companies fail at.  And the looks are actually functional with ample ventilation holes for proper cooling.  I will do a teardown later to show this in more detail.One strange bit of functionality is that the NAD logo lights up orange but goes off when the amplifier is turned on using the touch button on top.  This is backwards but fits the functionality for home theater use in darkened room.The rear panel takes the high quality look of the front and top to the back:Everything from XLR connectors to speaker terminals is stout and feels solid.In use, the amplifier when driven in two channel mode, never came remotely close to complaining, shutting down, etc. which I frequently see in AVRs.Heat dissipation at first is very modest but after half hour of use, the idle power consumption of the rest of the unused channels served to warm up the top.  No worries though as it was not remotely \"hot.\"  This is due to use of switching power supply (single one powering all the channels) and class D amplifiers based on design from Hypex nCore series.  The actual implementation is custom which I will show in teardown.For my testing, I focused on XLR input only.  I hope if you buy an amplifier of this class, that is the connection you use.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard, driving two channels into 4 ohm at 5 watts:Ah, what a relief it is to see excellent SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) in home theater space after testing so many subpar amplifiers in AVRs.  Distortion products are around -110 dB.  Ironically, this is far better than the processor and AVR DACs we have tested.  In 2-channel world, our desktop class are usually way ahead of amplifiers but not in home theater.  So far anyway.The very nice showing in noise and distortion puts the M27 amplifier near top of the class:Spectrum of 1 kHz FFT shows the typical switching frequency in 400+ kHz:Here is the frequency response:There is a kink in there around 50 kHz but seeing how it is way out there as far as audiblity, it should be OK.  May differ though with a real speaker load.Crosstalk is very good:Dynamic range at around rated power is excellent (better than 20 bits in digital terms):Even at rated power you have 105 dB or 17.5 bits.Most important test is THD+N (distortion+noise) relative to power level as we increase input.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Wow, this is one powerful beast in stereo mode.  Courtesy of a power supply that is designed to feed 7 channels, it is not a bottleneck in 2-channel mode allowing these class d modules to sing.  And sing loud!8 Ohm output is also quite good:Of course in neither case we are able to match the state-of-the-art 2-channel amplifiers from likes of Benchmark or Purifi.  But what is there at -90 dB or better should be quite excellent.Peak power as you can imagine, is even higher:Here is a refined version of a recent test: I sweep for power using different frequencies from 20 kHz on down to just 20 Hz.  Test bandwidth is 45 kHz so that it allows enough harmonics to be included in the test but not too much that it just shows ultrasonic noise-shaping and such:As expected, at low frequencies we have lowest distortion (lowest graphs) but we clip due to much larger power demand of these \"slow\" waves.ConclusionsThe NAD M27 surround power amplifier has exceptional looks and build quality.  It is beautiful to look at.  That beauty runs way deep into its veins, producing lots of power in a class-leading way.  Efficiency of class-d power amplifier and switching power supplies serve to keep the unit quite cool for its power rating and number of channels.  Great attention has gone into heat management and signal flow -- something I don\\'t normally see in DIY hypex ncore builds.Yes, at US $4,400 it is not cheap but you are getting 7 channels of amplifications.  That is roughly $630/channel which is actually quite competitive.I am happy to give the NAD M27 one of my highest recommendations.If you have a home theater and want a gorgeous, powerful and performant multi-channel amplifier, your search is over.  Get the M27 and worry about money for food later.',\n",
       " \"This is a write-up and detailed measurements of the March Audio P122 class D Hypex based stereo power amplifier.  It was sent to me by the company (@March Audio).  The P122 costs US $750. Due to my relationship with company owner, I won't be performing a review or providing a recommendation one way or the other.  So don't look for panthers on pictures either.The P122 uses similar packaging to the rest of March Audio products:There is just a touch button that turns the unit on and off (really on and standby).The back panel has very nice and really long speaker terminals:In use, the P122 never complained or get warm.  It passed all the tests without going into protection mode.Power supply is switching as noted on the unit so works as is worldwide.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:As noted on the THD+N panel, performance is roughly the same as the spec in one channel and slightly better in the other.  Distortion and noise combined is near top of class:Signal to noise ratio is excellent:Crosstalk is respectable as well:Frequency response is good but not flat out to infinity as some amps are:Multitone test shows a few odd spikes in mid frequencies:But levels are nearly 100 dB down so not a cause for concern.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet's start with 4 ohm:We are a bit shy of the specification on power but distortion and noise is much better than typical mass market product.  Same is true of 8 ohm load:Not sure what explains the shortfall in power. These amplifiers have regulated switching power supplies so usually don't produce more power than continuous:ConclusionsWhile the power level is on the low side, the performance is much better than typical brand name amplifiers.\",\n",
       " ' ATI AT522NC Stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 522NC costs US $2,195 but I see it on Amazon for US $1,995.  The AT522NC is part of a series which starts with 2 channels of class D amplification and goes up to 4 channels in the same enclosure.The industrial design of the AT522NC has some unique touches, some of which work, some that don\\'t:The part that detracts is ironically the ATI logo.The power button has a very nice feel and gives one impression of quality.Looking at the back, I was surprised by choice of input power connection:It is a 20 amp IEC connection rather than the most common, 15 amp variety.  This is partially due to use of linear power supply and massive/heavy toroidal transformer.  But the most common reason is that the same setup is used in higher channel count amplification.The amplifier is on a vertically mounted hypex NC-500 class D amplifiers with their own heatsinks.  The \"motherboard\" has the power supply components.  Overall, it seems like a very neat and logical design.The speaker connections are of course very secure and high quality as can be expected in this price range.  Great to see balanced XLR inputs which is how I tested the unit.In use, there was barely a heat rise in the enclosure and the unit never shut down or complain even in the face of severe clipping.   The large feet allow better convection cooling which is appreciated.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone, at 5 watt into a 4 ohm load:The use of linear power supply has its price in the form of power supply spurious tones (60, 18, 300 Hz, etc.).  The dominant distortion peak is third harmonic at a bit less than 100 dB.  Add some noise to it and SINAD (THD+N inverted) becomes around 98 dB.  This places the ATI522NC well above average of all the amplifiers we have tested:It sits just to the level of NC500 from Nord.  Those of you who keep track of such things , I am sure will compare and contrast how it does relative to other Hypex based implementations.Signal to noise ratio is good reaching excellence at full power:Frequency response is orderly for a class D amplifier which needs an output filter to truncate switching frequency:32-tone source trying to simulate \"music\" shows very low levels of intermodulation distortion:But for a peak at 60 Hz (typo in the graph), the distortion-free range is 110 dB or about 18 bits.Crosstalk is also very good:Most important data is power into 4 and 8 ohm versus distortion and noise.  So let\\'s start with 4 ohm:So not class leading but low distortion while providing 300 or so watts before sudden rise in distortion.  Spec is higher but one can have more data points at the limit and gradually walk up the curve, and hence squeeze out a few more watts.  I will show this later.For 4 ohm load, here is the comparison to our state-of-the-art in class D amplification in the form of Purifi reference design:Purifi maintains the lead in distortion but produces a bit less power.I was able to run my tough test of THD+N at 0.1% versus frequencies.  Some amplifiers have died trying to run this test.  Others are had to poinpoint as their distortion jumps all over the place:We see that at 1 kHz we normally measure, power is almost near max.  Above that we reach nearly 360 watts.  At 20 kHz though, distortion shoots way up and we are able to only produce 22 watts before THD+N of 0.1% is hit.  Fortunately there is not much music energy there so practical audible concern is low.I made a survey of a few of the tracks in my music library.  Peak energy seems to hover around 40 Hz.  For that reason, I have started to measure amount of power at 40 Hz and here, we have 316 watts which is good.Finishing off, switching frequency is around 400 kHz:The noise doesn\\'t scale with power though.  Plotting the same at max power with source frequency of 40 Hz gives us this:And intermodulation distortion using 19+20 kHz at 5 watts output into 4 ohm:ConclusionsThe ATI AT522NC seems like a solidly built amplifier based on Hypex NC500 modules.  ATI builds amplifiers for many other companies and this competence shows up in this review.  Performance is of course limited by what the NC500 module can do.  Use of linear power supply defeats the size and weight advantages of common class D amplifiers.  It may provide better peak power rating -- something I wanted to test but forgot.  Overall, I can recommend the ATI AT522NC stereo amplifier.',\n",
       " ' NAD M28 Multichannel amplifier based on Purifi Eigentakt technology.  It was kindly purchased by a member from a local dealer (Gig Harbor Audio) and sent to me for testing.  The M28 costs US $4999 through its dealers.As with the M27 amplifier I reviewed, the M28 comes in the same gorgeous industrial design:At nearly 50 pounds, this is a heavy amplifier likely due to the weight of the enclosure as the class D amplifiers and it switching power supply are light.The one thing I am not a fan of is the touch on/off button on top.  It is not responsive.  I wish the NAD logo was a hard switch.The back panel shows how you do a first class job of termination:I have kind permission from the owner for a teardown so look for that soon.EDIT: Tear down is now here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...28-7-channel-purifi-amplifier-teardown.15981/Amplifier MeasurementsThe Purifi 1ET400A that the NAD is based on scored a SINAD (sum of distortion and noise) of 104 dB.  Let\\'s see we get that from M28:Oh no!!!  Distortion has risen by 15 dB but thankfully it is below threshold of audibility.  Noise however, has degraded fair bit, sinking SINAD by the tune of 6 dB.  There is also good bit of variability with the SINAD measurement constantly changing 1 dB or more.  As it is, the M28 slips in performance even relative to last year\\'s M27:For a clue of what may have happened we can look at the amplifier gain which is now at 29 dB versus reference design\\'s 27 dB.  Given the anemic output of AV products from their pre-outs, I can see why NAD opted to do this but whatever the reason, noise performance has suffered.  We can clearly see this in signal to noise ratio:As noted, we have dropped 5 dB in noise performance which more or less explains the similar drop in SINAD.  This is a shame as noise can be audible unlike low levels of distortion.  Fortunately we still clear my hurdle of 96 dB for 16 bit content even at 5 watts so practical consequence will be small.Before someone asks, here is the dashboard with RCA:Thankfully performance is similar.Frequency response is good and matches the reference design:Crosstalk performance was superb:You buy a power amplifier for \"wattage\" so let\\'s see how the M28 performs into 4 ohm load:Gosh, not only do we have higher noise level but also much higher (in relative terms) distortion as power output increases relative to reference design.  I did not want to believe this so to confirm my setup, I pulled the reference design and measured it again and its performance was unchanged (green).  So this is definitely a degradation in M28 design.We can see similar issue with IMD intermodulation test:Fortunately as noted, we do get more power than the reference design which was likely limited by its power supply.Letting distortion climb up to 1% produces more power naturally:Interesting to see that burst power is actually a bit lower!  The test attempts to change output power until it achieves 1% THD+N and it must have reached that at that lower power.  I wonder if the sudden burst on the input increases distortion a bit.  It is an engineering curiosity than anything else.Switching to 8 ohm load we get:We again have lower performance compared to reference but the gap is lower.With AVRs, we see power reducing as we increase the number of channels.  Not here:This is excellent and shows the value of high efficiency amplification and power supply.Sweeping at different frequencies shows some small oddities but nothing of major concern:Note that our normal testing for power per industry standard uses 1 kHz but the most need is at lower frequencies.  For that reason, I have started to annotate power at 20 Hz as seen above.  All amplifiers I have tested reduce their power at low frequencies.EDIT: per request here is multitone test:ConclusionsWithout context, the NAD M28 would get very high praise from me.  Alas, taking a reference design and reducing its performance is not going to put me in that mood.  This is the cost of manufacturers not providing detailed specifications/measurements like I am providing.  If they had done that, their marketing department would immediately see that they have taken a step back and push engineering to do better. In absence of that, the \"Eigentakt\" label is plastered in the marketing material and celebration begins.What NAD has done is taken a superior amplifier design and brought its performance below that of older Hypex technology.  And charge $600 more for the privilege.  Not right.On the glass half full side of the argument, this is a beautiful amplifier, superbly crafted with excellent performance and tons of power.  I looked and could not find any M27 for sale anyway so M28 it is.I am going to of course put the M28 on my recommended list.  Just no celebration.  NAD, you could have done better.',\n",
       " ' Buckeye Hypex NC502MP 8-channel class D amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $2,295.There is not a whole lot to look at here.  Sheet metal is rather thin and fitment not that great.  So put it in a cabinet and forget about it.  The backside shows the expected including trigger control to sequence powering up multiple units with one stroke:I was surprised by the weight of the amplifier. Mind you, it is far lighter than a class AB amplifier but it is still not light.  The reason for that is that each amplifier module has a large vertical heatsink with quite stout mounting bracket tying it to the chassis.If you are not familiar with Hypex NC502MP, it is an all-in-one high power stereo amplifier with on-board switching power supply and input buffer.  Supply the connectors and you have a complete amplifier.  In this case, four such modules are included to get to 8 channel.  Due to large amount of power these amplifiers can produce in tandem, dual AC inputs are provided.  The amplifiers are split between the two AC inputs.  If you don\\'t need continuous power, you can connect both inputs to the same power strip which is how I tested it.Buckeye Hypex NC502MP Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard by measuring one amplifier module\\'s dual outputs:Performance is very good as we expect from Hypex modules.  A minor issue was the power supply spikes in one channel (blue). I tested all the amplifier modules and they all do the same thing.  So likely is due to leakage from the onboard power supply bleeding into the more adjacent channel on NC502MP.  Using the \"good\" channel on each board removes that bit of bleeding:Using the former SINAD for ranking, the amplifier nicely lands in our \"excellent\" bucket:Here is all of them in that category:Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and changing the load has no impact on output:Multitone shows the superb performance, albeit somewhat worsened by the less good channel:Noise performance is extremely good:My target is 96 dB at 5 watts which the Buckeye nicely exceeds.  And provides full transparency up to reference level of 120 dBSPL.Crosstalk naturally is beyond approach if you use two separate modules but even in the same module, it is excellent:Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm using channels in the same module or two separate ones:As you see, there is no difference.  You are only limited by how much AC power you have as power supplies are not shared.Max and peak power is impressive:We are talking nearly 1.3 Kilowatts in stereo!  Needless to say, if you are going to have all 8 channels whaling, you better have good amount of current on dual AC lines.  And make an appointment at your ear, nose and throat doctor because hearing damage is most likely!Measuring response at 8 ohm gave me a really hard time:Reason being that online specs from Hypex does not show that hump from 10 to 100 watts at all.  I tried everything from testing my instrumentation to measuring every amplifier module and still got the same results.  I shared the graph with Buckeye only to be told there is updated measurements from Hypex showing the same hump.    While performance is superb up to about 8 watts, I wish that the hump wasn\\'t so pronounced.I was most impressed by the ability of these modules to drive down to 2 ohms with both capacitive and inductive loads:It produces the same 53 volts no matter what!  At 1 ohm though, it instantly went into protection but recovered very quickly.This is one powerful and robust amplifier!Finally, you don\\'t really need to warm it up:FYI, I left the unit on overnight and in the morning, the top was warm especially in the center.  All the amps combined, do generate some amount of heat so best to not leave it on if you don\\'t need it and provide good ventilation.ConclusionsThe Buckeye NC502MP is a perfect amplifier for home theater duty. It provides incredible amount of power from each module to drive even the most inefficient speakers to ear piercing levels.  It does so with extremely low noise and excellent distortion at modest levels.  At higher powers, distortion does climb.  While I wish this was lower, I don\\'t think there is an issue at all for home theater applications.  Even with music, I think you will be fine but the purist may want to have better.  Then again, if you are going to lose power to get there, this amplifier may be a better choice.I am going to put the Buckeye NC502MP 8-channel amplifier on my recommended list.EDIT: teardown now posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?reviews/',\n",
       " \" Buckeye Hypex NC502MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased and drop shipped to me by our dear moderator, @AdamG247.  I don't know what it costs.Not sure what there is to say about the case:Or the back panel:Other than the fact that it has trigger switch and that the XLR connectors are upside down.  You need to use two hands to unlock and then pull out the cable.  And heaven help you if you don't know there is a locking tab underneath and you keep trying to yank out the cable anyway! In use, the amplifier is very robust, going into and out of protection with no shut downs (when overdriven).  Note however that once it starts to clip, there is a high pitch whine from the power supply inductors.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started my testing with the amplifier module all the way to the left in the picture above (opposite of AC input).  Here is our warm up graph:Was glad to see the unit stabilize in a couple of minutes so I did not have to wait forever.  Once there, here is our dashboard:I don't know what is going on with the channel in blue producing a lot more power supply noise (relatively speaking).  Grounding made no difference.  As a result, one channel is 3 dB better than the other.  Averaging the two still lands the amp into our upper tier of all amplifiers tested to date:Despite the power supply issue above, signal to noise ratio is excellent and superb if driven to max power:Frequency response shows no sign of load dependency which can be common in class D amplifiers:Multitone test gets polluted by the aforementioned power supply interference:Crosstalk was not as good as I expected although in grand scheme of things, it is not bad:Let's see how much power this thing can pump out starting with 4 ohm load:We have more distortion than I like but that comes with a ton more power than our more accurate but less powerful amplifiers.  Allow 1% distortion and we get even more:Very impressive considering that you have 6 channels in this lightweight enclosure!As noted, power did not increase when I split the measurement between two independent modules at each end of the case. This indicates we are amplifier limited, not power supply (each module has its own power supply).Switch to 8 ohm we get better noise and distortion although the main issue is still there:Multichannel PerformanceI thought I was all set for measuring more than 2 channels only to find out the balanced cables I had bought had the wrong gender.    So all I could do was drive 3 channels at once:What you see is the same stereo pair measured with and without the extra channel also being driven (not shown in the graph).  There is no impact at all which makes sense as these are independent modules and nothing but the power cord is shared between them.Looking for consistency between the modules, I measured each one separately:ConclusionsWhile still way ahead of countless amplifier designs, the Hypex NC502MP modules are built more for power than ultra low distortion.  Not a bad compromise considering the fact that running out of power is quite audible and rise in distortion probably not.  Beauty of class D amplification is showcased by Buckeye in producing six times 600 watts of amplification in a light, and compact case.  I will do a teardown later but so far, I am happy with what is there, sans the upside down XLR connectors.EDIT: Teardown posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...ypex-nc502mp-multichannel-amp-teardown.27648/\",\n",

Input is only balanced XLR as you see.  I believe the heart of the unit is Hypex NC122MP.boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2 MeasurementsThe unit stabilized quickly with its performance hardly changing (I optimized the cabling after this measurement so don\\'t worry about channel difference):Here is our dashboard:This level of distortion and noise (SINAD) nicely landed the amp into our \"excellent\" category:Signal to noise ratio was excellent, achieving better than CD dynamic range at just 5 watts of output:Typical of Hypex amplifiers (in a good way) is lack of load impedance dependency which plagues many budget class D amplifiers:The 2408/N2 achieved one of the lowest crosstalk I have measured:Multitone results are very good as well:Let\\'s see how much power we have:Not a ton but it is above average as far as noise and distortion.  Allowing a bit more distortion we get:Which is right on the money as far as company specifications.  Here is 8 ohm performance:Checking for frequency dependence we see well behaved response:But note the loss of power with 20 Hz input.Finally, here is the switching and ultrasonic performance:I checked the unit for temperature after all the test and could barely feel any rise above room temp on any of the surfaces.ConclusionsThe Arthur 2408 comes in an attractive and differentiated package with very high quality connectivity.  Measured performance is hugely above average although not state of the art.  I could not find any weakness in its performance no matter which way I measured it -- a sign of excellent engineering.

Did plan to test the rest of the channels for total power but forgot that I had no way of generating that many balanced outputs so what you are about to see is for stereo only.  Seeing how the amp modules are stereo anyway, this should be representative of what you get even if turned on the rest of them at full power.KJF MA-01 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:We expect excellent performance from Hypex and we get it there, producing well above average SINAD which represents level of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is very high indicating a very quiet amplifier:32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" shows very low distortion as well:Frequency response is essentially flat with almost no dependency on whether I used 4 or 8 ohm test load:This means the frequency response should not change much when you switch one speaker for another (an issue with cheap desktop amplifiers).Crosstalk is very good:The meat of an amplifier review is the amount of power versus distortion+noise so let\\'s start with 4 ohm:Spec is 250 watts which is what we get if we allow more distortion than I do in the above graph:Seems that the power supply is designed to power the amp exactly as specified and no more and hence the lack of increase on bursts (above right).Switching to 8 ohm we get:I like the lower noise with 8 ohm better than 4 ohm.Finally, there is a bit too much disturbance when we change frequency and sweep for power than I like:But as noted on the graph, there are far worse examples.ConclusionsThe hypex NC252MP stereo amplifier modules do their job to product above average performance while running cool and efficient.  While I have not yet looked inside the KJF amp, from the outside it seems like they have not done anything to lower the performance of these nice modules.I am going to put the KJF MA-01 with Hypex NC252MP on my recommended list.Edit: see teardown here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...ma-01-hypex-nc252mp-amplifier-teardown.22770/',\n",

Protection circuit is robust and auto recovers from overloads.If you are not familiar with my amplifier measurements, I highly suggest watching this video on amplifier measurements.AUDIOPHONICS MPA-S250NC MeasurementsLet's start with our dashboard:That is very competent performance as far as noise+distortion (SINAD):Zooming in:Noise performance is excellent:Class D designs can suffer from load dependencies but we can count on Hypex modules to be free of this:Crosstalk is very good despite both channels being on the same module:Multitone test showcases the low distortion:Dual tone 19+20 kHz shows the same:Only a couple of sidebands are visible at -98 dB and lower in audible band.Power curve was very clean with 4 ohm load:But strangely rose a bit with 8 ohm load:Back to 4 ohm, we almost get the specified level of power:I was pleased with rather smooth power vs distortion vs frequency:The MPA-S250NC passed my stress test with reactive loads of 4 and 8 ohm but shut down into 2 ohm:There is fair bit of pop on and off noise:Finally, the amplifier is stable and ready to go on power on:ConclusionsAudiophonics has produced one adorable stereo amplifier!  I just want to sit there and look at it.    Fortunately beauty goes beyond the skin, sporting a performance Hypex class D amplifier, producing top class results in all the measurements.  You get near state of the art performance at bargain prices with scant space needed to dedicate to the amplifier.I am happy to recommend the AUDIOPHONICS MPA-S250NC.  Can't stop smiling.....  \",\n",
       " ' JL Electronic\\'s (JLE) Sylph-D200 stereo amplifier module built on top of TI\\'s TPA3255 amplifier IC.  Depending on the configuration you pick, the module costs US $130 to $170.  You can read more about it here: https://www.jlelectronicsph.com/product/sylph-d200-tpa3255-pffb-stereo-ready-to-run-amplifier-module.  Or ask questions from the company representative @jlesterp.Testing bare modules is difficult for me so I asked for a finished system and that is what I received:Not much to see here so let\\'s look at the module inside:I must say that row of inductors looks pretty lined up that way.    I should note that the company is an ODM (white label designer) for other companies and is located in Philippines.  They provided their own measurements that correlate well with mine.There are two power supply configurations.  The version I have is the lower voltage one (36 volt?) that produces lower power than than if you choose to power it with 45 volt rails.JLE Sylph-D200 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:The gain is rather low compared to 29 dB that I usually see in amplifiers.  Then again this allows full power at the levels that our desktop DACs produce so it is fine.  I understand the base gain in the TI chip is lower still.  A buffer opamp is used to get up to 14 dB.  The lower gain gives an advantage to this board when it comes to other amplifiers which have more noise due to higher gain.  Still, let\\'s do our usual SINAD comparison:The board is just 0.1 dB short of falling in our superb category in blue!  I am told that there is a bit of SINAD loss at the speaker terminals as opposed to the board itself. If so, this is a remarkable achievement.Noise performance is excellent but again, keep in mind the lower gain:At 5 watts, it easily clears my 16-bit/96 dB hurdle.  This shows that we can build more optimized systems if we take full advantage of the output of our DACs with amplifiers that have lower gain.  The board can be configured with the feedback including the output filter or not.  The configuration I have has it including the filter which reduces load dependency but does not eliminate it:Multitone test shows the classic rise of distortion with frequency:Crosstalk performance was very good:Power sweep into 4 ohm load shows very low and interestingly, constant distortion ratio until hard clipping:Company thinks the input buffer is overloading.  As noted, to get more power you need to step up to higher voltage power supply.The hard clipping made it hard for AP software to properly determine the 1%THD point but did show the burst power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Testing for frequency sensitivity we see that behavior is decent:ConclusionsIt is amazing to see the progress these \"chip amps\" are making in the hands of capable designers.  They are inching their way to the top of the class in our distortion and noise rankings while keeping costs very low.  In the case of JLE, it is nice to see a design from another part of the world making it easier to access DIY oriented hobbyists to access them who are locally situated.  Interacting with member @jlesterp has been a delight as well.I am happy to recommend the JLE Sylph-D200 amplifier module.',\n",
       " 'This is the measurements of the March Audio P502 class D amplifier based on Hypex (?) modules.  It was kindly send to me by a member for testing.  The P502 costs US $1,075 from the company direct.This is not a review because the @March Audio is a long time member of the forum and I like to avoid conflict of interest.The unit comes in attractive aluminum packaging:On off control is a touch button which is unusual in power amplifiers.Here is a shot of the back:In hard use, the bottom plate gets quite warm.  Make sure you have plenty of ventilation from below.  A taller set of feet would help with this.My heavy stress test of frequency versus power caused the unit to shut down momentarily.  I did not retry it as I don\\'t want to risk damaging the unit.Warm Up TestAs is my standard practice now, I warm up and measure distortion and noise until the device stabilizes.  For amps, I do this at 5 watts.  Here are the results:As you see the channel in red is having a harder time, showing fair bit worse performance than the other.  It did improve momentarily after power up but then went back to the same state.  I checked all of my cabling and it was all secure.  So don\\'t know if this is an assembly issue or sample to sample variation.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Per warm up test, we see one channel with higher noise floor and differing distortion products.  Averaging the two channels still puts the P502 well above average amplifier:Frequency response was essentially flat in audible band with a resistive dummy load or my speaker simulator:Crosstalk was good enough and predictable:32-tone test simulating \"music\" shows that 1 kHz is actually the point of higher distortion.  Below and above performance improves:Signal to noise ratio is quite good:Except for the one channel lagging behind.  We are talking about 16+ bits at 5 watts reaching up to nearly 20 bits at full power.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet\\'s start with 4 ohm load:That is a ton of power with very low distortion.  Letting the distortion go up to 1% gets us even more:Switching to 8 ohm load we get:ConclusionsLots and lots of power in above average performance and small package.  If you are going to drive a sub with it at full power, you may want to deploy more cooling/ventilation on the bottom.',\n",
       " ' IOM NCore Pro, Hypex NC252MP class-d based stereo power amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs €669 from the company website.The IOM Ncore Pro comes in very compact and solid enclosure:The on/off button feels very good but I find the fonts very cheesy.  That same theme continues in the back:I could not even read those fonts on the gain toggle switch until I took the above picture! Great to see XLR balanced inputs in addition to RCA.  Note the unusual, horizontal placement of the left and right speaker terminals.  I am used to them being stacked vertically when they are so close to each other.In use the top of the amp barely increased in temperature.  The bottom was a bit more warm but nothing remotely of any concern.  There were no shutdowns.  However, I did not try to stress load it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt into 4 ohm test.  I chose the XLR input and low (XLR) gain for all of these tests:The SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) of 94 dB places the OMI Ncore Pro in the upper tier of amplifiers/AVRs tested:Which was a relief after testing a number of home theater amplifiers that stacked on the right of the graph.Frequency response is dead flat but not super wide:Signal to noise ratio at max power output before clipping into 4 ohm was quite respectable:Here is the intermodulation distortion at very high frequencies (19 and 20 Khz tones):You have well over 16 bits of distortion free at modest listening levels.  Keep in mind that your music never has such high amplitudes at these frequencies.  So in practice, the distortion will vanish into noise.Crosstalk performance was excellent:The meat of any amplifier review is power versus distortion and noise.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Shame to see the early rise in distortion starting at 20 watts.  That aside, you have considerable amount of power clocking at 236 watts, both channels driven in this tiny enclosure.Switching to 8 ohm load we get:Now the early rise in distortion is more modest.  We get 125 watts of power at a SINAD of 91 db.  Interesting to compare it to Purifi 1E400A which produces similar power but a whopping 130 dB SINAD or 40 dB better!Peak power is sadly not much more than steady state due likely to regulated power supplies:Good thing the baseline level of power is quite good.ConclusionsThe IOM NCore Pro amp is a solid performer courtesy of competent hypex NC252MP class D amplifier modules.  The packaging is nice and tidy and the price seems reasonable to me.No, you are not getting state of the art performance.  That is in another category altogether.  But that level of performance will cost you more money and comes in a larger package.Overall I am happy to recommend the IOM NCore Pro amplifier. ',\n",
       " \" Buckeye Hypex NC252MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It costs US $1149 as of this writing.  The owner/builder is @Buckeye Amps on our forum.The looks are fine for a well-priced build:The unit is quite light courtesy of rather thin sheet metal.  I am not as worried about the top being thin but the bottom is as well and that is where heat is generated.  You won't likely push all three modules to max but if you did, I would put taller feet under it and maybe even some temperature controlled fans.  In my testing the bottom just got a bit warm so not a major concern.Back panel shows standard connectors plus the trigger input:I stopped using my Mogami Gold XLR cables because I wanted to have colored ones.  I bought a batch from Amazon that is nice and flexible cabling but some kind of generic XLR connectors.  I have found them to be a hair worse than my Mogami cables as far as fit.  On the Buckeye amp though, I could barely get them into the XLR connectors and then back out.  I tried other XLR cables and my other generic ones were also stiff.  The Mogami cable however, was a bit tight but nothing as bad as my generic ones.  I know tolerances very but I had not seen this level of compatibility before with any other gear I have tested.  Anyway, it is a one-shot deal so not a big deal even if the problem exists.Buckeye NC252MP MeasurementsInternally we have three stereo amplifier modules.  So I decided to drive the unit in stereo using first and last channels.  This way we have some variation in modules and their placements.  Here are the results:Hypex spec is 0.002% which we are meeting here.  I could not figure out why the one channel had so much more mains noise (blue).  I tried every kind of grounding but it made no difference at all.  SINAD though is dominated by the second harmonic so that noise is not so material in that regard:So quite competent and better than any mass market AVR amplifier.Frequency response is pretty good for a class D amplifier:Signal to noise ratio is excellent even with that extra mains hum.  It nicely clears the noise floor of a 16-bit digital format:Crosstalk naturally was superb when measuring two different modules but also good in stereo mode in one module:Fascinating that a DIY amplifier can be so good whereas many premium audio products we test struggle here.Let's get into the meat of the review which is the power into 4 ohm load:The red pair of lines is using the two channels out of one amplifier module.  We see healthy amount of power to the tune of 224 watts each. Strangely when I tried two different modules (first and last as before), performance dropped some in both channels even though one channel is the same as before!  Maybe the two amps are fighting each other a bit for current.  Or there is some kind of beat frequency between them.  Not a real worry though as far as audibility but interesting nonetheless.Typical of these class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, there is no peak power:Here is our output with 8 ohm load:Testing for frequency dependency, we get good results as we expect from Hypex modules:ConclusionsI don't know the module price for the amps within this unit but getting 6 channels of amplification with such performance is a heck of a deal.  You are benefitting from a DIY person building these for you with no intention of making a living.    I will do a teardown soon and we can see if the internal build is good. I am happy to recommend the Buckeye 6 channel, NC252MP based amplifier.-----As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/\",\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of Accuphase E-270 Integrated Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from our friends at Gig Harbor Audio.  It is their demo unit so I have to return it on Tuesday.  So if you need something else to be measured, ask right away!  The E-270 was released in 2017 I think and retails for USD $5,000.  This is not cheap by our normal standards but in high-end audio, this is a pretty reasonable price.The industrial design of the unit seemingly has not changed from 1980s era with beautiful VU meters (with acceleration):At 44 pounds, the unit is quite heavy for its capabilities.  There is a massive transformer in the middle of the unit and the power amplifier modules with beefy heatsinks sit on either side.  During my testing, I could not even get the unit to become warm let alone hot!  It runs so comfortably that one thinks it is never going to stress out.The front has a slick finish that is lovely to touch.  Volume control is implemented through resistor ladders and hence has electronic control.  Accuphase says it has 6,500 steps which should be plenty for listening although was a bit difficult to dial in the exact value for measurements.There are slots in the back for optional DAC and phono stage (?) which mine did not have. All in all this is the type of construction, look and feel that would justify paying good bit of premium over a budget product. Given the likely reliability that comes from a high-end product from Japan, I say the stage is set for a good impression.Note: seeing how this is a demo unit to be sold, I did NOT attempt to stress the unit.  No long term warm up and certainly no stress test.  Given the overdesigned thermal design here though, I am not worried about the measurements holding under thermal stress.MeasurementsFor reasons that will become clear later, I decided to test the power amplifier section first.  Accuphase makes this dead easy with a front-panel button \"MAIN IN\" that decouples the power amp input from pre-amp output.  This allowed me to test the power amplifier separately and compare its performance to recently tested power amps.  So let\\'s start with our 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:I have added two more panels here: gain and dc output.  Have not verified the latter but should be correct.  As we see there is a 0.4 dB gain error and variation in distortion level.  The loads I use are not precision types (none are at these high power levels) so some of this may be instrumentation.  I did match levels (not shown) and distortion levels and differentials remained the same. At 92 to 95 dB SINAD, we are getting in territory of transparency for CD music.  The two distortion products are second and third harmonic at around -100 dB.Signal to Noise ratio is very good at 116 dB+:The E-270 is rated at 120 watts and it blows way past that to the tune of 155 watts prior to clipping (green pair):You can see the comparison to recently reviewed Onkyo M-282.  The E-270 outperforms it in every category from lower noise floor and distortion to more power prior to clipping.  The Onkyo of course is a budget product at $300. On not so good news, the Hypex based NC400 amplifier way outshines the Accuphase E-270.  It has far less noise, distortion and much more power. Whoever thinks class AB amplifiers are better than switching ones like NC400, this is the time to cry!  Pre-amplifierLet\\'s isolate the pre-amplifier and measure it at unity gain (same level output that is input):Wow, that is quite a bit better than the power amplifier with much lower noise floor and distortion.  Don\\'t get too excited though.  There are some really odd things going on here.  Let\\'s switch inputs to XLR:What the heck??? We lost 10 dB of performance.What is really, really strange is that if I measure RCA but leave the XLR cables connected, performance drops way down just the same!   You can see it easily in signal to noise ratio measurements:Accuphase hints at much lower performance of XLR input in the specs for the product:This aside, note as I have shown on the FFT chart above how we have lots and lots of power supply related spikes.  This is evident in an FFT of the spectrum (power amp only):Switching power supplies like used in Hypex NC400 amplifier shown in the inset in blue convert mains to DC and then convert it back to AC at hundreds much higher frequency (above audible frequencies).  As a result, you are free of mains related noise in good implementations.    There is no denying how clean the Hypex NC400 amplifier is in the audible band.  The Accuphase E-270 in contrast while cleaner than budget Onkyo M-282, has a ton of noise spikes.The problematic area for switching amplifiers is in the high frequencies so let\\'s look at that:The levels of noise and spurious tones is of course quite a bit lower than switching amplifiers.  We once again see that XLR input has worse performance (see zoomed inset).Let\\'s now re-measure the power versus distortion using the E-270\\'s pre-amp:We have a repeat of issues with XLR input again.  Notice the performance of RCA input with (red) and without XLR (blue) cable connected but not used.  And of course we leave fair amount of performance on the table with respect to the power amplifier alone. It seems that loading the pre-amp with the power amp reduces its performance substantially.  I traced this to pre-amp getting severely distorted when the power amp is under stress.  There is lack of isolation/independent power supply for the pre-amp.Story is the same with intermodulation distortion versus level:Interestingly enough the level sensitivity for XLR is the same as RCA.  I should be able to swing that to 4 volts for the same output with RCA at 2 volts.Frequency response falls in the category of very good news:I left the levels different for each input so that the graphs don\\'t fall on top of each other.  The power amplifier (blue) has the flattest response but by just a bit.  There is really no issue in the audible band to 20 kHz.ConclusionsOn fit and finish, the Accuphase E-270 integrated Amplifier delivers for a product in low thousands of dollars.  It has the nostalgic look of 1980s product which is popular now and certainly different than common mass market products.  Its power amplifier has respectable and conservative specifications.  Measurements show it to produce far more power than stated with massive thermal capacity which should spell long service life.Unfortunately I think there are some serious engineering issues in the pre-amplifier.  The XLR input not only generates much worse performance on its own, but also serves to pollute the performance of RCA input!  There is not sufficient power/isolation for the pre-amp causing its performance to sag when the unit is asked to produce a lot of power.  These are faults that I don\\'t tolerate in mass market products, let alone higher end ones.I would say if you want to get an Accuphase product, get a power amplifier.  The integrated unit as tested just doesn\\'t do that job so sadly, I cannot recommend it.EDIT: update the price to the correct one ($5,000 instead of $4,500).',\n",
       " 'This is a review and measurements of the Schiit Aegir stereo Power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member who has been patiently waiting since August for its review!  The Aegir is sold direct by Schiit and costs US $799 plus shipping.The Aegir is very heavy, substantial and serious looking piece of audio gear in black:What I don\\'t like is the extra sharp edges of the heatsinks on each side where you naturally want to grab it.  But I understand extruded aluminum comes this way and having the corners marchined would be expensive.Here is the back panel:At first I was super excited to see the XLR input but became puzzled why a stereo amp only has one of them.  Then I realized that it is only for driving the unit in bridged mode.  So for most of my testing I used RCA and then used XLR for bridged power testing.I can\\'t quite tell what type of amplifier this is from technical terms Schiit uses.  They seem to want to say this is mostly a class A amplifier but then it isn\\'t at higher power?  Anyway, the Aegir runs warm but not too hot so whatever trick they are using to lower power consumption of this unit versus pure class A is working.The Aegir is a new design which was introduced in 2018.  I see Audio Precision measurements for it which means it is part of the new design philosophy to take measurements and design verification seriously.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard feeding a 1 kHz tone into the amp, aiming for 5 watt output into 4 ohm:Starting on the left side, the gain of 20 dB is on the low side.  Then again the output power is so low (see later) that you don\\'t need a lot of gain to get to maximum power.SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) which is a positive dB version of THD+N mathematically (here anyway), puts the Aegir in respectable, above average ranking of all power amplifiers tested:We see good bit of power supply spikes which I verified to also exist in Schiit AP measurements.  Levels are below -100 dB so likely not audible due to our poor sensitivity in low frequencies.Frequency response is ruler flat in audible band:Signal to noise ratio is good, matching what we need for 16 bit audio playback:Multitone test tells us intermodulation between 32 tones fed to the amplifier:Once again, we see that we clear the 16 bit threshold of CD music.Most important test is power versus THD+N.  Let\\'s see that for 8 ohm:Schiit rates this amp at 20 watts into 4 ohm so we are close.  Likely they allow 1% distortion versus my standard of onset of clipping.What is puzzling is 4 ohm output:We are long ways away from 40 watts.  Then again, the clipping tilts to the right some so I suppose if you walked up that curve far enough, you get to 40 watts.  You would get good bit of distortion though so 40 watts is a marketing number.Note that one channel is more unhappy than the other.  I confirmed that exists just as well in Schiit measurements.  So likely power is fed is less efficiently to one amp than the other.  Or there are grounding, component mismatch, etc..To test bridged mode, I fed the Aegir vial XLR balanced connection and got this:I only get 23 watts of usable power which is hardly more than 19.5 watts I got in stereo mode.  The curve tilts to the right more now so marketing department went to town there to spec the \"80 watt number.\"  Measuring dynamic power which uses 1% number Schiit uses, we do get much more power:So with real music, you likely have more power than my continuous tone tests indicate.Let\\'s test how sensitive the Aegir is to input frequency:Sort of a classic output in that lower frequencies limit the amount of power available (clips earlier) but also have lower distortion.  I was asked to add multitone test to my amplifier measurements.  I usually use that for DACs since there, it is a lossless signal.  To use it for amplifiers, the signal has to be converted from PCM to analog which invokes the DAC in the AP.  That would put a limit on how good of a measurement I can make.  For amps like Aegir is not a limitation though so here it is:We see the general distortion floor is around -100 bits or 17 bits.  However, there are some earlier spikes due to power supply noise.  Again, our hearing is not very sensitive in that region so they can be ignored.ConclusionsThe Schiit Aegir is a competently designed amplifier with solid build quality and no design mistakes.  It shows the power of proper measurements and engineering verification to remove the element of surprise in third-party verification job we perform here.The main issue here is lack of power.  To someone like me, with very large spaces, rather inefficient speakers and desire for bass that you feel as much as you here, the Aegir is definitely not for me.  Nor do I buy into \"Class A\" having any benefit.  If it had, it would show up in measurements.  It does not.If have efficient speakers and/or don\\'t listen very loud, the Aegir is a solid offering from a western company.  I am going to put the Schiit Aegir on my recommended list for its solid engineering and design.  Fitness for application is up to you!  ',\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of a refurbished and upgraded NAD 2200 stereo amplifier. It was bought by a member, sent to QuirkAudio to be fully updated and then loaned to me. The work that Peter has done is exemplary.  The inside looks brand new! I have repaired hundreds of amplifiers but never seen one this clean!  So not only have the inside components been updated/replaced, but a lot of care has gone to cosmetically clean the unit. Peter sent me a long list of parts he has upgraded including reservoir capacitors and such. As a result, I don\\'t know how representative of measurements are of stock units although probably not too far off. Used 2200 go for about US $530 on ebay.The front panel is nice with an informative clipping indicator:As you see, you can put the amp in bridge mode (which I did not test) and select whether you want soft clipping on.  I left it off as you see in the picture.During use the protection circuit came on when appropriate and nicely reset as if nothing had happened.The NAD 2200 uses a dual voltage rail to keep power consumption and heat dissipation low when producing lower power and then upping the voltage for peak power.  This is a common technique but usually applied to low baseline power level.  Here, 100+ watts of power is provided using the low voltage power supply rail and it is only for power above that where the higher voltage is used.  Technique worked quite well as you see later and kept the amplifier cool and happy during my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Not bad!  Distortion is at or below -100 dB.  With noise, SINAD degrades to about 93 dB putting the 2200 well above average of nearly 100 amplifiers tested to date:Notice that the gain is quite high at 32 dB.  Common range is 25 to 29 dB with the latter being a \"THX\" standard.  The higher gain increases noise so despite that, performance is as good as seen.  High gain makes it a good fit for AVRs for example that produce distorted output well below nominal 2 volts.Frequency response has a sharp roll off which seems to indicate the output is not direct coupled (DC) as is common today:Or maybe it is on purpose, I don\\'t know.Crosstalk is very good:As is dynamic range:It is power measurements where the magic of this amplifier comes to life so let\\'s look at that with 4 ohm load first:We can see a kink in distortion when we hit 200 watts as the unit sails past that to produce whopping 337 watts per channel, both driven!  Per design characteristics, you can have much more during momentary peaks:Wow, we have one kilowatt of power coming out of this amp in short duration!Switching to 8 ohm we see similar results as 4 ohm:Sweeping the power test at 4 ohm with different frequencies shows a well-behaved amplifier:You do loose power in higher frequencies but that is fine since music spectrum has lower energy there anyway.Due to the long duration of this test, the protection circuit likely backed off the high voltage rail, producing lower output levels.EDIT: adding Lab Input MeasurementsLab Input MeasurementsI was surprised that the frequency response was not flat but was relieved to see later in the thread that this is due to insertion of low and high pass filters.  So here is the frequency response with Lab input that doesn\\'t have such a filter:Response now (in green) as it should be, ruler flat to below 10 Hz, and well extending past the 40 kHz limit of this measurement.I figured the filters may be adding some noise/distortion so re-ran the dashboard again:Distortion doesn\\'t change but if you look at the noise floor at 20 Hz, it is down by some 10 dB.  That improves SINAD a couple of dBs, making the amplifier stand out even more!Zoomed:And signal to noise ratio:ConclusionsNice to see innovation like this from equipment that is over 30 years old!  Shame on manufacturers that produce amplifiers for much less power, more distortion and higher prices these days.  No, you don\\'t get a fancy case here and sheet metal is strictly budget category.  But you are not going to sit on the amp.  The guts are where it matters and NAD 2200 delivers.NOTE: the output relay on stock 2200 gets corroded and fails over time.  There are videos and DIY threads on how to upgrade the relay there to fix the problem.  The unit tested here has that fix.  Other than that, there are not reports of many other reliability issues even though NAD products are often said to be less reliable than other brands.Overall, I am happy to recommend the NAD 2200.  I almost gave it the highest honors but given the upgraded nature of the test unit, and the fact that used amps may have issues, I avoided that.  But you could have easily pushed me to give it the golfing panther.',\n",
       " ' Devialet Expert 200 Amplifier, DAC, Phono premaplifier and wired streamer.  It seems to be a generation behind the current products offered by Devialet.  The Expert 200 cost US $9,650. The Devialet line of amplifiers made quite a buzz when originally announced given its unique, lifestyle packaging which has not changed yet:A combination of class A amplifier and class D current source is used to keep the size down, and efficiency up. Innovative for its time was inclusion of an SD card and online configurator to change the operation of the unit including re-purposing the back RCA connectors:The thin package creates real compromises here with the exclusion of balanced analog inputs or preamp outputs. Usability suffers quite a bit as well with the display being on top of the unit which simply is not visible from afar.  There is provision for wall-mounting but come on, no audiophile is going to do that and then dangle the cables from it.There is a very substantial remote but strangely has no display on it.  That would consume a lot more power, likely requiring a charger and such.Trying to troubleshoot a problem let me to going to their configurator site and downloading SD images some 10 times.  I have to tell you, it gets old taking the SD card out of the unit, plugging it into a PC, making a simple change, put it back in the unit, wait for a restart, to see the effect.  Granted, you only do this once in a while but during experimentation is quite tedious.  In this day and age, such configurator should be inside the unit and activated vi an app or with a browser.  The data on the SD card is very small anyway (some kind of simple text file).  So it is not like it is data intensive.Overall, I think looks are put way ahead of function on Davialet amplifiers. I had planned to do a much more extensive review of this unit but sadly, right after my first power sweep, it shut down and no longer powers back on.    The online brochure talks extensive about protection measures.  Clearly they are not enough as I suspect the microprocessor board has failed as opposed to the amplifier that has health monitoring.  I am hoping Devialet is responsive to this review and failure and make good on repairing this unit.  I have never had an amplifier fail in such a simple sweep that keeps the power max for just a few seconds.Anyway, I had accumulated enough data that I thought it is worthwhile to post it while waiting for a response from Devialet.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsThe Devialet amplifiers digitize their analog inputs so I thought I start with our dashboard of 5 watts driving using USB input:Distortion products are quite low at < -110 dB.  However, the noise floor is high in low frequencies causing our SINAD to suffer a lot, ending with a metric of 92 dB.  This is well above average compared to all the amplifiers we have measured but way short of state-of-the-art:Analog input creates a lot of harmonic distortion and with it, drags down SINAD a few notches still:I don\\'t understand how their ADC could distort so much in a product this expensive.  It can\\'t even clear 15 bits of distortion-free range.There are some lofty numbers like -130 dB noise floor is thrown around by Devialet.  I am not sure how that is computed.  Using analog Line-in for consistency with other amplifier measurements we get rather ordinary numbers:Crosstalk is good but again, not state of the art:At this point I went to measure a simple frequency response and got stomped  big time.  No matter what I did, the output would drop off randomly between 8 and 10 kHz.  As mentioned, I messed with the configurator, doing everything in my power to turn off filters, tone controls, etc., nothing helped.  So I dug in with just feeding the amp a 15 kHz tone and noticed that the output would jump up and down especially in one channel!  What the heck is going on????My frequency response testing is at 5 watts as that is what I use in my dashboard.  Turns out this amplifier cannot reproduce high frequencies reliably at 5 watts!  It has some kind of limiter that kicks in and pulls power back.  It also does that at low frequencies but at or past maximum power.  That I can sort of understand but not the high frequency hold back.  To see this in action, I ran my THD+N vs Level vs Power test:Focus on the red line first.  That is at 20 kHz.  Notice how it actually zigzags back and forth as input level is increased, but output level does not.  Or even goes backward!  This must be the \"good\" channel as it produced 10 watts.  The other channel was more finicky and as noted, would get upset at even 5 watts.Problem severity goes down with frequencies but still there at 10 kHz as indicated by the light blue line which zips back at around 180 watts or so.At lower frequencies, the amp simply refuses to increase power and not go into clipping.With this knowledge, I reduced output power to below 1 watt and ran my frequency response sweep:This is line-in so is digitized.  It produces about 48 kHz of bandwidth which is fine.  What is not so fine is that there is a phase shift between channels as frequencies go up:Some kind of filter is active here that is causing a phase shift between channels.  Even if there is some processing active (which there shouldn\\'t be as I disabled tone control and \"SAM\" speaker EQ), it should affect both channels equally as far as phase.Our story ends with my power measurement as noted:This is healthy amount of power at 269 watts with both channels driven into 4 ohms.ConclusionsWhile the Devialet is an elegant looking audio device, it clearly sacrifices usability and reliability/performance to get there.  There is something clearly wrong in the way it handles high frequencies.  No, this is not just me saying that.  It is also buried in the stereophile measurement of another one of their units: https://www.stereophile.com/content/devialet-d-premier-da-integrated-amplifier-measurementsA $10,000 amplifier can\\'t produce more than 20 watts at high frequencies without \"power supply collapsing?\"  Conclusions like this don\\'t help:No, this is not a testament to how good an amplifier can get.  No amplifier should power limit to just 20 watts (or lower in my case) in high frequencies.  We have issues with class D amps generating out of band noise that causes measurements to be low in this regard.  But they are producing full power.  Not so with Devialet. Then we have the phase shift.  Poor usability with \"sneaker net\" style of shuffling SD cards back and forth to make simple changes.And of course the total failure of the unit under a simple industry standard test of power sweep.I feel sad that an amplifier has failed under my watch.  I hope Devialet steps up and makes this right for the owner. ',\n",
       " \" Emotiva PA-1 monoblock class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and unfortunately discontinued.  When it was being sold, it cost $299.There is not much to look at here other than a blue indicator for when the unit is on:It is a balanced amplifier which is nice:There is an automatic trigger as you see. I tested it using always-on mode.I believe this is based on some ICEPower module from B&O (300AS1?).  In use the PA-1 didn't even get warm to touch.  Protection circuit was very good in that if you overload it, it clips but keeps going.  Other amps shut down requiring power cycling and such which an become annoying in my testing.Emotiva PA-1 MeasurementsOur standard dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm (1 kHz tone) shows very good performance:Distortion is at -100 dB which is quite nice making SINAD around 92 dB:This is well above our average of 78 across nearly 140 amplifiers tested to date.SNR is very good nearly matching my target of 96 dB at 5 watts:Multitone shows the same good performance:Frequency response unfortunately shows dependency on speaker impedance:Power into 4 ohm shows early rise of distortion:I cut off the power early in that graph.  If one allows it to go higher in distortion it produces a lot more power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Changing frequency shows what non-state-of-the-art class Ds produce:Namely a transfer function that changes with frequency and much higher distortion.Here is the spectrum of the switching frequency:ConclusionsIt is hard to get perfection at this price point but the Emotiva PA-1 tries hard.  It is a small package that runs cool yet produces well above average noise and distortion ratings.  It is a shame it is discontinued.I am going to put the Emotiva PA-1 on my recommended list.  Hopefully you can find some in second hand market or something.\",\n",
       " \" Yamaha R-N803 Receiver, amplifier, and streamer.  It was purchased by a member (b-stock?) and drop shipped to me.  The R-N803 costs US $750 from amazon including Prime shipping.The R-N803 has AV-style features such as Room EQ but with only two channels of amplification.  It has a retro look which is quite a bit nicer than an AVR though:Alas, beauty is only skin deep.  Those nice vertical controls are loose and have nowhere near the great feel of the 1970s gear with their solid mechanical selectors.  The back panel shows how the video features have been stripped away:As a package, it is much more appealing than the monster size of typical AVR.  So not a bad effort.Internally there are decent size heat sinks, one for each channel.  This is a huge step up from a shared flimsy heat sinks we see in modern AVRs with many channels.  This resulted in high robustness as in my testing, nothing caused the R-N803 to shut down or go into protection mode.  With AVRs it is common for them to do these things even though I still drive them with just two channels.Receiver Amplifier TestingI exclusively used the CD input for my testing.  There is a button for Pure Direct as there is on AVRs so let's engage that and see what we get:I set the volume control to +3 db to get the nominal 29 dB of gain.  Measurements were not that different at 0 dB.  I had to play fair bit to get rid of some ground loops (this is 2-pin, insulated device).  Once there, I was rewarded with pretty good SINAD which is a combined measure of distortion and noise:As you see, the ranking is way above average of just 77 dB SINAD.Switching off pure direct mode however, causes severe performance drop:Noise floor as moved massively up and distortion has increased.  Now we are back in the poor category of AVRs.  Sadly to use Room EQ you need to operate in this mode so you have a tough decision of whether you want to have low noise/distortion or room EQ.Dynamic range in pure mode is good:As is crosstalk:Frequency response is excellent in pure mode as well:Turning off pure (green) causes a sharp drop near 50 kHz which seems to indicate the input is digitized using 96 kHz sampling.  It is nice that this rate is a lot higher than many AVRs use.  Not so nice is the non-flat response even though I set all the controls to the middle.There is plenty of power into 4 ohm load at lower distortion and noise than a number of AVRs:Switching to 8 ohm load and measuring pure and non-pure modes, shows the poor performance of the latter:I had a slight issue with this test.  Just minor wiggling of the speaker terminals caused one channel to get distorted much earlier.  Not sure what is going on with that.Back to 4 ohm load, we see that we have plenty of headroom for momentary peaks in music:And here is our power test with different frequencies:At low frequencies approaching 20 Hz, distortion rises above 60 watts or so (orange).  Otherwise, this is a predictable performance with high frequencies being a bit more distorted than low.  And this is a good thing compared to nasty curves with get in some switching amplifiers.ConclusionsAs a pure, analog integrated amplifier, the Yamaha R-N803 does well.  It produces ample amount of power into 4 ohm with pretty low distortion and noise.  The visuals are also quite attractive.  Digital mode to use such things as Auto-EQ/filters is rather poor due to similar issues in many AVRs.  Sad that Yamaha did not go the extra mile and produce a better subsystem here.I personally don't like to use an AVR as a stereo setup due to their large size and not so pretty face plate.  So in that regard, I appreciate the Yamaha R-N803.Given the good, pure analog mode performance, and nice looks, I am going to put the Yamaha R-N803 on my recommended list. \",\n",
       " ' Audiophonics DA-S250NC class D amplifier (hypex NC252MP) and stereo DAC/Bluetooth. It was requested by a member and supplied by the company. It costs 582,50 € (tax excluded) (US$641).I really like the front panel display.  It has large font and super responsive rotary encoder that is a delight to use.  The power switch and input selections feel good as well.  Back panel shows the fact that only digital inputs are provided:In use the unit was robust in operation and recovered automatically from overloads.Audiophonics DA-S250NC DAC MeasurementsUsing pre-out, I measured the performance of the DAC.  Let\\'s start with our dashboard:I was surprised that I could not get more than 0.8 volt out of the pre-out. Like to see 2 volts.  Likely this is optimized for the gain setting of the integrated amplifier. Distortion is below -110 dB but because output level is rather low, noise drags that down to SINAD of 103 dB.  This is still competent performance:SNR is good enough for 16 bit content:Linearity is near perfect:Multitone is quite good until you get to upper registers:IMD vs level shows that impact of noise level:There were regular pulses at 1 KHz which is the USB sub-packet buffer size:I tried changing the filter settings but they seemingly made no difference:Might as well as this is a fine choice anyway.  Attenuation could be better, hurting THD+N vs frequency:Overall performance of the DAC is not bad.  Question is, is it good enough to not impact the amplifier performance?Audiophonics DA-S250NC Amplifier MeasurementsUsing the same USB input, I measured performance by setting the front panel volume control to -16.5 dB to get 5 watts and change output:This is very good performance, landing the amplifier well above average of all products ever tested:Zooming in:Noise performance is very good, almost meeting my 16 bit minimum SNR at 5 watts:Frequency response is nice in that it doesn\\'t show any load dependency:Crosstalk is better than average of all amps tested:Multitone test shows very good performance with almost no frequency dependency:I could barely get the amplifier to clip at max digital input/volume control:This tells me that we could have a bit more output voltage from the DAC to drive the amplifier.  This impacts 8 ohm more:Note that you want to operate in clipping region but a bit of power is left on the table as far as measurements are concerned.Since the amplifier barely distorts, I could not run my standard max and peak power using 1% THD metric.  I had to dial that down to 0.3% get max power:I was not able to run burst power due to same issue.  Note again that this is a \"good thing\" in that the amplifier just doesn\\'t distort enough to get more burst power.Let\\'s switch the load now from 8 to 2 ohm while also changing the phase angle as to represent capacitive and inductive loads:I am impressed that it handled 2 ohm at all but 60 degrees capacitive.  Output voltage dropped though so you don\\'t get to keep \"doubling down.\"  Likewise we lose output voltage at the extremes of ± 60 degrees at 4 and 8 ohm.Finally, as I suspected, you get double power on glitch with the amp and DAC powering on in sequence, resulting in some noise:ConclusionsThe DA-S250NC caught my eye from the moment I looked at the website.  The combination of a DAC and class D amplifier just makes sense to me for most people who only want a digital input. Many \"smart\" amplifiers exist in this domain but they are usually compromised.  Seeing a DAC married to hypex amplifier and combined with a nice front panel/remote seemed to be the ticket.  In testing, the DAC performance is just good but seems to be mating well enough to the amplifier.  Any more performance and it would kind be wasted there.  So I can\\'t complain much.  A version of this with higher performance DAC and amplifier would be just dandy!  Overall, I like and recommend the Audiophonics DA-S250NC.',\n",
       " ' NAD C 320BEE power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan.  The C 320BEE is a vintage product, dating back to 2003 I think.  The BEE designation is apparently a reference to Bjorn Erik Edvardsen who was one of their designers.  Can\\'t tell if he designed this version or this is based on work he did years earlier.  Either way, I am told it is a \"classic.\"  I don\\'t keep up with such things but I am sure some of you will set me straight if that is, or isn\\'t so.  From what I can tell the original cost was US $399.  So quite a budget piece for a mid-tier brand like NAD.The C 320BEE is typical of NAD design language which is maintained to this day:There are set of tone controls and balance which I appreciate in this day and age when it is removed from most gear.I did not seek out the manual and remain unsure how this thing powers on.  You hit the power button but nothing happens until you press one of the input buttons???Here is the back panel:It is an old school layout with non-removable power cord, jumper set for pre to power map.  And a set of RCA jacks lined up.The unit appears to run cool but there are large holes on the bottom where the amplifier heatsink is and if you touch that heatsink, it gets quite hot.In testing, without undue stress, the unit went into protection and would not reset until I cooled it off with a fan and left it off for a few minutes.  Most amps survive my testing without going into protection mode since I only push them to max power for seconds.Also, in the process of changing my setup for 4 to 8 ohm, the unit went into oscillation, producing 107 watts on its own with no signal.  So there is some instability in the design.  This happened when I changed my load impedance to 8 ohm so perhaps you won\\'t see it if you don\\'t mess with speaker output while the unit is on.To be on the safe side, for the last few tests I put a fan on top to keep it cool and that got it to run very reliably. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:The highest distortion product is at -100 dB.  Since out SINAD (signal to noise and distortion), is only 90 dB, it means there is 10 dB of noise that is degrading that.  All else being equal, noise is less of an audible problem than distortion so that is good.  Take at its value, the C 320BEE clocks much better than many other amplifiers we have measured in this regard:Drilling into the 1 kHz tone spectrum we see the nice clean output of classic AB amplifier:Those of you who hate class-D spectra in ultrasonics, can rejoice now.  Signal to noise ratio is good but is power dependent:I think the spec is a few dBs better than this but I am sure you can mess with levels and volume control position to get there.  Either way, this is plenty clean for CD/16-bit playback.Crosstalk is unremarkable compared to state-of-the-art:Fortunately, this should not be an audible issue as there is plenty of separation between channels here.  Frequency response is broad and quite flat in audible band:Even at 100 kHz, the response is only down 1 dB.  So your high-resolution music can sing without the amplifier truncating their bandwidth.Let\\'s look at intermodulation distortion (two tones at 60 and 7 kHz) versus power output:This is a well-behaved amplifier until it gets to its limit and then clips hard as amplifiers tend to do.  Of note, there is a \"soft clip\" light but I did not see it come on in any of my tests.We can run the same test but with two high frequency tones of 19 and 20 kHz:Forgetting about the ultrasonic ones around 38 kHz, the distortion sidebands remain at -100 dB which is very nice.  You can play your 16 bit content without worrying about any distortion above its noise floor.Most important test is power versus distortion.  Let\\'s start with 4 ohm load:This is very modest level of power but no strangeness in its response.  We can run the test again but compare to modern \"streaming\" amplifiers of today:We have very clean power compared to them but less power as compared to either SONOS or Amazon Link Amp.  The NAD does outperform the NuForce STA-200 though in every respect.  Switching to 8 ohm gets us this:I am puzzled that power output remains identical in both cases.  Something must be controlling that.The graph of distortion versus frequency at power levels is quite messy as it typically is:Putting aside the light pink which is at or near clipping, the amp if well behaved with only a modest rise in distortion as power levels increase.To keep things exciting , I added a new measurement to this test.  It is the \"dynamic\" power according to CEA-2006/490A designed to keep car audio amplifier companies honest with peak power:These are burst power measurements.  Let me know if you like them and I will run them in future reviews.  I think there is some merit to measuring this way as music is not continuous sine wave.ConclusionsNice to go back in time and test amplifiers which were simple to understand and simple to measure.  The NAD C 320BEE seems to have been competently designed for modest power delivery at a budget price.  In that regard, it completely succeeds in its mission.Personally, I think 67 watts is not enough for home listening.  Today\\'s speakers have become smaller in size and shrunk in efficiency, needing fair bit of power to get them to produce proper dynamics.  If you disagree otherwise, or have sensitive speakers, the NAD C 320BEE seems to be a good unit to buy.  It certainly does away with any anxiety you may have with using class-D amplification.',\n",
       " ' Yamaha WXA-50, multi-function DAC, pre-amp, power amp, streaming and multi-room unit.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Even though it came out a few years ago (2016?), it is widely available.  Amazon shows it costs US $478.Success of SONOS as a multi-room audio solution has been the envy of many traditional audio companies.  Many have tried to chase them with Yamaha being one of the earlier ones.The WXA-50 is a surprisingly heavy unit although looks somewhat unremarkable:The case is metal as best as I can tell which is good as the unit generates good bit of heat.  Strangely the heat is concentrated on the left side yet the vents are on the right!  There is an IR hole on the left which confused me to no end, constantly wanting to push it to turn on the unit.  I am not a fan of a single light indicating input and overload condition of the amplifier.  Worst part of the interface is the volume control which has no marking and no display.  Unless you use the app, you have no idea what volume you have set this to.  This made my testing maddeningly hard.I downloaded the App and here, I was pleasantly surprised by the performance and reliability of it.  With no configuration, the WXA-50 was recognized and manipulating its controls were instantaneous and reliable.  I only used the App to reset the EQ, etc. so for its full functionality, you should seek out other reviews.The back panel has extensive set of inputs and outputs although lacks USB:I was pleased to see both analog input and outputs.Yamaha heavily courted the Custom Install (CI) industry to use this instead of SONOS and it shows from inclusion of trigger input and output for control.  Inclusion of Toslink input goes along these lines to fetch audio from a TV being fed by HDMI.DAC Audio MeasurementsI briefly measured DAC performance.  I read however that there are two DAC chips inside this unit (an ESS and Bur-brown/TI) and that the fixed output is driven by the latter.  So this may not be representative of what happens when you stream music into this device:This is decent performance although it degraded fair bit if I turned up the volume on the amplifier to max.  That increased the higher order harmonics even though the output level of the DAC did not change.  We have seen this before and likely is the power supply sagging causing DAC performance to suffer.  SInce you don\\'t listen at max volume level, I did not derate the WXA-50 performance when including it in the performance chart:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsSince we have analog inputs, I started my testing using that and got this for our usual dashboard at roughly 5 watts:I played around with combination of input levels and volume control and performance was pretty consistent.  SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) is actually quite respectable for an amplifier:I tested the same, this time using Roon to stream the 1 kHz tone to it using Airplay:We lose just a couple of dBs although distortion levels are a bit lower.From here on, I tested the unit using its analog input unless specified.Frequency response shows decent bandwidth and flat response in audible band:No strange and limiting digitization of input is visible which is good.Signal to noise ratio is good enough for 16 bit audio:Let\\'s get into all important measurement: power into 4 ohm versus distortion:We are close to meeting the spec (I measure at much lower distortion than they do).  We have cleaner power than either Sonos or Amazon amps although the SONOS has much more power.Here is the performance at 8 ohm:I don\\'t have as much data for 8 ohm but what is there, shows competent performance but with just 55 watts on tap.Intermodulation distortion versus power level tells a similar story:THD+N versus frequency and power shows very predictable performance with no corner cases exposed:Only 20 Hz tones gives it a bit of trouble with rising distortion above 10 watts but that is slight.The unit also shut down at 20 kHz at max clipping level. I reduced the volume level a few notches and that went away even though I was still pushing the unit into hard clipping.Spectrum of 1 kHz tone with no AES filter shows the usual noise in high frequencies we get from class-D amps:While this looks ugly, the spikes near audio band are way down at -75 dB which is very good.  I have tested amps where these levels are much, much higher.The two channels have different switching frequencies.  Not sure if this is on purpose or variation in the clock source of their modulators.  The two beat against each other likely creating the intermodulation spikes that we see throughout the range.ConclusionsUnlike the bag of parts performance I often see in these modern streaming products, the Yamaha WXA-50 seems to have benefited from some attention to raw performance of each subsystem.  There are no funny results, strange pipelines that go in and out of digital domain, etc.  The performance graphs are all smooth with no sudden jaggies or other anomalies.  This makes it easier to use the unit, not having to work around its weakness (I am talking to you SONOS).We also have decent amount of power, approaching 100 watts into 4 ohm which should be plenty.  If you add the subwoofer to it, you will be golden even at high SPLs.The app likewise, gives a feeling of polish that I often find lacking in competing products.In summary, I did not raise an eyebrow when measuring the Yamaha WXA-50.  It won\\'t provide competition to state-of-the-art separate products but it also doesn\\'t embarrass.  As such, I am going to put the WXA-50 on my recommended list.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.I was reading that the standard diet for panthers is large animals such as deer, antelope, etc.  I have not fed anything like that to my panthers and they are starting to mumble \"animal abuse\" under the lips.

       " ' PS Audio Stellar S300 Stereo Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The S300 costs US $1,499 from the company.Fitting the design language of the rest of the PS Audio and using similar enclosure, the S300 is quite hefty considering that it uses class-D amplification:There is just a power switch and light that indicates whether the unit is on, or has shut down due to protection circuit kicking in.The back panel shows very high quality and beefy connectors:As you see, there are redundant pairs of speaker sockets which I assume is an invitation to use bi-wiring.  Or feed the subwoofer using them as Paul McGowan advocates although a warning tells you to be careful as these are floating signals, not ground referenced.XLR inputs are nicely provided which I used for all of my testing.The internal amplification is provided by ICEpower 300AS1 modules.  These are integrated power supply and single channel amplifier modules.   PS Audio uses its own input buffer on these which they call \"Analog Cell.\"  This got the owner worried that it would measure poorly as did the PS Audio Stellar Gain Cell Preamplifier and DAC.  I must say it got me worried reading the description of it too:Seeing how the class-d module uses ample feedback to linearize its response, it is puzzling that he thinks the input stage should be without one.  Either feedback is good ro bad.  Can\\'t have it both ways.Anyway, back to the operation of the unit, it ran cool and never got upset in my testing.  Overall, my subjective impression of the unit is positive.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs always, we start with 5 watt output into 4 ohm and see where we stand:Ah, that is respectable!  FFT spectrum just shows two distortion products with the second one at or below -100 dB.  There is however noise though which pushes the combination of those distortions and noise to -88 dB resulting in SINAD of same amount, only positive.  This puts the S300 amplifier above our median for all power amplifiers tested so far:Our frequency response is a bit variable at the high end:I looked up the 300AS1 response as shown in the inset and is consistent with that.  While most of us won\\'t hear that rise in response, it does show load dependency which means each speaker will interact with it differently.All my tests use an AES-17 filter which has a flat response to 40 kHz and beyond.  But for the purposes of finding the actual high-bandwidth spectrum of the unit, I take it out for this test of 1 kHz tone at 5 watt:Switching frequency is around 450 kHz which is fine.  Typical of many of these class-d modules, the level is high at just -15 dB below signal. @DonH56 recently asked me if the level of switching noise tracks the signal itself so I decided to test for that by upping the power by a good bit to 180 watts and see what happens:As you see in blue, there is good news and bad news.  Good news is that the level doesn\\'t scale with output power much.  Bad news is that its spectrum becomes quite wide so total energy may have increased that much.  Certainly scary to the eye but likely not to the ear.  Anyway, back to our regular programming, here is our signal to noise ratio:Not that good at 5 watt as we could have predicted from the SINAD in the dashboard.  At full power the situation improves but still not very competitive with top of the class switching amplifiers which can clock as high as 125 dB.  So be careful with sensitive speakers.Most important graph for amplifiers is power versus distortion+noise.  Here it is into 4 ohm:We have tons of good power to the tune of 256 watts.  Distortion starts to rise early though at just 10 watts.Here is the response into 8 ohm:Perhaps more revealing is what happens if we perform the same sweep but at different frequencies starting at 20 kHz and working our way down to 20 Hz.  An ideal amplifier would have all the graphs landing on top of each other.  But this is what we get here:At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the graphs indeed nicely land on top of each other (bottom group).  But at 5 kHz and higher, we get very odd responses indicating multiple non-linearities taking turn to dominate.  I thought this was an issue with PS Audio implementation but the same response is shown by ICEPower in their data sheet.Peak power shows disappointing level of headroom available for short durations as would be typical in music:The switching power supplies in class-d amplifiers are tightly regulated which means the power you get in steady-state, is what you get in peak.  Standard class AB amplifiers tend to have variable supply rails which if you don\\'t tax much, will maintain higher voltage and produce more power in short bursts.  For this reason, you may want to get a more powerful class D amplifier to replace a class AB amp.ConclusionsIt is a sigh of relief that PS Audio had not managed to reduce the performance of the ICEPower modules.  Response and sonic abilities are completely determined by those modules unlike what PS Audio marketing says.  The ICEPower module used here has a distinctly lower performance than Hypex modules we have tested in the past. So you are not going to get state-of-the-art performance.  For that, you need to go to amplifiers higher in the SINAD graph.Still, this is a competent, well-built and well-supported amplifier based on proven amplification modules within.  Build quality is much higher than DIY or garage shop amplifiers using Hypex modules.  $1,500 is not a ton of money given these attributes.  For these reasons and good looks of the unit, I am going to put the PS Audio Stellar S300 amplifier on my recommended list.',\n",
       " \" NAD 7050 integrated DAC, amplifier and streaming playback.  It is on kind loan from a member.  It appears the product was announced in 2014 and since discontinued as I can't find it on sale anywhere.  The cost was USD $999 from what I can gather.The unit can be used both horizontally and vertically.  A rotational sensor changes the display orientation conveniently.  Here is its upright position which I consider better for sound since the electrons can naturally free fall into the speaker terminals:The outside has what appears to be some sort of rubber glued to it.  It is soft to touch but picks up dirt very easily and is impossible to clean due to sticky nature of it.The large knobs imply great feel which they don't have.  They wobble as you rotate them.  The larger knob is the volume control which had an odd delay in updating the display as you rotated it.  Overall, a good effort has been made to create an unusual design but didn't quite get there in feel and functionality.The back panel shows off the inputs and speaker output:For my testing, I focused on USB input as I suspect that is the most common interface for consumers.  Alas, the USB interface is class one so only goes up to 96 kHz.  To get the advertised 192 kHz you need to use the other inputs.  I downloaded the NAD drivers which nicely gave me ASIO interface for testing.There is an app to control it and I downloaded it from Android play store.  It is a simple remote control but allowed me to change the audio-out to be full range so I could use it for DAC testing.  Otherwise it is filtered for subwoofer out.  Despite its simplicity the app crashed on me once.There is no analog input so I had do all of my testing with USB digital interface.As expected from a brand name company, the NAD 7050 comes with full set of safety and emissions regulatory certifications.The amplification in NAD 7050 apparently is a scaled down version of what is in NAD M2.  Here is what NAD says about it:My read is that it is a power DAC similar to Lyngdorf TDAI-3400 I reviewed recently.  Measurements will confirm if so.DAC MeasurementsAs usual, where possible I try to isolate the performance of the subsystems, in this case the DAC.  Here is our dashboard view using USB input/Line Out.  I hope you are sitting down if you owan the 7050 and use it as a DAC:What the heck is going on here?  Even at 0 dB the unit doesn't get to 2 volts yet it severely clips resulting all of those harmonic distortions.  Dialing down to -2 dBFS improved performance but just to 83 dB. By then the output voltage was even lower, making it not so useful as a DAC anyway.  My thinking is that this is a split off output from the power amplifier as opposed to a traditional DAC output.   I guess for the assumed subwoofer duty it may be OK.Naturally, with the SINAD as measured falls at the bottom of the graph of DACs tested:After the first bad impression, the 7050 almost nails the rest of the measurements such as linearity:And jitter:Since USB doesn't support 192 kHz, I had to run a different multi-tone test at 44.1 kHz:Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual, the dashboard view is at 5 watts of power into 4 ohm:As power amplifier measurements go, this is not too bad actually and almost matches the vaguely stated 90 dB spec by NAD.Power versus distortion+noise is also pretty decent:The downward part of the curve is always dominate by noise as the output level is low.  Here, that part of the curve is flatter than I am used to seeing which is good as far as level of noise.  Likewise, distortion is kept under complete control until onset of sudden and massive clipping at 54 watts.  This too is good (sans the clipping).  Stated rating is 50 watts at 4 ohm and we beating that a bit which is nice.  Then again, 50 watts is not that much power in grand scheme of things.THD+N versus frequency using my default 45 kHz bandwidth shows pretty awful results (in red):Suspecting ultrasonic noise at play, I re-ran the test with 22.4 kHz (as with the dashboard) in blue which shows that effect quite conclusively.  One channel is worse than the other though which is strange.  Note that the drop above a few Khz is due to bandwidth of the test being too low to capture all the harmonics (and hence the reason I like to use 45 kHz bandwidth normally).Broadband FFT shows of 1 kHz tone shows us what is going on:This is without my Audio Precision high-frequency filter (AUX-0040).  All the other tests used that filter.On the extreme left we see our 1 kHz tone as a spike rising to 0 dB or so.  We have a single and large spike at 850 kHz.  That seems to indicate to me that 850 kHz may be the switching frequency.  Given its high frequency, the power DAC is running likely with as a single bit converter which would create a lot of quantization noise.  Noise shaping is used to push that above 30 kHz or so with the peak at about 80 kHz.  This is the drawback of power DACs as we have seen in the Lyngdorf and SONOS Amp versus class D amplification which doesn't need noise shaping.  You can see the effect of high frequency noise in the thickened sine wave of the same signal in the inset.ConclusionsUsually, by the time I get to the end of testing, I have a good idea of if I like or don't like a device.  Here, I am not quite sure.  Let's agree that no one should be using the NAD 7050 as a DAC with external amplification as NAD suggests in the manual.  You will be listening to a heap of distortion products with anemic output to boot.The amplifier seems to have some good tricks under its sleeves with lower than normal noise and very controlled distortion until a very hard limit.  My issue there is the 50 watt rating for a $1000 device.  That is just not enough power for a product in this category.Seeing how the NAD 7050 is discontinued, maybe it doesn't need my recommendation or lack thereof anyway.  So I will leave it at that.  \",\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $89.99 with stock 32 volt supply.  Price goes up to $109.99 with the 48 volt supply.  There is a $10 discount coupon right now.Despite its budget price, the V3 manages to look elegant with the hole pattern on top and large and smooth feeling Volume/On/Off control. Power supply is external and as noted, you get a choice:As you will see later, you really want the 48 volt version:Yes, it is a larger supply but you are going to hide it behind your desk anyway so might as well live the good life with the increased power there.  The amplifier is based on TI TPA3255 class D amplifier IC.  There are replaceable op-amps for those of you who have nothing better to do than mess with the design.When I took the amplifier out of the package, I noticed something rattling in there.  Fearing the worst, I took the unit apart. Turns out one of the two large power supply caps had lost its adhesion to the PCB. The putty used is to keep the cap glued to the PCB was too flexible and had broken loose. No harm though as the cap is laying on its side and can\\'t go anywhere. The sound I was hearing was it moving just a hair up and down and hitting the top of the case.  Suggest company use a different material to fix this.I will post the pictures of the insides later.  For now, a large aluminum couples the amplifier IC to the case. There is no thermal grease but the amp ran cool enough that I don\\'t think you need to worry about it. But if you are, this you can remedy yourself.  Despite me pushing the amp to max power repeatedly, it just got warm to touch.  The protection circuit was the best kind with high tolerance of clipping and audio-restart.Fosi Audio V3 Amplifier MeasurementsI performed the low power tests using the 32 volt supply.  The rest is done with both.  So let\\'s start with our usual dashboard:Distortion is nicely kept to -100 dB so we are noise limited causing SINAD to land around 88 dB.  This is well above average for all amplifiers tested:Notice how many amplifiers it beats to the right of it!Noise performance is also quite good for the class, almost clearing the hurdle for 16 bit content at just 5 watts:Frequency response shows load dependency which all class D amplifiers in this price range show:In English, this means that depending on which speaker you use, the sound may be a bit bright or a bit dull if your hearing extends to 20 kHz.  You can counter with EQ (which you better have for good sound in your room).Multitone and 19+20 kHz show good performance for the class:Edit: forgot to post crosstalk measurement:Let\\'s see how much power we can get out of this little box into 4 ohm:You normally wouldn\\'t expect to get more power with a 48 volt supply compared to 32 volt when their current ratings are the same.  But as I noted in the picture at the start, the larger power supply is conservatively rated and is able to pump out more current for peaks.  We can see this in our short-term power measurements:With 8 ohm volt, we are more in need of voltage so naturally we get tons more there as well with the 48 volt supply:Transfer function is quite good for class D and I was especially impressed with its ability to pump out same power at high frequencies as many amplifiers go into protection there:There is some pop noise when turning on and off but it is very mild:The amplifier is stable on power up:Some of you have been aiming at creating more work for me by asking for for efficiency tests. I developed a test that is semi-automatic and provides reasonable accuracy (within 5%):Note that part of the heat is dissipated in the power supply and part in the amp.  The X axis is power per channel, not total (amp is driven in stereo).Edit: here are the teardown pictures:ConclusionsState of the art DACs run on highly performant silicon that when well implemented, produces the best performance we have seen.  We are seeing similar development with these class D IC amplifiers.  Noise and distortion is quite low and beats many amplifiers in the market.  They bring two drawbacks: external power supplies and load dependencies.  If the latter is resolved, these amplifiers would obsolete large segment of the audio market!The Fosi Audio V3 is well implemented and brings nice looks and design at a bargain price.  Company is also quite receptive to customer input and is a delight to work with behind the scenes.  I don\\'t know what else we could ask for!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier.EDIT: a few pages in the thread claim was made that the input buffer opamp must be fake as they don\\'t look like the official TI chip packaging.  Company chimed in a couple of days later saying they bought the ICs directly from TI.  And showed the purchase order proving the same.  It seems the \"internet got this wrong\" as far as what constitutes a fake as TI is using two different factories with different packaging.',\n",
       " ' Denon PMA-50 Audio (speaker) amplifier with included DAC and Bluetooth.  It is on kind loan from a member. It seems to be discontinued but when available, it cost US $599.  I see it on ebay and such from $370 to $450.The enclosure is more stout and nicer looking/feeling than a lot of products in this category:The volume control is large and nice feeling.  It works a bit odd though in that when you first turn it, it switches the display to volume level but doesn\\'t do anything with respect to changing the level.  You need to keep turning it to have it take effect.There is a headphone amp which I did not test yet.  May do that later.Back panel shows a nice suite of digital and analog inputs but no line out for the DAC:I performed all of my testing with USB and a bit with analog Aux input.Included mains power supply gets rid of the tangle of wires that comes with external supplies.Internally this is a \"DDFA\" design which means it accepts digital input and converts it to PWM for amplification. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI started my initial test with USB input to the amplifier and got this:While not state-of-the-art, performance is above average for amplifiers we have tested with respect to distortion:Using analog input degrades performance fair bit:We lose about 5 dB, mostly in elevated noise level.  Note the channel mismatch when you use analog input as opposed to digital.Frequency response using USB input and high sample rate of 192 kHz, shows the noise shaping/filtering of the digital amplifier:Young people with good hearing may hear some elevated sharpness.  Total bandwidth though is better than some other amps we have tested which truncate at 22 kHz and such.Looking at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone, we see a very well behaved amplifier despite being class-D:Ultrasonic noise is limited to -60 dB.  Some other products have peaks as high as -20 dB here.  There is a single spike at 840 kHz or so, which is likely the switching frequency.Note that I did not have to use my AES filter as I usually do with class D amp.  The analyzer was not confused by the ultrasonic noise as present.Using USB input we get very clean signal until the amp stops producing power:54 watts of power slightly beats the 50 watt specification into 4 ohm.  Alas, this is not much power, relegating the unit to office, small room use.As expected, power drops with 8 ohm load:I suggest getting a 4 ohm speaker to extract the max power out of the unit.Using analog input, we can compare the power at 4 ohm to other amps tested.  Here again, the gain was strange as turning it up to 0 dB, caused elevated noise and very early clipping.  So I dialed volume down and drove the unit to 2 volt input to get this:As we see, its modern competitors all have tons more power.The digital input though does better as we see in this IMD comparison:If the PMA-50 had more power, it would be a real contender here.Signal to noise ratio using USB input at nearly 5 watts and max power yielded this:We barely miss the spec at max power.  Even at 5 watt though, we are reasonably close to noise floor of CD/16-bit audio.  So not bad.ConclusionsThe Denon PMA-50 seems to be competently designed.  It has none of the performance quirks of cheap class-D amps.  It has a solid cabinet and controls to go with that engineering.The big knock against it is modest amount of power and high price relative to competition.  And in this day and age, lack of streaming support.I personally put huge value on power in amplifiers so can\\'t recommend the PMA-50 on that front.  But you have the data and can judge for yourself with your priorities.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.The weather has warmed up and we are having a glorious, dry spring which is unusual for us.  The panthers have noticed the same and have been pestering me for a picnic lunch.  They may seem small in pictures but they have voracious appetite so I need money for food and drinks for them.

       " \" Marantz PM-90 Vintage stereo integrated amplifier.  It was purchased by a member from japan and drop shipped to me for testing.  It came out in 1991 with a price of 160,000 Yen (about $1,500 in today's exchange rate).  I looked online and I can only find one for US $950 but it is more beat up than this unit.I must say, this is one nice looking amplifier with a look that would fit in even today:The feel of the controls is excellent other than volume control which I found a bit loose.  A flip down door gives you additional control including switching between Class AB and Class A mode of operation!  Sadly it requires the unit to be powered down to change so no opportunity for instant switching and comparison.I was pleasantly surprised to see modern, beefy speaker terminals as well:Even more interesting is the inclusion of XLR balanced inputs for CD.This amplifier is back breakingly heavy due to use of two massive transformers.  It is at the limit of what I could lift and carry up two flight of stairs for testing.  Sitting here, my back aches just thinking about the reverse trip to pack the darn thing!  Speaking of packing, it was immaculately double boxed by Hifi-Do with zero impact to it despite the long journey.  Apparently it even came with one year warranty although you have to ship it back to Japan for that.Speaking of Japan, the unit is made for that market and hence 100 volt rating as opposed to 120 volts we have here in US.  If it were mine, I would go ahead and use it at 120 but being that of someone else's and hard to replace, I powered it by both my Lab AC generator and a Variac set to 100 volts.  This may have caused some measurement issues as I noted below.Marantz PM-90 Amplifier MeasurementsThere is a lot here to test due to dual mode of operation and dual type of input.  Let's start with Class A operation with RCA and then XLR:Unfortunately our measurements are polluted by high mains noise and harmonics.  I tried every which way but could not reduce that impact much.  Whether this is due design of the amplifier or longer AC mains connection due to use of lab AC gen or Variac, I can't tell.  As is SINAD doesn't appear to be better than modern AVRs with Marantz on their front plate:However, if we look at the FFT, we see only two harmonics and then it disappears into noise.  Here is the performance of Marantz SR7015 as a reference:Noise from power supply is lower there which aids it in getting similar SINAD.Switching to Class AB mode has no penalty:If anything distortion harmonics go a bit lower although that was not reliable.To see if there is a difference at all between Class AB and Class A, I turned on the residual mode of Audio Precision in the scope display.  This shows us the difference between input and output waveforms.  If there is zero crossing error due to class AB operation, we should see more difference around that part of the waveform but we don't:What is there is mostly power supply noise.  I changed frequencies, power level down to 1 watt and still saw nothing that would correlate with zero crossing distortion which class A is supposed to solve.  Feedback and class AB operation seem to have cured that ailment leaving little room for Class A to do better.Here is the comparison between Class AB and Class A again with respect to signal to noise ratio:Class AB pulls ahead in full power mode because it can create more power.  At baseline 5 watts they are similar likely limited by power supply noise.Crosstalk showed a tiny improvement in favor of class A but it is not material:Bandwidth is good but not exceptional:Notice how amplifier gain changes as you switch modes so for any listening tests, you may have to compensate for that.Class AB of course has tons more power:Overall shape of the graph is average.  Wanting to see the impact of the pre-amp vs power amp, I separated the two and fed the unit with my analyzer direct using RCA:As expected, my analyzer is cleaner but impact is on distortion, not noise which is a bit surprising.  As is one channel being worse than the other.   SINAD reaches almost 100 dB now near full power, good channel, which is very nice.There is a lot of headroom when using class AB vs Class A:Testing amplifier linearity vs frequency we get:Class A power limits more at 20 Hz than Class AB.  Both show very predictable and smooth responses which is great.Multitone tests shows slightly lower distortion at higher frequencies in favor of Class A:Effectiveness of feedback lowers at higher frequencies and likely this is the reason class A does better there.Marantz PM-90 Phono Input MeasurementsIt was hard to figure out a fair way to measure the performance of its phono stage to compare to stand-alone devices.  At first I used tape output but that didn't produce great response.  Best was from pre-amp tap to power amp:Sadly the mains noise is there and dwarfs SINAD.  There is no sign of harmonic distortion so that is very good.  Same situation exists for MC mode:RIAA equalization is probably the best I have measured:That story continues into headroom measurements:You get almost 12 volts of output before it starts to clip!  So pops and clicks should be much less noticeable.ConclusionsThe PM-90 does NOT show its age.  It produces above average performance compared to today's amplifiers.  It does so while running very cool and comfortable.  Not once did it get warm to touch or go into protection.  Push it hard and it just pulls back on the output but keeps going.  Clearly this is a very robust implementation.  Can it compete with state of the art amplification today in the form of Benchmark THX and Hypex/Purifi Class D amps?  No.  There is real innovation there to push down distortion and noise.  But we also have a lot of terrible amplifiers today which the PM-90 easily outperforms and does it with so much style.There is nothing to apologize for and a lot to praise for Marantz PM-90.  I hope the company goes back to these roots rather than horrible looks and performance of much of their AV line.On class A mode, I see no reason to recommend it and many reasons to avoid it.  If you run out of power there, you will certainly create audible distortion.  Whereas any benefit it might have is literally lost in the noise.I am happy to recommend the Marantz PM-90.\",\n",
       " \" XTZ A2-300 class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $500 from the company direct (which is located in Europe).  It is based on B&O ICE 300ASC or its newer name, 300A1.While you won't mistake the enclosure for A2-300 as a high-end, custom design, it has enough extra touches to set it above typical DIY type cases:There are some nice looking vents on the side.   Note however that all the heat is centralized in the center bottom panel as is typical of class D amp modules.  In use though, the bottom barely got warm although I could smell heat generation through side vents.I was disappointed to not see balanced inputs:The gain potentiometer will make the unit flexible but they are typically not good for reliability.  Since these controls don't get used often, then tend to go bad.  If you buy this unit, be sure to turn the control left and right once a few months.Binding posts are substantial which I liked.XTZ A2-300 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm:As noted, I adjusted the gain control to give me roughly 29 dB which is the standard value I use for my testing (and matches the THX recommendations).  Distortion is fairly low at -98 dB or so but there is enough noise to cost you 10 dB and a bit more in the other channel.  This makes SINAD still above average:As noted, noise is somewhat an issue and we can see that in signal to noise ratio:Notice how one channel is 3.5 dB worse than the other.I was a bit disappointed to see frequency response being impacted by my simple resistive load, showing peaking around 20 kHz:More complex speaker loads may make this worse (or better).  Crosstalk is OK:Here is our power level versus distortion+noise at 4 ohm:We see the same noise differential here and some distortion differential as well (although the latter is somewhat common).  Power is way short of 300 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% which is what the spec calls for, we are still shy of that:So definitely not conservatively rated.8 ohm load naturally produces a lot less power:Typical of ICE modules, they don't behave evenly across the frequency range:That is quite a variation in distortion and noise relative to power.  In some sense then our previous tests using 1 kHz are not as representative of the total performance.ConclusionsI started the review liking the enclosure.  But then got a bit more jaded with unbalanced only inputs, and higher than expected noise level, high frequency dependency on both frequency response and distortion+noise. Then again, performance is still above average compared to many amplifiers I have tested.  This produced a quandary for me.  I could recommend it and justify it.   At the end, I decided to not recommend it but without strong feelings one way or the other.  You have the data to decide for yourself.\",\n",
       " ' NAD C268 power amplifier with balanced inputs.  It is kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $900 at NAD dealers (not Amazon, etc.).  The C268 is built on Hypex UcD Class D amplifier modules so in testing it we will get coverage on that as well.  Then again NAD says it is a custom version for them.The front panel looks good and substantial:The unit is nice and light to move around and inside has fair amount of space.  Back panel is nice in the way it provides both balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA input together with gain control:For my testing I used the fixed gain mode to get around any channel differential the potentiometers may introduce.Speaker terminals are nice and easy to use and naturally the unit is properly certified for safety and emissions.  Keep the later in mind as you compare it with any DIY version of the same amplifier modules.  With anything with mains input, I highly recommend sticking with products with safety certifications.In use, the amplifier runs completely cool to touch.  Not even above room temperature it seems.  It never, ever shut down no matter what I did to it.  This is one of the reasons you buy a separate amplifier by the way.  These power amplifiers are far more robust than any in any home theater AVR.Stereo Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard where we feed the amplifier a simple 1 kHz sine wave/tone and ask it to produce 5 watts into 4 ohm load (typical for many speakers).  This is what we get:For some reason the channel in blue has much more second harmonic causing its SINAD -- which is a sum of distortion and noise -- to suffer by 5 dB.  There is always some differential between stereo channels but this is a bit much.  This aside, performance is above average with a SINAD of 87 dB once averaged (click on graph for larger size):Covering the basics, frequency response is very good:Crosstalk (one channel bleeding from one to the other) shape is unusual but fortunately it gives is near state-of-the-art performance where our hearing (more or less) is most sensitive:Noise performance is very good (much better than its distortion metric):You easily clear the CD/streaming content\\'s 16 bit dynamic range at almost any listening level.Getting fancy and using 32-tones to test for distortion/intermodulation we get what we already seen from the dashboard which is good:A power amplifier\\'s job is well, to produce power so let\\'s measure that starting with 4 ohm load:NAD rates the amplifier at 80 watts for both 4 and 8 ohm loads which is unusual.  Fortunately we are beating that with our 4 ohm load, getting 96 watts.As noted earlier, noise performance is very good as indicated by how low the red graphs are until distortion sets in and the graph starts to flatten and rise.  But then we hit a very hard wall at the end.  This is an amp that will sound good until it doesn\\'t.  You will instantly know its power limit for good or bad.There is some hidden good news here though.  Let\\'s measure power at 1% distortion+noise both continuous (like above) and burst:Wow, many switching amplifiers don\\'t produce much more power in burst mode.  Here, we are getting more than double the power to the tune of 230 watts while both channels driven!  This means for momentary musical peaks, you have much more power available than our standard non-burst tests show.Switching to 8 ohms we get what the company advertises:All of these power tests are at just one frequency: 1 kHz.  Let\\'s now run the same power sweep into 4 ohm load but vary the frequency:With class D amps, I expect these lines to have many different shapes and be all of the place.  Instead, they land right on top of each other which is an ideal response.  If you look to the right before clipping occurs though, you see that at the two ends of the spectrum -- 20 and 20,000 Hz -- power does get limited.  20 kHz doesn\\'t need much power as music spectrum is quite low.  But 20 Hz does and loss of power is unfortunate but very common.  The peaks at low frequencies last a while due to their slow \"speed\" (rate of change) which taxes the power supply causing it to run out of juice at lower power levels.Amplifier Bridged Mode PerformanceI usually don\\'t test bridged mode but knowing you rascals, you will immediately ask for it since NAD emphasizes this a lot.  So let\\'s reconfigure the amp into a single channel and see what we get:Company advertises 300 watts but that is likely at higher distortion than what I use in the above graph.  To approximate their performance, let\\'s use the 1% THD+N threshold again and measure again:Now we get the 300 watts continuous.  And better yet, we get close to half a kilowatt of power for peaks!  Nicely done.ConclusionsThe value proposition of the NAD C268 amplifier doesn\\'t look very good at first blush.  Just 80 watts per channel for $900?  Testing shows while that is more or less the continuous power level, for short duration the amplifier can provide far more power.  Combined with the nice and safe build quality, the C268 won my heart.As such, I am going to put the NAD C268 on my recommended list.',\n",
       " ' NAD M10 streaming amplifier and DAC.  It was purchased and drop shipped to me kindly by a member.  It costs US $2,749 from NAD dealers.The M10 sports a very large touch screen LCD display that covers the entire front face:Sorry for leaving the protecting plastic on.  Like to keep things as new as possible for members.As nice as the display is, it simply is not as responsive as your phone or tablet.  What could be really cool such as the VU meter mode, becomes a jittery display that doesn\\'t please much.  A much faster processor with GPU would be needed to really make the display the star.  Still, it is heads and shoulders above others that have small displays.The back panel is notable for inclusion of HDMI ARC input:Alas, I have no ARC capability on my workstation so could not test that feature.In normal use the plastic case barely gets warm.  Under heavy stress of power testing, it got somewhat warm making me wish the case was made out of aluminum than plastic.  You are not likely to push the switching amplifiers this hard and at any rate, the M10 runs much cooler than any Audio/Video Receiver.While I did not have time to test it, the M10 comes with Dirac Room EQ which is nice.I noticed one operational/design issue.  I unplugged the unit to take its picture but noticed that the display went crazy flashing random stuff.  I thought it was a capacitor that was discharging but this continued and would not stop!  I looked in the back and I realized I still had the HDMI cable plugged in.  Knowing that it provides a 5 volt \"hot plug\" signal, I disconnected it and the display finally shut down.  This is improper design.  The device must NOT draw any power out of HDMI connection.DAC Audio MeasurementsI connected the Coax output of my Audio Precision APx555 analyzer to the M10 and measured what came out of the pre-out with volume adjusted for 2 volt output:Distortion is quite low at -110 dB (near threshold of hearing) but the noise floor kept jumping up and down causing SINAD to vary with it.  This shows lack of isolation between sensitive DAC subsystem and busy processor running other functions of the device.  As it is, performance is respectable which is a sigh of relief:Anything in green and blue is good.Testing at other output levels shows that the M10 is capable of pumping out good bit of voltage:Dynamic range clears the bar for 16 bit CD/streaming content but not much more:IMD distortion versus level shows the same noise issue:Filter response also shows higher than it should be noise floor:Jitter and noise test shows a lot of unwanted tones but audibly they are below threshold of hearing:Linearity is very good:EDIT: forgot to include multitone in the original review:Finally, we see the penalty of the DAC filter not being sharp enough in distortion+noise versus frequency:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI was hoping that analog input was not digitized but alas, it is:And at very low sample rate.  Maybe there is a setting to change this but I did not bother to look.Using the same analog input, I witnessed wild swings in noise floor of the unit:So I abandoned the analog input and switched to Coax for the rest of the amplifier tests:Performance is improved and stable as well.  This rates the M10 above average for more than 100 amplifiers tested so far:Signal to noise ratio is disappointing as even with full power, it barely clears the 16 bit hurdle:Frequency response using digital input is wide enough:But for those people with ultra sensitive high frequency hearing, you will lose half a dB at 20 kHz.Let\\'s see how much clean power we get out of M10 starting with 4 ohm load:I allowed the distortion to go higher (1%) and got even more power:I tried to get the burst power rating but some kind of limiter in the M10 was fighting the analyzer and wouldn\\'t allow me to get there.  It was nice that it would not shut down.Power naturally drops at 8 ohm:ConclusionsPerformance of the NAD M10 is generally acceptable especially for a multifunction device where we see a lot of fails.  Alas issues here and there took away my enthusiasm for it.  There is no excuse for poor analog input performance in a nearly $3000 device.  Or rather high and variable noise floor.So overall, I gave it a \"like it\" panther award but it is not something I would personally buy.  I can be stubborn that way!',\n",
       " ' Teac AX-501 integrated power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The AX-501 is part of the reference series from Teac so doesn\\'t come cheap as desktop products go.  I see the price at USD $999 on Amazon plus $35 shipping.  There is a discount for silver a USD $899 but Amazon doesn\\'t sell it for some reason.When I reviewed the Teac HA-501 Headphone Amplifier, I heaped praise over its modern retro look.  The AX-501 takes that to an entirely different level with addition of a couple of super cute, yellow background VU meters:What is that?  I should have took the shot with the VU meters working and the light turned on?  Well, the owner played a cruel joke on me by not supplying me with the remote and leaving the setting to off for the VU meter!!!  The controls are almost as nice of the HA-501 with the exception of the volume control which feels a bit stiff and has some slack in it.  Otherwise, there is nothing to fault it as far as I am concerned.Here is the back panel:XLR inputs should be mandatory in this price range and I am glad to see then included here (that is the way I ran all of my tests).  The AX-501 uses a class-D amplifier and runs as cool as you could get in my testing.  I don\\'t think it ever got even warm.  Class D also means light weight and that is NOT the case here. The AX-501 is a very hefty unit for its size.  This means it stays put no matter how heavy your cables are.Notice the lawyers getting their hands on the unit as to indicate the class of speaker wiring you are supposed to use!  But hey, it is good to know the unit has been through corporate filter of certification and regulation.Even though Teac is a Japanese company, the AX-501 is made in China.Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard view using XLR inputs:Even though Teac specs the AX-501 at 1 watt, we see the same performance at 5 watts which is nice. Distortion and noise as stated in SINAD dB puts the AX-501 above average (of 74 dB):It loses to SONOS Amp using its digital input and ever so slightly outperforms the Amazon Link Amp.Signal to noise ratio matches company spec:Frequency response shows identical output for both channels which is a relief as poorly made class-D amps differ in this regard:Roll off is early for my taste.  I like to see flat response to 40  kHz. That said, early filtering seems to help bring stability to performance of the low cost class D amps and I saw that here as I measured power output:There is a broad operating range where performance is good between 1 and 30 watts.  We then run out of juice and clipping occurs at 88 watts.  Rated output is 100 watts although higher resolution measurement may have gotten us closer.The Amazon Link Amp has more power and SONOS even more.  You are guaranteed to hear distortion when an amp reaches its max power rating so on this all important metric, the Teac AX-501 loses to its cheaper rivals.  And of course we are worlds away compared to reference amps like those based on Hypex NC-400.I have added a new test to my power amplifier suite and that is intermodulation distortion relative to measured power.  I ran it against the recently reviewed Klipsch PowerGate Amplifier: We see more evidence of the stability and clean performance of Teac AX-501 as switched/class D amplifiers go.  The IMD graph is also more revealing of distortion set it around 7 to 8 watts and climbing before final clipping.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI ran a sampling of my headphone tests starting with power versus distortion using 300 ohm load:Wow, this is impressive amount of output power at such a high impedance.  I wonder if we are just looking at the output of the power amplifier, reduced with an in-line resistor.  Here is the results with 33 ohm load:Oh, this is not nearly as good.  The reason is this:Sadly, we have a high value resistor in series with the output to the tune of 58 ohm.  I don\\'t like to see a value much more than 10 ohm and ideally, down to 1 to 2 ohm.Best use would be high impedance headphone with relatively flat impedance graph versus frequency.  Otherwise some \"color\" will be imparted on the sound (for good or bad).ConclusionsPersonally I think Teac has nailed the look and feel of such a desktop product.  The AX-501 is in an entirely different class, rivalling Nagra when it comes to switch-gear and meters.  In that regard it is a \"bargain.\"The power amplifier seems competent without hairy corner cases.  It is above average in performance but not rising up to the levels I like to see for $1,000.  As I noted in the review. power is everything and there are much better choices in that regard such as SONOS Amp.  At nearly half the price, it delivers more than twice the power plus a bunch of other features such as included streaming/DAC.  It doesn\\'t look nearly as nice as Teac AX-501 though.The headphone output is a checklist item although it should sound very good with high impedance headphones (I did not test).The AX-501 runs cool and should be quite reliable and safe giving its pedigree.  Overall I \\'like\" the Teac AX-501 but can\\'t recommend it on performance or value.  We should be able to do better for $1,000 so the search continues.',\n",
       " ' Lexicon, first generation DD8, 8-channel amplifier.  It was purchased used by a member and drop shipped to me.  The DD8 came from collaboration of Harman with TI (chip company) to produce very low weight, switching amplifiers for BMW car audio system.  It was then later repurposed in this configuration for the Custom Integration (CI) industry.  It is actually rebranded by a number of companies and sold under their label. Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman products which includes Lexicon.  So keep potential bias in mind as you read this review.All 8 channels are provided in one compact, very cool running 1U rack mount chassis:A stout on off switch manages power duties together with heftiest relay sound you have heard!  The back will seem unusual for hi-fi market but is precisely what the custom integration channel needs:You can either feed the unit individually per channel or a \"bus\" input that feeds the same stereo input to all the channels.  The latter is very handy for \"whole house audio\" where the same music plays in every room from ceiling speakers and such.  A looped bus output is provided to cascade more of these units.Output is provided through phoenix connectors which again is common and desired in CI channel as they are secure but small connectors.  Individual gain controls are provided for every channel.  You can also select mono vs stereo (again, useful in whole house audio where you usually want mono).  And auto-sensing for channels not used.  Trigger is also provided of course.The available units are pulled out of existing installs so likely have many hours on them.  And if the installer didn\\'t know what he was doing, it may have been subjected to high temps.  Indeed the first unit the owner bought did not work right, changing its gain with temperature.  I traced it to the front-end of the unit.  So know what you are getting if you buy them used.Brand new, second generation DD8s cost US $3,500 (through dealer channels). This version listed for US $2,500.  I see them listed for $1,300 right now on ebay but I believe the owner was able to get it much cheaper.Lexicon DD8 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard.  I set the gain to max which nicely gave me 29 dB which is what I have standardized on:This is above average performance with distortion kept below 100 dB;Noise performance is good as well:Ideally we would get 16 bits at 5 watts but 15 is a good effort.I was disappointed by the early cut off from the output filter:This is due to rather low switching frequency of 250 kHz (common values are in 300 to 400 kHz), which made the filter harder to design:Crosstalk is fine:Power into 4 ohm is rather low:The protection circuit was aggressive which made getting max and peak power difficult.  Still I managed to get some numbers:While we get more burst power courtesy of power supply designed for a lot more channels than two, max power with 1% THD+N still was rather low.I then tested the amp using 8 ohm and surprisingly, it produces more power there:To see how the power scales, I measured max power using two and four channels.  Both were the same using 8 ohm:Most disappointing was varying the frequency and producing a power sweep:As you see, there is huge penalty at higher frequencies.  Furthermore, there are power related linearities.ConclusionsIn mid to low frequencies, the DD8 produces well above average performance.  Above that frequency though, distortion increases substantially and other non-linearities surface.  Output seems to have some load dependency while also rolling off early.If you can get the unit for a few hundred dollars, then its compact enclosure and general performance may be a steal.  You could almost push me to recommend it but I am not going to.  I like to see better performance with respect to frequency response and high frequencies.   I think for its intended custom install market, it is perfect (our company has installed a lot of these).  For hi-fi use, you have to make that decision.',\n",
       " ' Outlaw 2200 single-channel amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 2200 costs US $399 plus shipping although I read that it goes on sale for less than that.I was surprised how svelte the 2200 is given its power capability:The diminutive size comes from \"class G\" implementation which varies the power supply with signal.  This sharply lowers the power loss at lower power levels allowing the heatsinks to be much smaller.   Despite its low \"1U\" height, the 2200 is heavy though courtesy of a larger pancake toroidal power transformer.It is always great to see balanced XLR input and trigger capability on amplifiers:In use, the 2200 was solid as a rock.  It never shut down or complain and ran very cool even after full suite of tests.  I was worried about recommendation to stack these from Outlaw but after testing, I think that can be done without much concern.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:SINAD is supposed to be sum of distortion and noise relative to our input signal.  Here, distortion is very low, approaching -105 dB.  So the fact that the SINAD is just 86 dB tells us that the number is dominated by noise as you will see shortly.  As it is, this is above average for some 75 amplifiers tested so far:Here is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and full power:Frequency response is a bit more limited than I like to see:Measured power at both 4 and 8 ohms exceed outlaw specifications:Even more power is on tap if you allow higher distortion or for momentary peaks:Wideband spectrum analysis shows very clean output:Those of you who are bothered by class D switching noise, should be happy to see this.  Indeed I performed all of my tests without an ultrasonic filter on my Analyzer.Thermal StabilityPerformance was rock solid from cold to operating temp:ConclusionsThe Outlaw 2200 monoblocks provides solid performance, easily besting the amps you get in a typical home theater AVR and then some.  Its slim packaging allows you to configure as many channels as you need without needing a lot of space.  Efficiency is good but doesn\\'t bring with it the light weight of the class D.  I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2200 amplifier.',\n",
       " ' Niles SI-2150 Class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  He purchased it refurbished and I see it for sale at $367.  Original cost seems to be US $850.By using efficient Hypex UcD250LP class D amplifier modules, the SI-2150 manages to fit in a small, 1U rack chassis:Niles is targeting this amp as Custom Integration (CI) channel so has good control as far as trigger and such:In use, the unit stayed cool and calm.  When pushed into clipping it will go into protection.  Sadly it stays in that mode until it is power cycled rather than recovering on its own.Nice set of gain controls are provided which lets you get precise channel matching -- something that is rarely the case in many amplifiers.  I set them to 29 dB for my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone dashboard into 4 ohm load:SINAD which is the ratio of distortion and noise versus signal is better than average at 85 dB:Signal to noise ratio ranks in the same region:Frequency response is flat enough in audible band:Power into 4 ohm shows good noise and distortion:Lots of power is available if we allow the distortion to rise to 1%:Response into 8 ohm load is rather odd:Usually we have a declining graph with hard clipping in solid state amplifiers, not this gradual rise in distortion.  As such, it was not easy to determine the clipping point as I normally do.Typical of class D amps, the relationship with frequency and power is complex:Removing my ultrasonic filter allows us to see the switching spectrum of the amplifier:ConclusionsI am not sure at the regular list price but at refurbished cost, this is a steal of an amplifier.  Lots of power in a cool, small enclosure with above average distortion and noise.I am going to put the Niles SI-2150 on my recommended list.',\n",
       " \" Peachtree amp500 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,499.The amp500 comes in the same packaging of many previous Peachtree products. I wish company would innovate here as the design looks kind of dated. Then again it is very unique.  This amplifier comes with balanced inputs which I very much like:When I pushed the amp, the protection circuit naturally kicked it but unlike many other amps, recovered automatically without the need for a power cycle.The back half of the box is empty so the amp module is small.  And there is plenty of ventilation on top.  There was only modest temperature rise in the case post all the testing I did which is admirable.Peachtree amp500 MeasurementsThe amplifier was ready on power up:Dashboard measurement shows above average performance:Noise+distortion as embodied in SINAD is well above median although well sort of state of the art:I could not come close to matching company spec for SNR:Frequency response was flat enough and not dependent on impedance which is very good for a class D amp:Crosstalk was state of the art so I am assuming some kind of dual mono configuration:Multitone was respectable:Let's see how power it pumps into a 500 watt load:That is a lot of power!  The clipping is quite sharp though which when combined with the protection circuit, would not allow me to measure max power.  But I did get peak power:I think spec is 700 watts but we are close enough.  Even at 8 ohm we have good bit of power:High frequencies bother the amp but go lower and linearity is excellent:Finally, we have a new test: power on noise:I haven't run this test on other amps to know if this is good or bad.  Once I do get some mileage on it, we will better know what is going on.  If I were to guess, I would say this is good performance.ConclusionsStory here is simple: tons and tons of power with above average noise and distortion.  A cool running switching amplifier in small package as well.  Really, nothing much to complain about here.I am going to recommend the Peachtree amp500.\",\n",
       " ' Outlaw 2220 single channel amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $399.The look is simple but elegant in its slim form factor.  I like that it is just heavy enough to give you confidence but not so much that you can\\'t lift it.Nice set of features are provided from balanced XLR input to trigger.  A larger toroidal transformer indicates class class AB design (not switching).Outlaw 2220 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm:I like the very low distortion spikes that are around -108 dB or so.  Some power supply noise (120 Hz) and general noise lower SINAD down to 85 dB which is still quite competent:Noise level could be a bit lower at 5 watts but still respectable:Multitone test shows the very low distortion of the amplifier:Frequency response is flat which is an improvement over the 2200 model which drooped at 20 kHz:The word \"monoblocks\" sets up expectations of high amount of power and the 2220 delivers:This should be plenty of power for just about any use.Finally we can examine performance at different frequencies:Some strange distortion mechanism sets in at highest frequencies but only during a limited power range (hump in green).  Fortunately you hardly ever have content at high frequencies at high amplitude so not an audible concern.ConclusionsPerformance of the Outlaw 2220 is solid, solid, solid!  What can I say.  It delivers what you expect with nary any results that raise an eyebrow sans that high frequency distortion.  You have ton of power which should be handy for both stereo music listening and home theater.  At $399 it brings great value as well.I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2220 monoblock amplifier.',\n",
       " ' all-in-one Marantz HD-AMP1 DAC and integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and retails for USD $1,100 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.The unit has a somewhat retro looking of other Marantz audio products with the round digital display and wood sides:There are both digital inputs and analog allowing one to build a complete system around the HD-AMP1.  I was surprised to not see RCA outputs though so no convenient way to use its internal DAC by itself.Amplification is through class-D technology which allowed the unit to run cool.  Without permission from its owner though, I did not put it through thermal stress.In addition to speaker output, there is also a headphone jack so I tested the output through that too.There is a lot of functionality in HD-AMP1.  I chose to test a few of them in this feature and will test more based on requests.MeasurementsI started by testing the DAC+headphone stage using our usual dashboard:As you see, I set the output to 2 volt which is the nominal output of stand-alone DACs.  Alas, performance is nothing to write home about.  Second harmonic distortion is quite high, setting the SINAD at just 85 dB.  This would put in the fourth quadrant of DACs tested (with one being the best).  We also have fair bit of harmonic spikes from the power supply from 180 Hz and up (multiple of 60 Hz mains frequency in US).Loading down the headphone output with 300 ohm, we get this:There are internal gain settings but I did not mess with them.  As it is, level of noise and distortion is quite high relative to desktop DAC+amp products.  Power output however is decent.Switching to the power amplifier, here is the power versus distortion+noise measurement:I have plotted three graphs using three different volume controls with input being swept up to 2 volts.  Distortion climbs less steeply than other amps so hard to know where to stop and measure the wattage.  I selected a conservative point and got 47 watts.  I believe the rating from Marantz is 70 watts using my 4 ohm load.    You could certainly get there and beyond if you tolerate more distortion.As I have noted, the performance is similar to budget amplifiers like NuForce STA-200 (dashed green) but not even remotely getting close to our best in class Hypex NC400 amplifier (dashed blue).  Best case performance is about SINAD of 72 dB or so.Above is with my 40 kHz AES-17 filter by the way.Frequency response was very good for a class D amplifier:And here is the broadband spectrum analysis of a 1 kHz tone:The first large spike comes at nearly 500 kHz which I am assuming is the switching frequency of its class-D amplifier.  Its second harmonic is at nearly 1 Mhz and down -60 dB.Finally, here is the harmonic distortion+noise versus frequency at 5 watts of output using 90 kHz of bandwidth:Once again, it is not on the same planet as the Hypex NC400.  It also has instability when the analyzer switches its frequency as indicated by the \"T\" symbols.  It takes some 5 seconds for the readings to become stable.  We saw this in the Behringer A500 amplifier review.ConclusionsI wanted to like the Marantz HD-AMP1.  It has been in demand for quite a while on the forum to measure it. Having done that, I see no signs of excellence. It follows the drifting backward industry trend of \"good enough\" performance specs.  This is reflected in lack of hardly any specifications provided by Marantz.  On feature side, it is very strange that there is no RCA outputs to use the DAC and pre-amp with a different power amplifier.Needless to say, I can\\'t recommend the Marantz HD-AMP1.',\n",
       " 'This is a follow up to my first test of the Cambridge Audio CXA81.  Results there showed fair bit of noise which was uncharacteristic of other products I have tested from the company.  There were a lot of speculation as to the source of the problem but no data to back any. Fortunately company CEO was kind enough to contact me about a week later expressing surprised at my results. I asked them if they have measurements that are better.  After some investigation, they said that they could replicate my results at their China manufacturing facility but not their R&D lab. I expressed that I no longer had the unit so there was not any work I could do to get to the bottom of this.  I was offered a new unit and offer for payment to test again. I accepted the second unit but turn down the offer of payment.In the communication, I was asked (as some members had also suggested) whether I lifted the USB ground using the switch in the back.  I had not and ran those tests on the second unit.  This is with the unit grounded:The low frequency noise was much lower in this sample but you can still see the channel in red showing a wide spectrum of high frequency noise.  This reduced its sinad fair bit compared to the \"good\" channel.  Lifting the ground made that better but created a new problem:At first it appears that there is more harmonic distortion given the spikes at 2, 3,4, 5, etc. KHz.  But that is not so.  USB micro packets are 1 Kbytes each and frame boundaries are showing up there as leakage from digital to analog circuits.  So lifting the ground is really not a good solution here although I appreciate it being there as it may help some systems.Post this we had a conference call with the designers of the product.  Issue was brought up that this is an instrumentation thing that the Audio Precision analyzer is creating a loop and ground noise that would not be there.  While this is true, I explained that I have tested hundreds of DACs that don\\'t have this problem.  I have once in a while seen this but it is exceptionally rare.  Since overall results were more positive than the first sample, I offered to re-run all the measurements and post them.A problem which we did NOT have a disagreement was, was the output limit of the pre-out.  Like many AVRs, this is lower than I like to see at 1.5 volt.  Above that it will saturate and distortion will increase.With this intro, let\\'s get into the measurements.  Company has seen all the measurements and agrees with them.CXA81 DAC Measurements (Sample 2)I wanted to break the electrical link between the analyzer and CXA81 so started my DAC testing using Toslink optical. Here is our dashboard:Note how I have picked the max output before output saturating.  If we sweep the input level we see the full range of output relative to distortion:As you see at 2 volts, we get down to SINAD of 75 dB which is what I measured with the first sample at that output.I next switched to USB input:We see noise intrusion reducing SINAD by a few dBs relative to TOSLINK optical.  Here is a key discovery though: this is NOT due to USB input but mere connection of USB cable.  You can see that noise even with Toslink when I have USB plugged in (but not used as an input):Turns out this noise issue will proceed to corrupt the measurements of all other subsystems and was the reason why the amplifier for example did not perform well either in the first round.  The impact with this second unit is lower than first sample though.  This could be due to noise conditions changing on my test system (nature of computers and grounding) or something is different in the second sample.To eliminate USB noise as a factor I continued the rest of DAC tests using Toslink so let\\'s go through them quickly:Linearity test was impacted by another rare issue which is power supply noise very close to the test tone of 200 Hz I use here.  There is a strong bandpass filter here but not enough to get rid of that:We see clear jitter sources but they are benign audibly:IMD test shows more noise than I like to see but is very good at the limit, beating my reference DAC in blue:Here is our reconstruction filter:And THD+N vs frequency:Pre-amp MeasurementsHere again we see the impact of connecting the USB cable or not while testing analog in/analog out:Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard:This is above average for all amplifiers tested to date and far better than noise-induced measurements of the first sample.  Distortion is at -100 dB which is very good.Power sweeps are much improved due to lower noise:We see that in various frequencies as well:The lower amount of noise allows distinction between the test tones.ConclusionsThe second sample combined with not connecting USB cable shows CXA81 in much better light.  Performance is competent now for the class and transparent for most uses.  Where would one put the blame for noise being induced using USB?  Me? Instrumentation? Vagueness of computer audio/grounding?  Some or all of the above?  When testing AVRs, I have started testing with Toslink to remove issues related to HDMI.  I should have opted to do the same here but did not since I consider the unit in a different class.  Still, I take some blame and should have done this before returning the unit. As I expressed to the company though, this is not a problem that other devices have so I implore them to investigate how to use this variability. After all, your system may be much worse than my configuration as your downstream devices and upstream computer may present even a worse situation. One likes to take comfort in thinking \"one digital input is the same as another.\"As it is, you have the tough situation that you can\\'t leave USB cable connected lest you degrade the performance of the rest of the system.  If you don\\'t have an audible issue, this is not a concern but if it is, experiment with removing USB cable and see if fixes the problem.For me personally, USB connection is critical and about the only input I would use on such a combo device.  So the above is not something that works for me.  But may be fine for you.I also like to see output levels of 2 volts for unbalanced without saturating.  We are seeing AVR/AVP companies going this way.  No reason to do different in a combo device like this.  Higher output level gives better freedom to use external amplifiers.Finally, let me express my sincere and deep appreciate for Cambridge Audio and company CEO for accepting the challenging results of the first test and working with me on better clarity and a constructive path forward.  In that regard, they earn highest levels of respect from me.  I look forward to quality products from them that come across my bench.',\n",
       " ' Allo Volt+ D class D amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $129 in this \"dual mono\" configuration with stepped attenuator.I am not a big fan of these clear cases but in this case, pun intended, it works!Hard to take a picture of it though without heavily accentuating dust and such that normally is not visible:Dual TI TPA2116 class D amplifiers are used plus a front-end switching power supplies to generate the required plus and minus supplies.Not that no power supply comes with this amplifier.  You have a choice of what you put in there.  I used my lab power supply at its max setting of 31 volts and 3 amps.  It could use more than 3 amps with 4 ohm load as the power supply current limited near max power sweeps.  It was fine with 8 ohm load though as that doesn\\'t need as much current.There is no remote control so this is really a desktop amplifier.  There is a gain switch below that switches between 19 and 26 dB.  I used the default 19 dB which works well with desktop DACs that have no trouble producing near 2 volts you need for max power.Overall the Volt+ D makes a very positive impression with respect to looks and build quality.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is nice!  Budget class D amps routinely produce SINAD in 55 to 65 dB and here we are well above that at 84 dB:I was also impressed with how low the noise floor was at 5 watt playback:Many amplifiers fail to achieve 96 dB which is my target for this level of playback.Crosstalk is superb, better than just about any amp I have tested recently:Frequency response has a tiny bit of roll off at 20 kHz:As I noted in the introduction, with 4 ohm load my power supply lacks enough current so I also tested with one channel driven:So it seems that getting the 60 watt advertised power level is possible.Taking advantage of onboard capacitors, I ran my burst test:So even in stereo you have over 60 watts, going to nearly 90 watts with one channel.Power into 8 ohm load is naturally lower:Notice that noise floor is very low contributing to very good response at lower power levels.Varying the frequency gives us the following power levels and distortion:At or below 1 kHz response is excellent and frequency independent.  Above that it varies which is typical of many class D amps.Finally, I ran a spectrum analysis without my usual class D amp filter in the path:Wow, TI put some clever filtering/design in there.  Usually the switching frequency is down just 10 to 2 dB from our main tone.  Here, nothing rises above -88 dB or so!  TI advertises that the amp will not interfere with AM radio and it definitely won\\'t.ConclusionsThe Allo Volt+ D amplifier is a delightful surprise.  Careful design has elevated the performance of these switching \"chip amplifiers\" to that of mass market hifi/class AB designs.  Yet, it runs cool and costs very little.  Yes, you need an external power supply and that is the only flaw I see with going with this solution.  Overall, I am happy to recommend the Allo Volt+ D for its nice and elegant design and performance especially at this price.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of Amazon Echo Link Amp power amplifier, DAC and network streamer.  I purchased this from Amazon for USD $299 and it arrived yesterday.While rather featureless from front, the overall feel of the plastic and case is quite good:When you rotate the volume control white LEDs light up to show a coarse volume control.  They time out very quickly though so I could not capture them on the camera.Not sure what the hole is for.  Maybe it is for a remote control but none was provided.The back panel is the more interesting bit:In addition to the power amplifier, we have a nice little DAC and pre-amplifier here.  There are digital inputs in the form of both Coax and Toslink S/PDIF.  And of course we also have streaming capability with the Ethernet jack and wifi.  Surprisingly we also have S/PDIF and Toslink output for digital connectivity to other DACs and amplifiers.There is analog input and output.  Former can be used for your analog gear and the latter, for use as a DAC or pre-amp.  There are issues with this mode though.  See later in measurement section.Operationally the Link Amp runs very cool.  However at higher power there is an audible mechanical hissing sound likely caused by resonance of an internal inductor.  It was audible to me from 3 feet away without use of speakers (dummy loads).As you can imagine for a product with Amazon name of it, there is a professional looking label underneath with every regulatory and safety certification you would want to see.  This is important as the Link Amp like many other power amplifiers is mains operated with a lot of high power circuits.  Oddly there is no power button.Sadly there is hardly any documentation provided with the unit.  You are supposed to seek help in the Alexa app.  I naively assumed that connecting ethernet cable would mean the Link Amp wout get instantly recognized by the app but such was not the case.  I had to configure it using Wifi with the mess that is: connecting to local ad-hoc wifi it creates and then using the main home network.  Process was quite non-intuitive and took multiple reboots of phone and link amp to get it to finally recognize it.  Boy, do I miss the simplicity of the original echo.  Oddly, Alexa app provides no control over inputs!  I just fed it S/PDIF and it output that. Ditto for analog.  Can't tell what priority it will use if both are active.There is a volume control in the app but it only controls local/streaming content, not the volume control on the Amp.  Really?  The volume control is digital so why can't I control it in the app???Amazon has really lost its way here with respect to software here.  Added complexity over time has not been managed.Also at fault is the computer and networking industry that has not invented a new revision of Wifi standard that just works with devices like this.Overall, my impression of hardware is positive and software negative.Anyway, let's get into measurements.  With so much functionality here, I have chosen a subset to test, mostly focusing on the amplifier performance.DAC MeasurementsI was happy to see line out so thought we can check the performance of the DAC this way.  Alas, this was not meant to be as without a load, the amplifier shuts down when you turn up the volume to max to get the nominal voltage you like to see on a DAC.  There should be a software option to turn off the power amp so it doesn't do that.  So I had to connect my dummy loads to the amp to test it.  Here is the outcome:The power amplifier reduced performance by about 5 dB. SINAD was 92 dB or so without the load.  The current values put the Link Amp in the lower tier of DACs tested:It would have gone into a tier higher if I didn't have to run the power amplifier along with it.Here is the DAC frequency response which was promoted by later test results:The 44.1 kHz sampling results are fine.  What is not fine is that no matter what other sample rate you use, you get the same bandwidth!  In other words, while higher sample rates are accepted, everything seems to be down sampled to 44.1 or 48 kHz.  So forget any dreams you have of high resolution audio.Power Amplifier MeasurementsImportant note before we get into this section: during testing the results were a complete mess at lower frequencies.  The graphs were literally not readable with very high variations of THD+N.  So I spent a few hours with my son working through it and turned out some of these class-D amps cause frequency modulation at low frequencies which throws off the analyzer notch filter.  The result was that THD+N would go from correct value to 20%+ which would totally screw things up on the graph.  I found a good work-around for this which made the measurements look a lot nicer.  Alas, this means you can't quite compare these results to previous measurements where this issue was visible.  Fortunately we had very clean amplifiers such as Hypex NC400 without this issue so those results stand.Let's start with power amplifier dashboard st 5 watts using digital input:When I tested the SONOS Amp there was a lot of degradation with analog input so let's test that:Ah, a sigh of relief.  Performance actually improves a bit using analog in!  Noise floor is flatter and lower although not enough to make the SINAD any different.  Putting that value in context of other power amplifiers tested, we get this:I updated this graph with the digital input of SONOS which nicely outperforms the Link Amp.  However, as noted with analog input the Amazon Link Amp is much better.Frequency response with digital input shows the same bandwidth limitation that the DAC did:Same test with analog input shows a droop at low frequencies as well:Note that even when using analog input, you are limited to the same 24 kHz bandwidth!  Someone didn't want you to mess with high resolution audio no matter what.  That aside, there is now a low frequency roll off too.Here is the signal to noise ratio:Let's deal with the most important test: power output versus distortion and noise:Compared to other budget amps like the $199 Topping TP60, there is much more power here and at lower noise and distortion.  Don't like one channel having more distortion though.A more direct competitor is the SONOS amp which costs twice as much but otherwise has streaming functionality:The Link Amp has better noise level but that is because SONOS has poor performance with its analog input.  The SONOS has tons more power and its two channels are staying in synch.  So the SONOS is a better deal here putting the cost aside.  Of course neither comes remotely close to our reference Hypex NC400 DIY build (at > $1,000).There has been some interest in running jitter tests on these power amplifiers.  So here is a snapshot of that:The THD+N versus level and frequency where my new tests show much cleaner results:Note that I have limited the bandwidth to 61 kHz. That is enough to capture the third harmonic of 20 kHz but low enough to keep the ultrasonic noise that these amps have.  I will show that in a bit.  Here we see that distortion rises with low and high frequencies.  The curve though matches how our hearing works in that we are much less sensitive in low and high frequencies so the distortion products are likely not audibly a problem.  Note then that testing at 1 khz shows the best case scenario for these class D amplifiers.I have another variation of above where I sweep the level/power and keep the frequency the same:We see that at 20,000 Hz, the two channels perform the same.  But as soon as we lower the test to 2,000 Hz and then 200 Hz, one channel gets a lot worse. This tells me there is insufficient power supply capacitor reserve for one channel than for the other.  The lower frequencies are more taxing this way because they stay at their extreme peaks of the sine wave longer.Lastly, here is our ultrasonic spectrum of a 1 kHz tone:We see our sharp spike around 600 kHz indicating that is the switching frequency.  The rise in ultrasonics around 100 khz shows noise shaping (pulling noise out of audible band and stuffing it here).  Levels for these are quite low as class-D amps go, showing good attention to filtering, no doubt helped with the limited bandwidth of 24 kHz.ConclusionsMechanically and from safety and emissions point of view, Amazon Echo Link amp delivers for just $299.  This puts it way ahead of many offerings in this price range which are more akin to DIY efforts than a polished product.  On top of that, you have streaming, DAC and a digital and analog pre-amplifier.  This is a lot and I suspect Amazon is losing money on each one or barely breaking even.While some attention has been paid to produce a performant product, there are clear limitations and issues here and there.  Limiting of the bandwidth to 24 khz in all modes is a miss objectively but not subjectively.  As with other class D amps, we have odd behavior here and there such as rise in low frequency distortion, ultrasonic noise.The mechanical whistling while the amp is pushed should have been caught and fixed although in practice, the music should mask that well.At $299 with so many features and generally good performance, I am going to go ahead and put the Amazon Echo Link Amp on my recommended list.  No, it is no audiophile find.  But for secondary use its performance is good enough to make it a good buy.\",\n",
       " \" Peachtree GAN400 stereo balanced (input) amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,499.I am not generally a fan of peachtree audio product looks but this one in coffee stain looks pretty good.  Other than a power switch, not much else is there.  Ditto on the back side:The claim to fame of this amplifier is use of GaN transistors which in theory simplify the design of a class D amplifier (a bit) and improve its efficiency (a bit).  And in theory, it can also produce lower distortion (in open loop anyway).  The drawback is much higher cost of the transistors compared to MOSFETs.  Let's see if the performance is there.Peachtree GAN400 MeasurementsI performed all of my testing using XLR input.  Let's start with our usual input of 1 kHz with output into 4 ohm to the tune of 5 watts:There is fair bit of inconsistency between the channels with respect to SINAD.  I switched my loads and issue persisted so it is not my setup.  Averaging the two we get 84 dB which is slightly average for all amps tested but not where performance should be:Frequency response is disappointing as it shows load dependency:This means that the high frequency response will be speaker dependent which is not good.  I expect this kind of performance in ultra budget amplifiers (under $100), not at this price.Noise performance is good but again, not where it should be:Same for multitone distortion:Crosstalk however, is superb indicating two independent amplifiers:There is lots of power both at 4 and 8 ohms:As noted though, the curve starts to go up prior to clipping which means distortion is increasing.The amplifier more than meets its 400 watt spec at 1% THD:The shape of THD+N graph is very smooth which perhaps could be attributed to GaN transistor design:There is no pop on power up but there is when you shut it down:The amp is stable on power up so no need to leave it on:Peachtree GAN400 Power Stress TestWith the owner's permission , I subjected the amp to varying load angle (phase) and down to 2 ohm impedance.  It did very well:Variations of ±60 degrees did not bother it at all at either 4 or 8 ohm.  A bit strangely, at 2 ohm it would not run with 0 load angle but did produce half the output at other angles (hard to see in the 3-D graph).  Since minimum impedance is 2.5 oh, we can't fault it for this.  FYI I tested a couple of amps at my disposal and the both got quite unhappy with varying phase angles, shutting down and such.  Whereas the GAN400 marched through this test without once going into protection.ConclusionsI just bought a 65 watt GaN based USB-C charger and am amazed at how small it is.  The buzz from there has travelled to audio and has resulted in GaN based amps like this Peachtree.  Alas, there is no performance advantage that can be seen in this implementation.  Noise+Distortion is only slightly better than average and far cry from top performing amplifiers we have tested in the past.  Combine this with quite high price of $2,500 and this is a difficult offer to swallow.  Good news is that there is plenty of power at 400+ watts independent of the load (4 or 8 ohm).Personally I don't see a reason to pay so much for this level of performance so I can't recommend the Peachtree GAN400 amplifier.\",\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A07 Pro stereo amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs about $90.As you see the distinguishing factor from some of the other Aiyima amplifiers is inclusion of tone controls. Alas, that is also where the problem is with this unit: there is no detent and no way of setting its response to flat. Worse yet small changes in the dials will make large differences in tonality. So while I like having toner controls, I definitely like to see a tone defeat feature.  Otherwise the unit feels nice to use and operate.  As is typical, the power supply is much larger than the amplifier itself:AIYIMA A07 Pro MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into a pure 4 ohm load, driven to stereo at 5 watts:We expect good performance from AIYIMA and we get it:Switching to my PowerCube Loadbox, we can simulate more complex loads: (1 channel tested)As you see, performance is essentially the same.Noise performance is good enough for this class of budget amplifiers:Multitone shows good performance:Frequency response unfortunately is load (speaker) dependent:So you may be forced to use the treble control to adjust high frequency response for your speaker.Crosstalk is very good:Let's get into all important power measurements starting with 4 ohm:This is plenty for desktop use.  Switching to 8 ohm naturally robs us of fair amount of power:Fortunately vast majority of speakers on the market are 4 ohm nominal.To see stability of the amplifier, let's subject it to suite of loads and reactive components:An ideal amplifier would follow the red line.  We are essentially there for both 8 and 4 ohm.  Surprisingly this little amp managed to also keep running at 2 ohm, albeit without capacitive component and some power drop.  Many amps simply shut down and won't even work into 2 ohm.Edit: here is the response vs frequency that I forgot to post originally:Finally, here is the warm up profile:In use, the amplifier ran pretty cool.ConclusionsThe AIYIMA A07 Pro continues the tradition of the company providing competent levels of noise and distortion, good bit of power and very reasonable price.  While tone controls are a nice added feature, they lack a defeat switch.  And we have our usual load dependency.Personally I very much dislike the lack of tone control defeat so won't buy it.  But if that doesn't bother you, then the AIYIMA A07 Pro is another good bargain in stereo amplification.\",\n",
       " ' Peachtree Nova 300 integrated amplifier with DAC and phono stage.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,199.  The Nova 300 fits in the same chassis Peachtree has successfully used for last 15 years:It is quite beefy and heavy.  Volume indication overloads the LED indicators on the input selectors showing a coarse 8 levels.  For this price, I would expect an LED indicator of the actual level.Back panel shows good quality connectors and rich feature set for a desktop amplifier:Peachtree made its name on DACs and had quite a following 10 to 15 years ago.  I was curious to see if they had upgraded the DAC subsystem since that time so let\\'s start by measuring that subsystem.Peachtree Nova 300 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit over USB input, sampled the output from preamp out and adjusted the volume to output 2 volts:Well, this is quite disappointing.  Noise and distortion as represented by SINAD is in decidedly \"poor\" category in today\\'s market:The unit can output higher levels so let\\'s see where peak performance is:No luck there as the peak is actually at 1 volt out.Dynamic range is better indicating distortion is the problem:At this point I didn\\'t see a need to run more DAC tests and switched to testing the amplifier.Peachtree Nova 300 Amplifier MeasurementsFor this test I used the Aux analog input:Ah, this is very respectable and above average performance:SNR is not as good as I like at 5 watt but gets better at full power:Crosstalk is excellent:Frequency response shows a peaky filter though:Multi-tone results indicate \"good enough\" performance:What was most impressive is the amount of power available from the ICE amplifier module they are using:Since I am driving two channels, this is over 900 watts of power!  Indeed the peaks hit 1000+ watts:Even at 8 ohm there is copious amount of power available:Interesting to see little dependency on frequency until we hit a few watts:ConclusionsIt is clear from the measurements that the DAC subsystem is a relic that is simply behind times.  The product though benefits from using a competent B&O ICE module which has stayed competitive producing far more power than you would expect in a \"lifestyle\" product of this kind.  As such, I expect subjective performance of Nova 300 to be excellent regardless of what speaker you attach to it.  I usually don\\'t worry about price/performance in my reviews -- that is yours to worry about.    But here, the price seems quite high relative to the other internet focused amplifiers which have come out in the last couple of years.  Some of those are powerful and all of them cost a lot less than the Nova 300.Overall, I can\\'t recommend the Peachtree Nova 300 as a new purchase.  ',\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio BT20A stereo class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 IC. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $99.99 with 32 volt power supply.Despite its low cost, the case gives a feeling of quality. I am not usually fan of tone controls in low cost amps because you can never set them to flat response (the detents are there but don\\'t work). As you will in the measurements, Fosi has made sure that they work correctly in this instance.  A stout power switch controls power. In addition to 32 volt supply, company also shipped the optional ($40) 48 volt supply which is quite a giant:As you see, Bluetooth input is also supported.FYI there is an included orange volume control knob to give the unit some color.Fosi Audio BT20A Pro MeasurementsThe tests are in 48 volt unless I say otherwise (I had mistakenly assumed it was the standard, not the 32 volt).  Here is our dashboard:Notice the great channel match in addition to very good SINAD which represents noise and distortion.  Same is true with 32 volt supply:This nicely lands the BT20A Pro in the \"very good\" category of all amplifiers tested regardless of price:Zooming in to see the competition:SNR is good for the class:I expect load/impedance dependency in this class of switching amplifiers but here, the peaking is almost entirely out of band which is good:Seeing how you have tone controls anyway, you could tailor any peaking with adjustment of the treble control.  Won\\'t be exact but should be good enough.That aside, note how the response is more or less is flat in audible band with the treble and bass controls set to their detent, center position.Multitone is good enough for the class:Crosstalk is very good:Let\\'s start our 4 ohm power measurements with 48 volt supply:Wow, this little box can pump out some serious watts, albeit in the short term testing!  Switching to 32 volts cuts this down even though 4 ohm is mostly current limited:The larger power supply must have more capacitor reservoirs than the 32 volt.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally see the biggest hit to power: [Edit early version had the wattage wrong]Although to be fair, I put the cursor at an earlier point than for 48 volt supply (not enough measurement points there).I was pleasantly surprised by the transfer function being so smooth:Finally there is not much of a pop on but there is for off:ConclusionsThe TI TPA3255 seems to be a capable platform when paired with a good implementation which is what we have in BT20A Pro.  You get a sense of that in company marketing material which includes Audio Precision measurements.  Usability is excellent with high quality case and controls especially with respect to ability to set the tone controls to flat.It is also nice to see so much power coming out of this little box with the beefy 48 volt power supply, showcasing the advancements in amplification density we have today.As an aside, the company has been a joy to work with.  They were exceptionally polite, cordial and patient as I went through my testing and evaluation.  They tell me they have internal R&D team and it shows.I am happy to add the Fosi Audio BT20A Pro to my recommended list.',\n",
       " ' IOTAVX SA3 integrated stereo amplifier with built-in DAC and subwoofer output.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs £399.00 (on sale from £449.00) on company\\'s website.  Hard to find it on sale in US but found one ebay listing for $498.SA3 nails the industry design with svelte chassis, dot matrix display and judicious use of backlighting for the logo: I left the plastic on the display as otherwise it looks nicer than it does in the picture.  A reassuring power button is the left and a nice feeling rotary control handles the volume.  If you press it, it becomes an input selector.  Very nicely done.Back panel shows a lot of inputs:There is phono input which I did not test.  I did test both analog input and Toslink digital input.  Sadly there is no USB input.  There is bluetooth but no streaming support over network.Let\\'s get started by using the line in (analog) input to the power amp and work our way out to the DAC section.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWith integrated amplifiers with volume controls, I adjust that to produce roughly 29 dB of gain which is a THX \"standard.\"  That gives us this dashboard:Distortion dominates with second harmonic telling the full story.  Wish channel 2 was as good as channel 1 but this is typical.  Averaging the two we get this kind of ranking:So above average among 89 amplifiers tested so far (!).  But not state of the art by any stretch.Noise performance is good:You almost clear the CD\\'s 16-bit dynamic range at 96 dB at 5 watts output.Typical of class AB designs, bandwidth is abundant:Should the zombie apocalypse come, you can hook up a few hundred yards of wire to the speaker wire and have yourself an AM transmitter power amp!!!  A microphone and simple modulator and you could be talking to people thousands of miles away at night....Crosstalk is surprisingly good:If you look inside the chassis, you realize why.  A toroidal transformer is in the middle with each amplifier nicely separated from each other by good 8 to 10 inches.Power output at 4 ohms falls a bit short of the spec:And I am not too happy about the constant rise in distortion from just 1 watt, ending worse than one of our worse performing Audio Video Receiver (the NAD T758).It is a bit happier driving an 8 ohm load:That\\'s not a lot of power though so best get an efficient speaker is 8 ohm is the language it speaks.Fortunately burst power is quite decent (only 4 ohm shown):Changing the frequency of the test tone hardly bothers the SA3:Other topologies such as Class D make a mess out of this measurement.DAC Audio MeasurementsTaking advantage of the pre-amp output, I fired off a few DAC tests to get an idea of how good that subsystem is starting with our digital dashboard:OK, this is a bit disappointing.  You want a SINAD here that is 10 dB better than the amp for it to be transparent.  Here it is actually a couple of dB worse then the amplifier which means the combo will drag down the performance of the amplifier some.As a DAC, it falls in the failing (red) category of all DACs tested to date:Noise performance is decent:Intermodulation+noise test is disappointing:The upper line in orange is a phone dongle!  The SA3 hugs that performs like it is related to it which it should not be.Jitter performance looks better than it is due to high noise floor potentially hiding other spurious tones:So overall the DAC portion is barely a match for the amplifier.  If the amp gets the grade B, the DAC gets a C+.ConclusionsIt is nice to see a fresh take on the integrated stereo amplifier from IOTAVIX.  The SA3 looks attractive, has good feature set including many inputs from digital to analog and takes up little space. You can nicely put it under your monitor, add a couple of speakers and be in business.You don\\'t get to brag its measured performance but what is there \"is not broken\" which is often an accomplishment in world of audio.  Performance is solid across the board with the DAC trailing a bit.  I would happily use it in a secondary system.Overall, I am going to recommend the IOTAVIX SA2 amplifier.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of Living Sound Audio Electronics Voyager GAN 350 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US 3,000 from the company.I really like the high-end look of this amplifier case:Strange though as there is no power indicator, nor switch.  The latter is in the back only:I really dislike the hard to read type on the back.  Other than that, the connectors seem to be of good quality.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses GaN transistors to ostensibly lower distortion and increase efficiency of the amplification.  In use, the bottom where all the modules are mounted barely god warm so efficiency is good.LSA Voyager GAN350 MeasurementsI started my testing with XLR inputs which showed really odd results:As you see, the gain is nearly 10 dB different between the channels.  I looked for configuration switches but couldn't find anything.  After wasting half hour, I switched to RCA input and problem vanished:If I were to guess I would say the XLR input is miswired on one channel.  Bad execution if so in such an expensive amplifier.  For the rest of the test I stuck with RCA input.Signal to noise ratio while OK, is not state of the art:I like to see full 16 bit/96 dB dynamic range at 5 watts.  We fall short here.Frequency response was sad to see:Class D amplifiers have a low pass filter that can interact with the load if not designed well and that is what we have here.  The impact falls clearly in audible band.  This would be OK for a budget amplifier in $100 range but not in this class.  Depending on what speaker you hook up to this amplifier, the highs may be exaggerated or filtered.Crosstalk on the other hand was exceptional due to dual mono design and no crosstalk through the power supply:Multitone performance was also very good, indicating low intermodulation distortion:Power was healthy into 4 ohm albeit with unexceptional distortion and noise levels:There is still plenty of power available even into 8 ohm:Interesting how distortion keeps rising and clipping is rather soft.  As they state, this indicates low amount of negative feedback.Transfer function is frequency dependent with distortion rising quite a bit at higher frequencies (likely due to that low feedback level):Spectrum of switching frequency shows good attenuation but not that high of a frequency:If they had opted for higher speed which GaN transistors allow, the impact of the output filter would have been lower (and possibly above audible band).The amplifier doesn't need any warm up as it is stable on power on:ConclusionsOther than having a lot of power and good efficiency, there is not much else to be happy here.  Clearly companies are using GaN as a buzzword without fully taking advantage of what it can provide.  Lots of money is left on the table here in many areas from frequency response load dependency to high amount of distortion.  At the end of the day, you have an expensive, high power amplifier here with average performance.I can't recommend the LSA Voyager GAN 350.  Performance is not there, nor is quality control.Edit: teardown just posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...a-voyager-gan-350-teardown-class-d-amp.28208/\",\n",

It was sent to me by the company and costs US $139.99.It is so nice to see a VU meter on an amplifier!  This one actually seems high quality with nice ballistic response (fast jump, a bit slower retard). Bass and Treble controls are there but I wish there was a tone defeat as well. The position of the indicators is where I had to set them for more or less flat response. I do like the very fine detents on it, allowing you to more precisely adjust them at least.The included power supply is one of the largest I have seen but is rather light for its size:There are no remotes so the amp is for desktop use.  Class D implementation means the amp ran with no temperature rise even after all my tests. Protection circuit was excellent with automatic restarted after overload. The meter is useful in this regard as the amp shuts down when the meter is almost at the end of its range.AIYIMA A08 Pro MeasurementsI warmed up the unit for about 10 minutes with very stable response:Running our dashboard we see the usual good performance from AIYIMA amplifier range:Performance is above average despite the very low cost:Noise level falls in the same category of very good:As noted, there was a bit of a struggle to get flat response:And typical of their designs, there is load dependency.Crosstalk was above average for all amplifiers tested:Multitone performance was very good:This little box outputs good bit of power at 4 ohms:Even with 8 ohm load you have good bit of it:Transfer function (frequency vs power) is pretty good for class:ConclusionsAIYIMA has a good class D platform which they turn into various configurations with good success.  The A08 Pro is no exception.  You get unique looks and to some extent, functionality at still a very reasonable price.  With 100 watts per channel, both driven, you have very nice capability to drive any desktop speaker to its limit.

The cost is US $72 on Amazon including prime shipping.  And as of this shipping, it also included a 32 volt, 5 amp switching power supply.  Member also purchased and sent me a 48 volt/3 amp power supply which I also tested.The case is standard budget audio affair:The volume control feels cheep but does the job.  The back panel terminals were way too small for my binding posts:The DC input socket was quite stiff especially with the 48 volt power supply.  Tightness is not a bad thing as far as power transfer is concerned but this was a bit too stiff.  Here are the two power supplies:They both feel kind of cheap as they would be at these prices ($21 for the 48 volt one).  Personally I would not leave these plugged in permanently if I am not around.  The included power supply has a two-pronged AC cable that was not polarized.  Rotating it around made a small difference in mains leakage.AIYIMA A07 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohms:As you see in the FFT display, there is considerable amount of mains leakage at 60 Hz.  This tends to be a function of switching power supplies.  I played with grounding and improved it a lot in one channel but not in the other (not shown).  SINAD did not get impacted since it is bound by distortion harmonics.  As it is, performance is above average:Signal to noise ratio is not great due to the mains hum:Frequency response is well behaved, albeit with a slight droop at 20 kHz:Crosstalk is good and well above bargain basement desktop amps:Power is everything in a small amp so let's see how we do with 4 ohm load:As expected, with low impedance of 4 ohm we are current limited so the 5 amp stock power supply does better, turning in 77 watts.  Yes, the 300 watt rating is a fantasy but maybe it can do better with momentary peaks.  Alas, its aggressive protection circuit would shut it down and not let me test max and peak power.Naturally the higher voltage power supply does better with 8 ohm load where we become voltage limited:Sweeping power vs frequency and distortion shows a very well behaved class D amplifier:ConclusionsTraditionally these desktop amplifiers have produced really poor performance in the form of noise and distortion.  Not so anymore.  These TPA3255 based amps seem to have good bones in them, producing above average performance for peanuts.  Alas, you are saddled with two boxes and cheap and potentially non-safety compliant parts.  For desktop use, these are probably acceptable compromises.  I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A07 based on its performance.And with this, our last review of 2020 comes to an end!  Nice that it is ending on a happy note.  \",\n",

I only see one used one on ebay for $2100 which seems pretty expensive for an old amp.  Then again Linn is a high-end audio company so maybe it holds its value?EDIT: member feedback shows prices are really in US $600 range for used units.Despite the high channel count, the AV5125 is quite light and small:The back of the unit shows the unusual BFA (British Federation of Audio) speaker connectors:I had to rebuild my test harness to test it which I was none too happy about it.  It basically a banana plug but hollow on the inside.The trick to light weight is a switching power supply and a set of fans to cool the heatsinks:A pair of integrated IC amps are used for each channel.  The heatsink is beefy despite its reduced height.  In use the fans never came on.  I am suspecting some kind of rail switching is used to keep power consumption low.Overall, it is a \"cute\" design if you have to ask me.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with a simple 1 kHz tone driving the amplifier to 5 watts with 4 ohm load:SINAD which is a combined metric of noise and distortion is above average of 90+ amplifiers tested in all forms:Crosstalk is not very good:Frequency response is also not flat which is surprising:Dynamic range though is very good especially near full power:As noted though, when I ran the full power test momentarily, it started to scream quite loud.  How loud you say?  Well, my wife who was downstairs, listening to her podcast using headphones heard it and asked, \"are you making that beeping sound?\"  So there, we also have wife stories in our tests!Power test produced an unusual curve:As you see in the two reference amplifier tests in dashed lines, usually the graph points down due to noise contributions lowering as power goes up.  Not here.  The curve is flat which indicates constant distortion.  That is not a bad thing per se as we see really good performance until we exceed 20 watts and then we get ordinary response.Same repeats with 8 ohm load:Here, at low power we have very clean output.Back to 4 ohm load, we can see how much more power we get if we relax distortion to 1% and also measuring momentary power:The news is not good as is typical in amplifiers with switching power supplies which run regulated.  For good or bad, you get maximum power they have in all conditions.  Typical class AB amplifier has unregulated power supply rails which due to a capacitor bank, can produce more power in short duration.ConclusionsThis is an unusual design from a high-end company which went after \"home theater\" market back in the day when they could (prior to HDMI video standard putting them all out of this business).  The guts is not high-end but seems custom and well thought out.  Performance is reasonable to good.  I tend to like the originality, small size, light weight and proper engineering from this Scottish company.If you can find one on the cheap (well under $1000), then it is worth looking at the Linn AV5125.  I am going to recommend it more from emotional point of view, than logic.  ',\n",

I realize without it there is symmetry but the one or two times that you play something super loud and want to rush to shut it off, you will hate the fact that it will take some effort to reach under to power it down.  Another thing I didn't like is lack of acceleration on volume control.  You have to crank and crank it to turn it all the way up and down.The back panel shows the extra connectively over a standard analog amplifier:Very nice to see built-in DAC and Ethernet streaming.  What is not is the maximum supported sample rate of 96 kHz over USB.  This tells me they are using ancient and obsolete USB interface.  They say they did this for ease of design and to save money to put toward making the DAC itself better.  We will see about that.A simple plastic remote control is provided which is very similar to what we see from Chinese desktop manufacturers.  I tend to like it but it is unusual for such an expensive product to come with this kind of remote.  Usually they include some heavy but harder to use remote.Hegel H95 DAC MeasurementsThis being an amplifier, I immediately jumped to measuring that part of it first.  But then I had to backtrack when I noticed digital input performance was worse than analog.  Given the line out, I decided to measure the DAC using coax input.  For some reason, like a Hegel DAC I tested in the past, my ASIO4ALL interface would not see the USB input so I decided to test with Coax.  Here is our dashboard with volume control adjusted to produce the nominal 2 volts:I don't need to tell you that this is stunning high level of distortion, landing the H95 seven from the bottom list of some 350 DACs tested:When sweeping IMD distortion level, we can see part of the problem:This is something we see in Audio/Video receivers where they set the optimal gain to drive their amplifiers and not the 2 volts we are looking for.  Even then performance is not good, barely showing less noise than a $9 phone dongle!  We can measure the noise itself:This is horrid performance in any modern DAC.Back to distortion, we see that again in multitone test:Jitter performance is lackluster and what I would expect to see from random ebay DAC:To finish our suffering, here is poor linearity measurement:I think they may have unseated Schiit with their multibit DACs and poor linearity!Really, really bad showing.Hegel H95 Amplifier MeasurementsI first started with line in and adjusted the volume to get the nominal gain of 29 dB we use in integrated amplifier tests:Noise and distortion is just above average:I expected a lot better as the company's claim to fame is a comparator which supposedly detects distortion and sends an inverted signal to the amp to correct.  We see plenty of amplifiers without such circuit performing far better as you can see in above graph.  And of course we have products that use true feed forward technology such as Benchmark AHB2 currently occupying #1 spot in above graph.What's more, there are stability issues with that circuit (my guess).  Check out the warm up performance of this amplifier:I have never seen anything like this.  Variations are quite large (as much as 3 dB) with two very large spikes.  It never stabilized even though I let it warm up far longer than other amps to tune of 17 minutes.  Best case performance was actually when the amplifier was just powered on at 80.5 dB SIAND but then finishing at 79.5.  Switching to DAC input which one would hope would eliminate source of external noise made things worse, not better in that regard:You are losing 9 dB in SINAD due to much higher noise floor.  Why or why?  Again, AV receivers do this but I don't think I have measured this kind of degradation before when using digital input.So from here on I focused on analog input.  Here is our dynamic range:I like to see 96 dB at 5 watts but 91 is fine.  The max power performance doesn't improve much because this is not a very powerful amplifier.Crosstalk is also good:Frequency response is flat in audible band:Power output is just 63 watts into 4 ohm at the knee of the distortion curve:Allowing for more distortion and busting sharply increased available power:Power into 8 ohm is very low for this expensive of an amplifier:Checking for frequency dependency we see something limiting power before the amplifier naturally doing so:Hegel H95 Headphone AmplifierI usually don't bother testing headphone output on this type of amplifier as it is usually an afterthought.  But company talks about improving its output and noise level relative to prior products so I decided to test it some.  Here is our power curve into 300 ohm:I like to see 100 milliwatts of power here and 80 is close enough.  Switching to low impedance, we should get a lot more power but we do not:The guarantee reason is high output impedance and that is precisely what we have:I am amazed that in this day and age companies like Hegel are not aware of the fact that high impedance is bad for many headphones (changes their tonality) and that even budget headphone amps have impedance below 1 ohm.  77 ohm is just out of the question.ConclusionsLet's quickly agree that both the DAC and headphone amplifiers are junk.  They are better off leaving both out.  You can do better with hundreds of products that cost the same as the shipping or tax of the H95.  I watched one video where the youtuber said he preferred the sound of Hegel DAC to his Chord Mojo in some ways.  Wonder what he thinks now.The amplifier in H95 is good as far as noise and distortion but nothing to write home about.  Continuous power is very low for an amplifier costing $2000 however.This is just a bad attempt all around.  I can't see any reason to recommend Hegel H95.  Company needs to go back to the drawing board and design performant DACs and headphone amplifiers as a minimum.  On amplification, they are being left behind by proper feedforward designs and excellent class D with tons of power. \",\n",
       " ' SMSL DA-6 stereo desktop class D amplifier. It was sent to me by Shenzhen Audio and costs US $99.Ah, what a pleasure it was to unpack the DA-6 and see this nice thin packaging!  That niceness extends to the back, fixing one of my main complaints with compact amplifiers:Instead of stacking the binding posts on top of each other and thereby making it very difficult to put large binding posts, they are lined up horizontally.  This allowed me to connect my locking banana plugs into them with relative ease. Of course we are saddled with large laptop power supply running at 24 volts at nearly 7 amps.A remote control is provided to navigate through the menus to change bass/treble settings, volume control, etc.  Same can be done with the front panel and rotary control.A new Infineon class D amplifier IC is used here (didn\\'t see the model number).SMSL DA-6 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard:Relative sum of noise+distortion as expressed in SINAD lands the unit above average of some 350 amplifiers tested:I am assuming volume is controlled digitally given the perfect channel balanced.  Noise performance by itself is good for the class:Frequency response in EQ bypass mode still has a bit of low frequency roll off:Type of speaker you drive with this little amp could benefit from being pushed to play those low frequencies.  I thought I could fix that by boosting the bass setting one notch.  That tool though brings a sledgehammer to a nail being put on the wall to hang a picture:Oh, I forgot to mention that there is no load dependency which is something we often can\\'t find even in expensive class D amplifiers.  Not only that, the response is quite extended, going beyond 100 kHz!  I guess this is what they mean by \"high-resolution.\"There is no warm up requirement as the unit is stable out of the box, running quite cool:Multitone performance is again good for the class:Output power is more modest than I wanted to see but I guess you can\\'t have miracles:The response though seems dependent on level and keeps changing at micro level.   We see the same when we sweep with different frequencies:There is no headroom as expected:ConclusionsSMSL nails the industrial design and usability of a super compact desktop amplifier offered in attractive aluminum case.  A clear white display shows the volume control and inclusion of remote control lets you place it out of the way and still change its volume.  I don\\'t usually take price into account but in this class I must.  For $99 this is a lot of performance and good lucks/design.I am happy to recommend SMSL DA-6.',\n",
       " ' B&K Components AV30.2 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The AV30.2 is discontinued but is available on the used market for low price I am told.  I found one listing with asking price of $175 but not others.  The good news is that it uses the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE class-D amplifier module so the review should be relevant to other amplifiers in the market now.The B&K amp is targeted the CI (custom integration) market meaning it is usually installed in home and businesses by a dealer/installer as part of a larger system.  This amp for example could be hidden behind a flat panel TV powering a couple of speakers.  For this reason, the form-factor and connectivity follows the requirements for this market.Here is the front panel:The \"business end\" is on the back:As you can tell, there is fair amount of connectivity for home automation.  I did not investigate them but I imagine you can power the unit on and off remotely to say, synchronise with the TV being turned on/off.I liked the level control for both channels.  It is buttery smooth, putting many other volume controls to shame.  Using that, I was able to get perfect match between the two channels -- something you can\\'t hardly do with any modern amplifier anymore.The speaker connections use phoenix connectors which while super common in CI industry, was not the greatest choice here.  It was very easy to have the outputs short out if you left any copper sticking out the screw terminal.  In use, the connector did not make tight enough connection causing the performance of one channel to vary as much as 20 dB.  It was tight by feel but noise level would go up and down if I wiggled it.  For intended application probably did not matter.  If you want to use it for hifi home application, you may want to hard wire them if you run into the same issue I did.In use, the unit barely got warm to touch.  There is plenty of ventilation on top and bottom which helps in this regard as does the high efficiency of its switchmode power supply and class-d amplification module.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard at 5 watt into 4 ohm:I adjusted the output gain to 29 dB which means the controls were near max.  Performance may vary some at lower gain values.  I used 29 dB since it is probably the most common/THX recommended gain level.THD+N was 0.008%.  The 50ASX2SE spec from what I recall is less than half at 0.003%.  The discrepancy may be due to gain stage, the connector and just variation in units.  Overall, it is in the ballpark of what they advertise.   This translates into a SINAD above mid-point of all the amplifiers we have tested:Signal to noise ratio is just good enough for 16-bit audio playback at 98 dB at full power:On right is the same measurement but relative to max of 5 watts.  SNR does not drop much which is very good.Frequency response was dead flat in audible band and quite well-behaved with output filtering:Wide-band FFT spectrum shows ugliness that we typically see in class-d amps (at 5 watt here) and this is probably a more uglier than the normal picture:More of a visual scare though than audio.Most important measurement for an amplifier is power versus distortion and noise.  Let\\'s start with the common load of 4 ohm:As you see, one channel started to deviate as I said in the introduction.  But still, both of them are smooth and well-behaved giving us a power rating of 42 watts before hard clipping sets in.At 8 ohm, power level drops a lot as you would expect:Funny there though in how much lower noise and distortion the AV30.2 has compared to the NAD T758 AV Receiver (in dashed blue).  Would be a good replacement for it had it had more power.  If the modules higher in range have same performance, they may be a good application to power home theaters.That said, these modules have almost no headroom as their peak power is almost the same as average:This is because unlike class AB amplifiers, the power supply in these class-D amps is regulated and so other than some storage in output caps, can\\'t provide more juice for short periods. Another sign of good design is how the performance of the amplifier varies with level and frequency:Each line pair of the same color (solid and dashed) is at a different frequency.  An ideal amplifier would not care about frequency so all the graphs would land on top of each other.  Here, they vary some but much less than some other amplifiers I have measured.ConclusionsThe B&K AV30.2 provides competent performance across suite of measurements.  It runs cool, is efficient and small.  It easily outperforms mass market AVRs for example.  Alas, there is not a lot of power here so other than desktop speaker application, I would seek out something more powerful.Overall, I am going to put the B&K AV30.2 and by implication, the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE on my recommended list for mid-level performance amplification.',\n",
       " \" Niles SI-275 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The SI-275 is discontinued.  But since it is sold to the custom integration channel, they come up used and in working orders (companies pull out gear wholesale to redo homes).  I am told it can be picked up as low as US $100 to $150.  I see one on Amazon for US $230.  But there is a used one on ebay for $100.The look is fine:I like the tall feet on amplifiers to allow for more air flow.  A massive heatsink goes the full width of the unit with beefy transistors.  Love the fact that it has two trim resistors to balance the gain in both channels.  So annoying that these days balance controls are impossible to find yet amplifiers routinely have gain that is different in each channel (causing slightly shift in imaging).Back panel is simplicity in itself:In use, the SI-275 was solid as a rock.  Never shut down.  Never complained even when fully clipped.  The top of the unit barely got warm despite using traditional class AB amplification.  That large and heavy heatsink does a great job of spreading the heat load.  Nothing remotely like flimsy heatsinks in mass market stereo amplifiers or audio/video receivers.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our dashboard:Notice the perfectly matched channels.  SINAD is middling but is actually better because distortion is near -100 dB.  It is pulled down by power supply noise which due to being low frequency is not very audible.  Using what we have, performance is slightly above average:Noise performance follows the same standard:Frequency response is dead flat in audible band and extends way up:The wider the bandwidth, the more challenging the design (if not done well, the amp can oscillate).  Power into 4 ohm is healthy:Allowing for 1% THD+N, we get even more:8- Ohm power is:Response with bot loads is very controlled with no oddities.  Amplifier was stable as soon as powered on and performance did not change much after running for a few minutes (not shown).ConclusionsThe Niles SI-275 is made for abuses of custom integration channel which routinely stuffs amplifiers in places they don't belong (i.e. lack of circulation/cool air).  Its construction is well beyond today's mass market product.  Measured performance is just above average.  Combine these with prices as low as just $100 and you have a great deal.I am happy to recommend used Niles SI-275.  Bargain shoppers rejoice!  \",\n",
       " ' SMSL SA400 switching desktop power (speaker) amplifier.  It was sent to me by the company for testing and costs US $660.The SA400 is a powerful amplifier yet it comes in the same compact SMSL package and UI you would find in their desktop amp:Amplification is provided courtesy of ST Micro STa516BE.  The marketing material for SA400 shows a digital feedback but I don\\'t see that in the ST specs.  I am not clear if this is an addition by SMSL or it is part of ST amplifier chip that they don\\'t talk about.  Either way the input to the amplifier is digital so even though we have analog inputs, they need to be digitized to be used internally:A resonant LLC switching power supply provides the heft juice needed to drive this amplifier in a small package.  Bluetooth input is provided as well as a subwoofer output with low pass filter.  In addition, tone controls are included using a dedicated JRC chip.There is an informative temperature measurement you can turn on which I did as you see in the picture above.  With normal music listening (one channel) the unit stay pretty cool.  In testing however, the case got fairly warm and the display indicated 58 degrees C.  I suggest not stacking anything on top of SA400.One issue is a mechanical whine from an internal coil.  I can hear it even when nothing is playing from about 1 foot or so.  When testing at higher powers, this became much louder but when playing music, you won\\'t be able to hear it most likely.  SMSL SA400 MeasurementsThere are three gain settings but performance is very similar between them.  I adjusted high gain for 29 dB which is my standard (defaults to 30 dB):For the rest of my testing I used the adjusted high gain for better comparison to other integrated amps adjusted the same way.Distortion is around -90 dB but what pulls down SINAD is the rather high noise floor.  This causes the overall ranking to be just slightly above average:Indeed we can see the noise issue in our SNR measurements:State of the art amplifiers get 16 bits of dynamic range at 5 watts so we are two bits short here.  Even at full power you are adding noise to a 16 bit signal (you want your amp to be cleaner than the noise in the source).  This, and the fact that there is no bandwidth above 20 kHz nukes any idea of playing high-res content:Sure would have been nice to use an ADC that was running at 48 kHz, not 44 as it seems to be.  Use of the ADC is likely the reason the noise floor is higher than it would be otherwise.  We have seen this in AV receivers which likewise digitize their analog inputs (unless you put them in \"native\" mode).There is some very good news though. The feedback for the amplifier is taken post filtering which means it can compensate for the interaction between that filter and the load.  The above measurement shows actually two graphs: one at 8 ohm and the other, 4.  Both land on top of each other showing the amp doesn\\'t care which is great.  We only see this in the best class D amps like Hypex Ncore and Purifi.Crosstalk was very good but unpredictable:You can see the normal trend in the other two amps (dashed lines).Most important test for any amplifier is how much power we have and how much distortion and noise so let\\'s look at that at 4 ohms:This is a powerful little amp, producing nearly 500 watts of power especially if you allow some peaking:It complies with the spec which I think is 220 watts.  Power naturally drops at 8 ohm but still healthy:On our last test which is power versus distortion+noise at different frequencies.  The output was quite unique:I have not seen a power amplifier show this level of frequency independence.  Yes, having only 20 kHz bandwidth helps but still, even linear amplifiers don\\'t produce such dead straight and sameness the SA400 is producing.  This is quite excellent.Note that the the amp went into protection at both 20 kHz and 20 Hz in this sweep.  Alas there was no indication on the display. I had to power cycle the unit to get it to work again.SMSL SA400 Amplifier Listening TestsEven though I listen to every headphone amplifier, I only do so rarely for power amplifiers.  I decided to start doing listening tests with this amplifier which was a good thing.  I used an Infinity 253 speaker for my testing.  Despite driving only one channel, the SA400 drove the R253 with extreme authority and clarity.  Tons of detail and dynamics with little else to wish for.  Putting my ears next to the tweeter I could hear a slight hiss but a few inches away it would disappear.  The sound was so enjoyable I am still listening to it as I type this!ConclusionsSMSL brings us an interesting and unique power amplifier to us.  Love the load independence and small packaging plus tons of power.  Performance drops to average levels in some areas but nothing that appears to be faulty or poorly engineered.  I guess my one reservation is the cost.  I am not sure how much of this is temporary given the world order with component shortages, high shipping costs, etc. but to me, the better retail target would be $499.  The warranty is short at 1 year as well.  For DACs and such I am not worried about warranty much but for amps I do like to see longer warranty.Overall, I am going to put the SMSL SA400 on my recommended list.  It delivers tons of power with no weak points. ',\n",
       " \" Crown DCI 4 | 300N four channel DSP and networked professional amplifier. It was kindly purchased (used) and sent to me for testing and costs US $3,511.There is only a power on/off on the front. I wish there was a processing bypass as well. The full capability is visible on the back:I wouldn't be able to scratch the surfaces of all that this amplifier can do.  Suffice it to say you can do full processing (speaker and to some extent room EQ), environment/remote control, and transmission of digital audio over Ethernet type cabling.  Configuration is available using Audio Architect software.  Typical of these Pro applications, it takes a bit of effort to get used to its operation but after that, it seemed easy enough to use.A rather loud fan turns on during power on testing and then goes off.  Alas, during my testing it came back on.  Unless the amplifier is way away from your listening spot, better plan to put it in another room/dedicate closet.Connections are all through screw terminals. Not so bad for speakers but for balanced/unbalanced input, you are going to need to have bare wires (upper right phoenix terminals).  Not the end of the world but don't expect to buy and power on the same day if you don't have these bits.I was disappointed with the trim controls in the back.  They are very coarse and hard to adjust to an exact value.  And being on the rear makes it harder to manipulate.  For its intended application of professional installation is not a big deal but for one-off testing/use, is more work.I chose to test channels 3 & 4 as my standard setup is stereo.  During use, the amplifier case did not rise above ambient but again, the fan was running the whole time.Note: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and we move probably more Crown amplifier than any system integrated on the west coast.  So feel free to read bias into my subjective remarks.Crown 4|300N Amplifier MeasurementsUpon power on, output noise+distortion was quite stable which is nice:So on to our 1 kHz dashboard @ 5 watts into 4 ohm load:I must say, I expected much worse performance!  Distortion is below -100 dB and SINAD as a result, is dominated by noise.  As is, performance is a bit above average of many amplifiers tested to date:As noted, noise floor is somewhat high causing SNR at 5 watt to be below desirable level (90+ dB):Using default settings (which is how I conducted all of these tests), this is our frequency response:I was surprised to see the response not being flatter at 4 ohm.  Still, we are talking about less than 0.5 dB.  Importantly, there is slight change with load change to 8 ohm, indicating small amount of load dependency (which you could correct using DSP subsystem).Multitone yet again displays the low levels of distortion:Crosstalk is better than most amplifiers I measure:We have healthy amount of power into 4 ohm:And get even more when we allow 1% THD+N:Switching to 8 ohm load, we naturally get less but there is still good bit of power on tap:I was disappointed to see distortion rise though above 1 kHz as power increased:On the positive front, there is not much impact at 20 Hz so you can comfortably use the amp to power subs and such.Finally, turn on and off behavior is very good:Do notice the long time to turn on though (nearly 20 seconds).ConclusionsNice to see that as we go up in price performance of a pro amplifier improves as well.  No, it is not state of the art but this combination of four channels with sophisticated DSP and audio streaming is not easy to find in consumer domain.I am going to put Crown 4 | 300N amplifier on my recommended list.\",\n",
       " ' Behringer NX1000D power amplifier with DSP.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Can\\'t tell if it is discontinued or not but see it on sale at one place for $299.  Retail cost is $549.I am a fan of orange displays and NX1000D delivers on that (sorry my sample is not powered on):What I am not a fan of, pun intended, is the super loud fan that stays on all the time.  I walked away to go to the bathroom and was so surprised that I could hear it from very far distance in the house.  Unless you can put it in a sealed cabinet, I don\\'t see it being useful for hi-fi use.  Maybe you can modify it to quiet the fan or make it temperature sensitive. On the positive front, I really liked the look and feel of the control app that talks to it:The only thing I did not like about it is that it is not clear when some processing is on or off.  For example above, is the peak limiter on or off???The back panel shows SpeakOn connectors:And of course combo XLR/1/4 inch balanced inputs.  You can bridge the two channels although I did not test this configuration.  The \"1000\" designation is for total amount of power available.  As you will see, I was not able to come close to that in stereo use with 4 ohm load.Behringer NX1000D MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is average performance as amplifiers go:But it is good for pro amps.  SNR falls in the same category:Best in class amplifiers produce 96 dB at 5 watts and we are pretty shy of that.  So be mindful of background noise you may get out of your speakers if they are sensitive.Frequency response thankfully is load independent as the company advertises: Due to inclusion of DSP though, your bandwidth is severely cut to that of 44.1/48 kHz sampling.  So \"no high res sampling for you!\"Crosstalk was surprisingly good for the class:As I hinted, power delivery into 4 ohm is way under specifications:Even allowing for 1% THD and burst mode, we can\\'t get to the company spec:How did they get their 300 watt number?  Using car stereo \"standards?\"Power drops quite a bit into 8 ohm:Just 78 watts in a pro amplifier???  This is AVR class amount of power, not what you see in this class of product usually.Multi-tone test shows distortion increasing at both low and high-end of the spectrum:We see the same in our power testing versus frequency and distortion+noise:Notice how the 20 Hz distortion rises unusually what way.ConclusionsWe, the home users, look to pro products to get more wattage on the cheap.  Behringer unfortunately doesn\\'t give us that here.  Instead, it saddles the product with a loud, non-temperature sensitive fan which rules it out of many applications we may have for it.  So I don\\'t think it is a fit for what most of us want out of an amplifier even though there are some good qualities like load impedance independence, DSP, low cost, etc.As is, I can\\'t recommend the Behringer NX1000D.',\n",
       " ' five channel Classe Sigma AMP5.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and originally cost US $5,000.  I see one on ebay for $1,900 right now.This is one heavy amplifier for a class D architecture:At first I thought it had a linear power supply and its transformer was the reason behind the weight.  Alas, looking into other reviews and pictures inside, it uses a switching power supply.  So all the weight is from the enclosure and likely the very thick front plate.At first I was hoping that the glossy front where the logo is, is an LCD display with VU meters and such.  But there is not.  It is just for looks.  I must say as high-end products go, it is not that attractive to me relative to the high cost of the enclosure.  It has sharp corners which is not nice.The back shows quality selection of parts:I like the staggered speaker binding posts which makes it easier to plug things in.  XLR connections is what I like to see in an amp in this price range and we have them.  This amp was mated to their processor of the time which I suspect is discontinued longer than this amp.Amplifier MeasurementsI tested two channels (Ch1 and Ch2) using XLR input.  Here is our dashboard:Rather high second and third harmonics dominate causing the overall ranking to be middle of the road:Nice to see precise channel matching though.Frequency response showed unexpected results:Researching I found out there is an analog to digital converter which explains the sharp cut off.  I thought that meant DSP functions but there is none.  Instead, the digital signal is used as part of a protection circuit.  I can see that as a parallel path but not as the main path compromising the response this way.  This amp came out in 2015 so it is not like we didn\\'t have higher sample rates available then to at least go up to 48 kHz and get us flat audible response.Signal to noise ratio is middle of the road as well:Crosstalk is \"OK\" but should be better:Power vs distortion shows odd response at 4 ohm which gets worse at 8 ohm (see later):Very strange noise response at the start and the multiple sources of distortion take over, each causing their own non-linearities. On the positive front, we have healthy amount of power.  Not much more is available though in burst mode (typical of class D amps with their regulated power supplies):Here is power into 8 ohm:That step function is quite bizarre. Worst measurements came when bandwidth was increased to 45 kHz and frequency sweeps were used:No way this amplifier is so well behaved.  Instead I think there is high amplitude noise that is masking any distortion present (until clipping).  We can see that if we perform a wideband frequency analysis:We see sharp increase in noise right above audible band.  This is either caused by noise shaping in the ADC, the Amp or both and explains the previous graph.There is naturally switching spikes (near 400 kHz) but I am disappointed that its level is just 8 dB or so below our fundamental.  I like to see 20 dB or more attenuation. ConclusionsThis is a custom Class D design and switching power supply from Classe.  It clearly shows deficiencies of the design and creating a market for Hypex to come and show how class D is done.  Digitizing the input is not a good idea if there is no user benefit to it and there is none here.We could get depressed about the above or look at copious amount of power this amplifier produces while remaining cool (a bit above room temp in testing).  Since lack of power is the #1 reason amps sound bad, I am going to put enough emphasis on this as to not give it a failing grade.Overall, I am neutral on the Classe Amp5.  At current sale prices, you have about $400 per channel for 400+ watts of power.  It may be hard to match this with Hypex amp so you decide if it is worth it or not.',\n",
       " \" Schiit Vidar stereo amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Vidar costs US $699 and nicely comes with a five (5) year warranty.  With amplifiers being one of the most susceptible audio products to failure, long warranty is a real value.The Vidar sports the usual design style of Schiit which in this form factor is attractive:Despite its narrow width, the Vidar is quite heavy as it uses a linear power supply and class AB amplification topology.Back panel connectors are fine but I always miss balanced inputs in audio products:During power testing and such, the Vidar got fairly warm but not too hot and typical of the category.  It only shut down once when I ran a sweep causing it to clip at 20 kHz.I only tested the unit in stereo mode and not bridged.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone delivering 5 watts into 4 ohm load:We see the typical power supply noise spikes to the left and right of our tone.  SINAD (measure of noise and distortion) is dominated by second harmonic distortion though which rises to -80 dB or so in the worse channel.  As it is, performance is a few notches above average of some 85 amplifiers tested to date:Signal to noise ratio and crosstalk follow the same ranking:Frequency response is excellent though:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important aspect of an amplifier is amount of power it can deliver cleanly.  Let's start with 4 ohm load:We are getting 183 watts which is a bit shy of the 200 watt specification.  But that is at higher distortion.  If we allow that, we get there as well:Unlike class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, class AB amps like Vidar have much higher peak performance for short duration as you see above right.Using 8 ohm load we actually beat the company spec:Finally, the difficult test of power versus distortion versus frequency:Nice to see these lines without any strange curves and overlap.  This indicates there are no hidden dragons in the design of Vidar, just a standard degradation with frequency.ConclusionsSeems that Schiit set up to design a straightforward Class AB amplifier with lots of powers and no design flaws.  In that regard, it succeeds.  You have an attractive amplifier with long warranty and lots of power into 4 ohm load.  At US $699, it is priced well.Overall, I am happy to recommend the Schiit Vidar.\",\n",
       " ' Parasound 2125 V.2 power amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $899.The 2125 has an understated look with just a few touches to keep it from looking boring. The only controls in front are for which set of speakers it drives.  There is more however in the back:For those of you wanting to use it with a sub, it has selectable high pass filter of 20 or 40 Hz.  Trigger is supported as well as bridging.Parasound 2125 V.2 MeasurementsI had a heck of a time getting stable ratings in the dashboard with channel 1 mostly going nuts on its own. I thought this was a grounding problem so tried many things.  There was hardly a difference.  It was not until the power measurements that I realized something is going on the amp in the 5 to 20 watt range.  Anyway, here is our dashboard when both channels were behaving:Measured noise+distortion lands the 2125 above average ranking:Noise performance is not great at 5 watts but naturally improves at full power:Multitone reflect the average distortion rating:Frequency response is very good:I was however surprised that gain dropped when I activated the high-pass filters.As noted, my first power sweep had instability in mid power.  I thought this was instrumentation error so I filtered the heck out of it and got these:On reflection though this was amplifier instability as we can see when I sweep the frequency:There is a frequency dependent hump in distortion which is very strange.  It is likely due to some kind of voltage rail switching.There is a lot of power available though in a cool running case:ConclusionsThis kind of performance would usually garner my recommendation for the 2125. On reflection though, I am worried about increased distortion in the \"sweet\" area of power band -- 5 to 20 watts.  Company needs to work on mitigating this issue.  So for now, I won\\'t be recommending the Parasound 2125 even though it checks many boxes from value to functionaltiy.',\n",
       " \" Class D Audio (the company) CDA-250C Power (speaker) Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The CDA-250C costs USD $495 from the company direct which barely sneaks it into affordable class.There is not a whole lot to look at on the face of the unit:As you see, the unit is made in USA.  I suspect the case is generic Chinese though given the DIY look and feel it has.The power button is oddly in the right side of the unit.The back panel sports very large speaker jacks which is nice:Unfortunately there are no balanced inputs even though the holes seem to be made for them.Another miss is lack of any safety or regulatory certification.In testing, the CDA-250C ran completely cool.  I could not feel slightest rise in temperature of the case whether I touched the top, left or right, which is really good.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard at 5 watts of output:I was pleased to see the unit working well enough to allow me to measure it down to DC and hence the DC offset.  Many recent switching amplifiers make my analyzer go crazy if I DC couple of it.SINAD (signal over distortion and noise) is rather low and seems to be driven by high noise floor than distortion products (which are below 100 dB).Signal to noise ratio is disappointing:We can't even clear the CD's 96 dB at either 5 watt.  We barely get there with 200 watts of output (which is already pretty distorted).The news gets pretty ugly when I measured THD+N versus frequency at six different power levels:We have multiple problems here.  At both low and high end of the frequency spectrum we have rising noise and or distortion.  The higher the power, the worse they get.At low power outputs (around 1 to 2 watts), low frequency noise seems to escalate which may be due to power supply noise.To top it all, two channel are wildly different than each other.  One seems to be a lot more susceptible to noise than the other.Let's look at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone with wide bandwidth and see if we can figure this out:I should have run this without my external filter but let's run with it anyway.  We see our usual spikes in hundreds of kilohertz due to switching frequencies.  But we also see a rise in noise around 50 kHz or so.  The previous test uses 90 kHz bandwidth so this peak will impact the measurements.  Note again the channel mismatch.Let's rerun the previous test, this time by limiting the bandwidth to 22.4 kHz.  Note that this means that we can't capture anything past second harmonic for the high frequencies (hence the reason the levels artificially drop there):The graph becomes somewhat cleaner especially at low output level (in red).  But otherwise, the signature issues with distortion/noise remain.Let's run our typical power versus distortion test.  Note that 1 kHz tone is used for this test so doesn't incorporate the issues we see above:We have good bit of power reaching 178 watts into 4 ohm before clipping sets in. FYI, I have refined this test to give us more resolution near max power so it is a bit unfair to previous products I tested.  Still, this is quite a bit more power than the two reference amps in the graph.When I get a chance later, I will test the output impedance versus frequency.  And a frequency response test which I just realized I forgot to run too.  ConclusionsGetting nearly 200 watts/channel into 4 ohm for a US made power amplifier for $500 is not bad.  Outside of that, you have to close your eyes to many flaws.  These noise and distortion issues way dwarf anything upstream.  As such, I don't see the Class D Audio CDA-250C in any kind of high fidelity system.  Our search will continue for something with Hypex NC400 performance but at half the price.Needless to say, I can't recommend the CDA-250C but you can judge it for yourself and your application based on above data and decide.\",\n",
       " ' 3e Audio SY-DAP2002 stereo desktop DSP amplifier with Bluetooth.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  I will also do a teardown and test with upgraded op-amps.  I went to look up the price just now and it says no longer available!  I think it was US 116.The enclosure is heftier than is typical for the class:A cute set of white LEDs rotate around the volume control when first turned on and then indicate volume level.   An unusual twist for this class of amplifier is inclusion of mains power supply:No figure-8 power cord was included however so I have to supply my own.  As you see, there is a little fan to help with cooling but it never came on during my testing.  I had the top open and touching the heatsinks showed that they were pretty cool which explains the fan staying off.Note that while there is a DSP subsystem, I did not test it.  It is based on \"Sigma\" ADAU1701 platform which I already reviewed. Amplification is provided using the ST Micro TPA3255 chip.SY-DAP2002 MeasurementsI started my testing using stock configuration:Distortion is quite low at -95 dB however SINAD is way worse at just 72 dB indicating noise as the limiting factor (SINAD is sum of noise+distortion relative to signal).  Don\\'t be confused by the -100 dB noise floor in FFT.  That is after some 35 dB of \"FFT gain.\"  The owner had warned me about the noise and indeed had gone ahead and purchased the recommended upgrade opamps, the LM 4562.  I took the top off and swapped both and performance indeed improved:Noise still dominates though so performance continues to be average:You can see the effect of noise in SNR tests:Here is the comparison of noise with no input signal with or without the op-amp upgrade:Frequency response is limited based on digitization and load dependency:Crosstalk was generally good but somewhat variable:Multitone test shows how low the distortion is, alas with high noise floor:Healthy amount of power is available before shut down:Because of aggressive protection circuit, I could not get to 1% THD to measure max or peak power.Good bit of power is available at 8 ohm indicating that the 4 ohm performance above is current limited:Transfer function is quite good for a switching amplifier:SY-DAP2002 TeardownOverall construction seems reasonably clean:Top row is the switching power supply which naturally has high-voltage rectified mains in it.  As such, I would have liked to see a routed slot in addition to existing isolation that exists on the PCB.  That would reduce the chances of arcing from high voltage side to the low voltage amplifier.Capacitors are lower grade as usual but at least all the ones I looked at are higher grade 105 degree C.  The heatsink is quite beefy for its size and seemed to do its job keeping the TPA3255 chip amp cool in my testing.  I am not sure the fan will do any good since it likely pushes air in but there are no vents to push air out.  High static pressure then reduces its effectiveness although likely it is better than nothing (if noise is not a problem).I did not like the Bluetooth antenna lead travelling from the front of the board to the mains side.  The noise from switching power supply may reduce Bluetooth range and at any rate, it is not a safe place for it should the lead come off and touch the high-voltage areas of the power supply.  The RCA cables could have been moved a bit up (in the picture) and made room available for that in the low voltage section.I see no regulatory and safety certifications which is not good in mains powered gear.Overall, this is not nearly as bad as it could be.  ConclusionsGetting a DSP platform and top-flight chip amp and power supply in a small box takes good bit of effort.  Overall, this is not a bad platform but compromises are there with performance dropping below what the chip amp can do.  Personally I use DSP upstream so have no use for it in the amp in this configuration so the performance hit (if due to that) is not good in my book.  But you can decide otherwise.I could have recommended the amp but seeing how I had to upgrade the op-amp to get good performance, I am going to pass.',\n",
       " \" Rotel RB-1070 stereo power amplifier. It was released in early 2000. Can't find the cost then but I see it used for around $400 to $500.I have always found Rotels to be most attractively designed power amplifiers.  One look at that front panel and you immediately think of muscle and beauty in design.  Alas, the extruded aluminum in front which gives it that look, is cosmetic.  There are two others internally which do the job of cooling this classic AB design.  In use the heastsinks got pretty warm to touch to give it some air to breath.Not much news in the back other than nice inclusion of trigger input/output:Rotel RB-1070 MeasurementsThe unit warmed up nicely without its performance changing much:So let's see what our dashboard of 1 kHz tone does into 4 ohm load:The amp is about 2 dB more sensitive than usual which likely accentuates the power supply noise a bit.  I was able to reduce 60 Hz hum in one channel but not simultaneously in the other.  That is exceeded however by the power supply noise at 120 Hz and multiples.  SINAD is likely dominated by distortion to the tune of -80 dB.  This lands the RB-1070 slightly above average of all amplifiers tested:Despite the power supply noise, dynamic range is very good:Frequency response is excellent and spec compliant:Crosstalk is good:Multitone shows no frequency dependence which is nice:There is ample power available into 4 ohm:The response is quite odd in that it doesn't slope down.  Don't know if that is intentional, accidental or due to power supply caps aging, letting in more ripple as power goes up.Regardless, lots of power is available:Company only specs the power into 8 ohm at 130 watts.  It certainly delivers that:Putting aside noise floor which is rather high, the units transfer function is one of the best I have ever seen:Sadly there is a significant power on pop:ConclusionsAs one of my favorite (looking) brands, I was very anxious to measure a Rotel amp, hoping it would not let me down.  Fortunately it did not.  No, the SINAD doesn't break new ground but the rest of the measurements are very good with plenty of power available.  It is a great choice for people wanting good amount of power in an attractive package with competent performance.I am going to recommend (used) Rotel RB-1070.\",\n",
       " \" Outlaw Model 5000 five channel home theater amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  Despite the number of channels and power of each, the Model 5000 costs only US $649 though shipping adds fair bit to it.The shipping is expensive because this is thing is super heavy.  It is at the limit of what I can reasonably carry upstairs to my lab (50 pounds):My back nearly got killed just rotating the darn thing in my photo booth:Sadly, as you see, there are no balanced XLR inputs.  You are given heavy binding posts though which is nice.Left and right channels are far apart which is the right away to do it as they, and the center channel get beat the most.  And is most logical layout in my book.In use the Model 5000 never complained, shut down or anything of the sort.  The heatsinks are below the top cover so you can't exactly feel their temps.  I would imagine it would shut down though if it got too hot.Not much else to talk about so let's get into the measurements.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Nice to see the gain at 29 dB which is the only recommended standard in the wild (from THX).There is fair amount of mains hum and power supply noise.  I improved them a bit with messing with grounding but this is the nature of the beast when a linear power supply is used.Distortion is dominated by second harmonic which combined with noise and hum gives us a middle or the road SINAD:Speaking of noise, there is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and near full power:I like to see 96 dB or better at 5 watts to clear the dynamic range of the CD but we don't get there.  At full power though, we meet that target and a bit more in the good channel.Frequency response is basically flat in the audible band:Testing with my simulated speaker model did not change the response hardly at all:Crosstalk was good as it should be in modular amplifiers like this with independent amps:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important deal with any amplifier is its power versus distortion and noise so let's start with 8 ohm load:Nice to see the Outlaw 5000 completely outclass our NAD AVR both in much lower noise, distortion and available power.  The picture is almost the same with 4 ohm load although distortion rises:These are two channel tests.  Adding two more 4 ohm loads power drops a bit naturally:That is over 800 watts delivered into the load which is great.Back to two channel power, here is what we get with short bust (simulating what you may get in music) and more steady state -- both at 1% THD+N:The toughest test I run is power versus frequency while trying to achieve 0.1% THD+N. The amp has to deliver its output while being stressed the entire 3 to 4 minutes the test runs.  Many AVRs quit.  Not so with Outlaw 5000:As you see, it not only passed the 2 channel test, but also 4 channel.  A quick statistical analysis of my high-res music library shows highest peaks at 40 Hz and that is where the cursor is.  We are getting 252 watts at that frequency with two channels and 207 watts with four channels.  Yes, it is lower than 1 kHz peak I use in other graphs but still a lot of power.ConclusionsDespite its bargain price, the Outlaw Model 5000 is solidly built and delivers tons of power without complaining.  It provides a clear setup over the built-in amplifiers in home theater AVRs.  No, it doesn't deliver state of the art distortion and noise.  For that, you will have to pay a lot more money.  For what it is, it is very good and I am happy to recommend the Outlaw Model 5000.\",\n",
       " ' Douk Audio H7 stereo class D desktop amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs US $144.Right away we see differentiation in the form of the nice looking VU meter.  Not only that there is a control to set it sensitivity which is a must in my view. The backlight is nice and bright and goes well with that yellow/orange ring.  The case is machined aluminum so feels nice and heavy for its size.  The switches and controls are surprisingly robust and impart a feeling of quality.  In other words, this is in entirely different class compared to typical budget desktop amplifiers.  Surprised continue to the back side:Yes, we have real, full size XLR inputs!  Of course there is also RCA input but they also added a set of RCA outs.  I am assuming that is to connect subs and out but there is no internal filtering.The heart of the unit is TI\\'s TPA3255 single chip stereo class D amplifier with very lofty specs:Wide input range is provided. Included power supply is manageable with 32 volts output with 5 amps of current.  If you are going to drive higher impedance speakers and you want to go louder, you may want to up that to 48 volts.One negative which actually follows some \"high-end\" gear is dual volume controls.  Yes, to increase or lower the volume, you have to crank both of them. I would have wanted to see a single volume control with a balance knob.  As is, you can set them once and use an upstream DAC with its volume control (and remote).  That is how I tested it by setting the gain to 29 dB and treating it as a power amplifier.  You can see the position of the volume controls in the picture for that gain setting.Douk Audio H7 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm load using XLR input:The SINAD of the good channel at 82 dB is above average for all amplifiers tested.  But for some reason the other channel (in blue) is distorting more which drags the average down some:Zooming in:Noise performance is quite good for class although short of the TI specs:As is typical of budget class D amplifiers, the frequency response varies with what load (speaker) you connect to it in treble region:This means you may hear brighter or softer sound depending on exact impedance of the speaker. Best to use EQ and tailor that to taste.Distortion is kept very low at 5 watts:The less good channel lost 1 bit here (not shown).  So still quite good and more than enough for the application.Crosstalk is very good for any amplifier let alone a budget one:Let\\'s see how it does in power department starting with 4 ohm load:This is good bit of power and only gets better if we allow 1% THD:I ran this three times as I could not believe it breaking into 3 digit department!  200 watts out of this little box?  Granted, the test is short term but still, that is quite healthy.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally get less power:Note that most speakers are around 4 ohm in bass frequencies where most of the volume is so don\\'t go optimizing for this unless you know you have an 8 ohm speaker in that region.EDIT: forgot originally to post the power vs frequency:There is only a dB or so impact due to warm up (one channel getting better and the other, worse) so I would just turn it on and use:Finally, there is likely to be some audible pop on both turn on and off:Kind of strange to see the blue channel die out that way.  This may have something to do with that channel also underperforming in the dashboard.I had no luck trying to test the H7 with my powercube reactive loadbox. It caused some kind of interference that would keep it from switching loads.  Will need to spend more time investigating what is going on.ConclusionsThe Douk H7 breaks new ground in multiple areas from nicely done VU meter, nice looking case, and very good measured performance.  The only issue is if you can live with dual volume controls.  I am happy to see such differentiation in this highly price sensitive and crowded market.I am going to recommend the Douk Audio H7 amplifier.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of a DIY combination of ICEpower 200AC and 200ASC in a Ghent audio case.  It was kindly supplied by a local member.  Total part cost is US $310.The case work is fine:I like the hefty power switch which also acts as protection circuit indicator.  Speaking of that, it is of nice variety that self-resets and doesn't require manual power cycling.The back panel sports far better connectors than you could get in any mass market amplifier:And of course balanced inputs.The internal amplification for one channel is provided by the ICEPower 200ASC which has an integrated switchmode power supply.  This in turn feeds power to the amplifier-only 200AC module.  Nice and clever!ICEpower 200AC MeasurementsLet's run our usual dashboard into 4 ohm:Having been spoiled by high performance class D amplifiers, this is somewhat of a letdown.  Distortion is dominated by third harmonic at around -78 dB which sets SINAD to the same rating.  Result is average performance among all amplifiers measured to date:Signal to noise ratio is good though:Frequency response is as well:Power into 4 ohm though show early rise of distortion:Disappointing to see performance be worse than some of the worst AVRs we have measured at the limit.  Same is true at 8 ohm:Even when we allow distortion to rise to 1%, we still don't get the rated 200 watt power:The power supply is the limiting factor likely.Sweeping the power range at different frequencies gives us very complex response:The lines going backward are caused by the amplifier going into temporary shutdown.  This is occurring at just 40 or so watts at 20 kHz!  Fortunately there is not much music power there but still, from engineering point of view, I like to see far cleaner and stable response.  In some cases SINAD is rising to below 50 dB at just 2 watts!ConclusionsAs usual, we have high efficiency and compact packaging of class D amplification here.  What we don't have is performance that matches or beats good class D amplifiers.  Of course the cost is much lower as well (compared to higher performance class D amps).  So you have a trade off to make.  I am too much of a perfectionist to want to recommend this unit but depending on what you are using it for, it may be fine.\",\n",
       " ' Emotiva BasX series A-500 five channel home theater amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The A-500 costs US $529 which seems reasonable given the functionality and ratings.I can\\'t say that I find the A-500 attractive but is not ugly either:Here is the connectivity which sadly does not include balanced XLR connections:This is a Class AB amplifier with a rather larger toroidal transformer.  It is not overly heavy though which my back appreciated.The heatsinks end well below the top of the case so it was hard to judge how warm it got by touching the case.  A quick test with IR temperature sensor showed the heatsinks running around 50 degrees C.In use the A-500 never complained, shut down or go into thermal protection.  This is nice benefit over the delicate amplifiers in AVRs which if you look at them wrong, they go into protection/shut down.  Clearly this is much more robust solution.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts output:I was surprised by two things: large channel disparity with respect to distortion (SINAD) and very high mains hum at 60 Hz.  No amount of playing with grounding fixed the latter which tells me the 60 Hz is probably induced from the transformer into the amplifier section.  The former, channel distortion parity varied with which channel you used.  Channels 1, 2 and 4 were very close and good.  Channels 3 and 5 lagged way behind.  The \"good channels\" had their SINAD actually dominated by that mains hum and power supply noise, not distortion (red channel).   The situation was reversed for the \"bad channels.\"Averaging all the channels we get a middle of the road score:Signal to noise ratio reflected the above issue with a-weighting resulting in substantial improvement of SNR:Our threshold of heaving in low frequencies is quite high so this is not as big of a problem audibly as it is in measurements.Frequency response was very good, almost ruler flat in audible band and going beyond 100 kHz at -3 dB:Crosstalk between channels 1 and 4 were rather disappointing:It is closer to a $29 amplifier than our state of the art Benchmark AHB2.The meat of the review is power measurements versus distortion.  So let\\'s get into that at 8 ohms:Nice to see the massive improvement relative to a higher end AVR (NAD T758) but as soon as distortion takes over, that advantage is sadly lost.  We do get a few more watts though than our AVR.Here is the same measurement with 4 ohm load:Let\\'s sweep from 20 kHz to 20 Hz and see how much power we get with THD+N set to 0.1% (barely or not audible distortion):We see a small drop in power at the extremes which is good.Some of you have been demanding that I work harder and measure performance with more than two channels.  So here you go:I could not get the amplifier to distort less than 0.1% with 4 channels regardless of output level. So I stepped that up to 0.2% to get the third graph.  I could have been watching a movie instead of running these extra tests so I hope you are happy!ConclusionsThe Emotiva BasX A-500 seems to be a decent shot at building a 5 channel amplifier for a very decent price.  Yes, it is a bit of a gamble how good each channel is, and how audible that mains hum can become.  Other than that, it is a definite step up very amplifiers in AVRs.Overall I can recommend the A-500 if you are on a budget and have a bad back stopping you from lifting something heavier.',\n",
       " 'This is a review and abbreviated measurements of the Linn Majik DS-1 integrated streamer and amplification.  It is on kind loan from a member.  It has been discontinued but back in 2010 (?) when it was announced it was US $4,200.  I see a recent ebay sale for a bit over $1,000.The Linn is an attractive unit:The interesting bits are in the back:You have full suite of analog and digital inputs although given the age, USB input is lacking.  Roon remote is built into the networking which is very nice for an older device.  And of course you have full amplification in there for a single box solution.Streamer DAC Stereo MeasurementsSince there is line out, let\\'s use the Toslink input into its DAC and measure what comes out before the power amplifier:By today\\'s standard, this is definitely subpar with sum of distortion and noise relative to signal not close enough to beat the CD format:I tested streaming with Roon player and performance was identical which is good.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started testing the power amplifier by using the Toslink optical input first:We see sum total SINAD of 78 dB.  This obviously is NOT limited by the DAC as it produced 20 dB better performance.  Indeed switching to analog input we see that confirmed:As its, the DS-1 lies smack in the middle of rankings of all the amplifiers we have tested regardless of price (nearly 120):I quickly ran a frequency response test using analog input and was quite surprised that it was not flat:Thinking it may be digitized, I switched to digital input with both 44.1 kHz and 96 kHz sampling:We see the same curve.  So unless there is some kind of EQ I don\\'t know about, it is sad to see such roll off.Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm:This is very little power for all but secondary use.  It naturally drops lower with 8 ohm load:And these are not \"good watts\" either given how early distortion takes over and flattens the curve and then swings up at clipping.ConclusionsIn 2010 this kind of functionality would have been advanced.  But today there are a range of streaming solutions with amps that retail in hundreds of dollars with much more power.  It is disappointing to see an engineering focused company like Linn target so low in power and noise and distortion.Anyway, even at $1000 I can\\'t recommend the Linn Majik DS-1.

The A800 costs US $299 including free shipping from multiple sites.The member who loaned it me has done a youtube video of it which you can see by clicking on this link.Behringer has been in this game for a long time and it shows from high level of optimization of weight, size and robustness of the A800:The unit is quite shallow relative to its width. Standard gain controls are provided which go up to 30 dB (for balanced input).  Nice set of LEDs show the output level including clipping indicators.  All amplifiers should come with such displays (with switch to turn them off).  I could do without the notches in the volume control though as they are fake (they are fully analog) and made exact setting harder (it would creep into the notch).  Not a big deal though.Back panel shows nice set of connectivity:For my testing I focused on XLR input only and standard speaker banana connectors.The amp hardly radiates any heat and has no fan.  Given the pro application of these amps, I expect them to be robust and reliable.During measurements, the A800 provides high level of predictability and assuredness that I sometimes miss when testing switching amplifiers.  It only shut down once after fair bit of experimentation at full power.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a gain of 29 dB to deliver 5 watts into 4 ohm load:This performance is very close to the Behringer A500 which I reviewed before.   That amp though, generated much worse SINAD because of its non-switching power supply:Its distortion products are capped to -80 dB which is what we see in A800.   Eliminating those power supply components sharply improves SINAD which is relative to sum of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is \"OK:\"Don\\'t use it on sensitive speakers you may hear some hiss (although turning down the gain may help some).32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows early rise in distortion with frequency:Crosstalk is reasonable:Dual, 19+20 kHz tone shows very high level of intermodulation distortion as we saw in multitone test:Fortunately your music doesn\\'t have such high amplitude tones and threshold of hearing is high that I don\\'t think this is nearly as much of a problem for the ear as it is for the eye.Frequency Response MeasurementsThe necessary low pass filter is causing some peaking at 20 kHz to the tune of 0.5 dB:The above is with a resistive load.  I have been asked frequently how the amp performs with a real speaker.  Stereophile uses a simulated load of a 2-way speaker that was given to them by NHT.  I built a similar load based on schematic from Doug Self:Here is the impedance of my load versus frequency:My response is more damped in low frequency than what Doug Self and Stereophile show.  I will investigate this further but for now, it is close enough.  Here is the phase response:And Stereophile graph of the two:Using my simulated load this is what I get with A800 amplifier:As you see, there is hardly any difference.  Looking at stereophile graphs, they use highly zoomed version to show differences.  This is what happens when I do the same:So a bit of ringing becomes apparent but it is so small as to not be of any consequence.  Heaven knows your speakers are not anywhere close to this level of variation.I will test some of the other amplifiers I have with this load and see if it causes more variation.  As it is, resistive load is the same as complex one.Note that neither my load, nor stereophile\\'s are high power ones.  So I cannot plot full power graphs and such.  Above measurements were at 5 watts.Amplifier Power MeasurementsGoing back to our resistive load, we get this output with 4 ohms:The show starts well with A800 being much quieter than our premium brand NAD AVR.  But then distortion kicks in and we don\\'t do as well.  We get however tons of power nearly a quarter of a kilowatt.  Similar story holds for 8 ohm load:Still, that is a lot of power at 8 ohm leaving our AVR way back in the dust.Using 1% threshold for THD+N, we get more power naturally than my graphs above indicate:Left hand is short-term burst power, right side is long term.Thermal StabilityPerformance improved just a bit after 10 minutes of warm up at 5 watts:So you don\\'t have to leave it on for good performance.ConclusionsThe Behringer A800 does what pro amps try to do: provide solid, middle-of-the-road distortion and noise with tons of power in quiet and light package for little money.  The design is stable and better than the A500.  As such, I can recommend the A800 as an everyday amplifier.',\n",
       " \" Wyred4Sound mINT integrated stereo amplifier and DAC.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,499 from the company.  I see reviews dating back to 2013 so the box has been around for a while.The design goes with the rest of Wyred4Sound gear although in person looks less refined than I expect in this price range:The back panel shows some very good functionality such as triggers and home theater pass through:The overall package is small and convenient from that point of view.  It ran reasonably cool which was also nice.As I took this picture, I realized USB only goes up to 96 kHz which is the old school USB interfaces of the time.  Fortunately it is asynchronous which was novel at the time and could have been worse in the form of synchronous USB.Wyred4Sound mINT MeasurementsWhen I first powered on the unit, the measurements were low so to make sure it was not my setup, I took the time to route all cables separately tightened all the connections and performance seemingly improved.  But this morning I got up and thought maybe the box was warming up and changes had nothing to do with the wires so ran my standard warm-up test:Looks like my guess was correct.  The amp did not stabilize even after 7 minutes of running with load on.  I waited at least that long before I took the measurements you see below so represents the warmer side of things.  With amplifiers with both digital and analog inputs, I always have to determine which input is best which depends on topology of the amp.  So let's do that here, first using Aux In analog input:I tried hard to suppress that mains noise at 60 Hz but every change made it worse.  I then switched to USB input:Man, this is bad.  It should be a walk in the park to have  DAC that keeps up with an amp that has a SINAD of 77 dB but here we are, with one of the worst performances I have seen with digital input.  So let's continue with analog input for the rest of the tests starting with our SINAD rating:So below average and disappointing.  Even more disappointing is the high noise floor:Crosstalk is fine:Frequency response unfortunately shows variability which means the class D amp used doesn't use a feedback loop outside of its filter to remove that dependency:Assuming you have good high frequency sensitivity, this amplifier will sound different with different speakers.We see that distortion sets in early and rises a lot:Here is our peak and max power at 1% THD:Sweeping different frequencies shows reasonable response for a class D but not in general:ConclusionsI very much like the functionality of the mINT with cute small size.  Performance though is subpart and much better can be done than what we have here with discrete parts which may cost even less than this combo.So I can't recommend the Wyred4Sound mINT.  But if you are fond of the functionality, I am not going to chase you out of the room .\",\n",
       " \" Jeff Rowland 535 stereo (bridgeable) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  I believe it costs US $5,900.If you are not familiar with Jeff Rowland, it is a high-end audio company, known for their gorgeous machining of their cases that imparts a 3-D look.  You can see that coming through the protective film which I chose to leave on:The unit is incredibly heavy for its small size.  The back panel shows the most unusual binding posts I have seen:Those big knobs rotate to tighten bar on two spade terminals.  The feel incredibly nice.  Alas, they don't mate with banana leads and I had to screw around to connect mine.The amplifier is said to be balanced throughout including input transformer which is made with wire from Cardas (!).  Company only states that a switching power supply is used but says nothing about the rest of the functionality.  From my testing, it seems to be class D which would explain why the amp stayed completely cool to touch under testing as if it was never on!  The massive chunk of chassis aluminum is likely responsible for great thermal performance.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz dashboard at 5 watts into 4 ohm:Ah, this is disappointing.  Distortion peaks to -80 dB which sets SINAD at an average number of 77:This is way below stated of the art in switching amplifier design.  Company specs are similar by the way so this is representative performance as designed.Where specs don't match is in signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk curve usually gets worse with frequency (due to increased effect of stray capacitance) but here it is rather flat:Frequency response is very good with no indication of interaction with the load:Another shortfall from the spec is in power department:Letting distortion peak up to 1% still doesn't give us what the spec says:I don't know how they get to 500 watts unless it is at even higher distortion levels.As a way of comparison, let's see how the power curve looks like relative to noise and distortion of Hypex based NC400:We have slightly more power although the NC400 I tested had a shared power supply.  That aside, there is no comparison in noise and distortion department.  The 535 way underperforms the Hypex.Finally, here is an unfiltered output of the amplifier at 5 watts:We clearly see the switching waveform.  Attenuation is better than 30 dB which is more than a number of other amps I have tested so that is good.ConclusionsThe Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier has beautiful fit and finish.  And is solidly engineered to run cool and I am sure reliable as a result.  It produces good bit of power which should be able to drive many speakers to desired loudness.  Alas, it reinvents the wheel and makes it less round.  Any amplifier based on Hypex modules will have as much or more power with far less noise and distortion and lower cost.Bottom line, I can't recommend the Jeff Rowland 535 due to its high cost and average noise and distortion.\",\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio TB10D stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and is only sale for US $70 on Amazon including shipping.We have the typical compact desktop aluminum case. Controls feel nice for the class.  Tone controls are not centered however for flat response (you can see in the picture what I set them to). Typical of these budget amplifiers, power is provided externally through a switching supply:Binding posts are spaced out a bit more which made it easier for me to plug in my large cables.This is a class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 single chip amplifier.Fosi Audio TB10D MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watts measurement of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:Dominant distortion is third harmonic which essentially sets SINAD to same level. This is slightly below average but considering the price of this amp, it is reasonable:Kind of interesting that the $5,900 Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier lands almost next to it!Signal to noise ratio is modest but again, good for the class:Crosstalk holds its own against much more expensive amplifiers:Frequency response is variable due to bass and treble control and load dependency:The load dependency is the norm in this class.  Hopefully some amp comes along and with no cost penalty takes care of that (by incorporating the output filter into the feedback loop).Distortion rises with frequency which we can see in multitone test:Power is everything in amplifiers so let\\'s see how much we have:This is quite healthy for such a small and low cost amplifier!  It gets even better if we allow 1% distortion:We are talking essentially 200 watts coming out of this little box!  Cost per watt is just 35 cents.  Amazing.Even with 8 ohm load we get good amount of juice:Amplifier \"transfer function\" (output vs input) is very good for class D although it does show rise in distortion as noted earlier:Of note, you still have 66 watts of power at 20 Hz.  Many budget amps drop to 20 or so watts which can be problem as bass is what requires power.ConclusionsMaybe one day this will change for for now, in under $100 range you can\\'t expect perfection in performance of a stereo amplifier.  What you do want to see is delivering healthy amount of power with close to our average of all of our amplifiers tested to date.  On that front, the Fosi Audio TB10D delivers. If you need an amplifier for secondary use (bedroom, workshop, etc.), the TB10D is a very good candidate for no more money than one or two dinners!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio TB10D amplifier.',\n",
       " ' SMSL A100 A100 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member. I can\\'t find it on sale anywhere but seems to have cost US 100.I like the simply but rather elegant/symmetrical design.  Same for thoughtful rear connections:Almost every manufacturer puts both speaker outputs together making it so hard to plug in the banana plugs. Here they are spaced apart which essentially solved that problem. Inclusion of an AC power supply is unheard of in this price class and nicely declutters your desk.Oddly the USB input is type A.  At first I thought this was for external storage but manual talks about using this with a computer.  I didn\\'t have a type A to type A cable so didn\\'t test this and stuck with Aux analog input.The heart of the unit is Infineon MA12070 class D amplifier.SMSL A100 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Distortion is actually better than 90 dB but there is rising level of noise and high order spikes which drag it down to 76 dB.  This puts is slightly below average:Edit:Request was made to measure using USB input.  I had to use a special breakout box to interface to the unit given its type A connector.  Here is the dashboard:As you see, performance is degrade fair bit.  My breakout may be causing some clock jitter but then again, if async USB is implemented, this should not be the case.Noise performance is \"OK:\"Multitone shows the same problem at high frequencies:I expected frequency response to have load dependency but thankfully, it did not:What ringing it has is above audible band which is good.Crosstalk is very good, beating some home amplifiers:Power output is naturally modest:Sensitivity to high frequency input becomes very clear as we do power sweeps:Unit didn\\'t need any warm up.ConclusionsThe message here is a sum of good and not so good.  I really like the frequency response for a class D amplifier and inclusion of AC power supply.  Distortion on the other hand rises with frequency.  I like to see perfection but we don\\'t have such an example below $350 currently.  Overall I would say not a bad attempt.  Strange that despite having become available late last year, it is discontinued already.  Maybe there are part shortages.I am going to recommend the SMSL A100 as a budget amplifier.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of BasX A-100 Class AB amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me for testing.  The A-100 costs US $229 from the company direct.I must stay, this is one gorgeous looking and nicely feeling amplifier:This is a deep cabinet ending in the terminals in the back:As you see it has trigger capability.  Not a fan of the figure 8 AC mains cable as I have very few of them.  Best to not lose it.There is a fan on top but I did not hear it come on.  The unit does get quite warm though so allow ample cooling/space above it.Emotiva BasX A-100 MeasurementsAnother member had contacted me asking me if I could test if the unit was distorted while cold.  I had stopped testing for this since the warm up effect has been so minimal.  Not so here:You see what I am seeing?  12 dB improvement in distortion after 5 minutes???  I am assuming bias is not optimal while cold but why? Temperature compensation is quite cheap and has been part of design of amplifiers forever.Anyway, here is our usual dashboard:Not happy about the channel gain difference.  As it is, performance is a bit below average:I like to see a dynamic range at 5 watt approaching 96 dB and we are fair bit short of that:Frequency response is flat enough:Crosstalk is pretty good for a budget amp:Here is the multitone:Power versus distortion+noise is good:If we allow 1% THD, we get the power spec from the company:Distortion characteristic has a simple relationship with frequency and that is it:ConclusionI really like the packaging and price of this amplifier.  While overall performance is good, having to wait 6 minutes before it stabilizes is just not acceptable.  I would be tempted to buy this and mod it to make it temperature stable.As is, I can't recommend the Emotiva BasX A-100 amplifier.\",\n",
       " ' Argon SA1 integrated amplifier with phono input and Bluetooth. It is on kind from a European member and costs €369.I have a soft spot for white audio electronics and the SA1 goes right after that!  Quite elegant. What I didn\\'t like is the lack of indication on the file LEDs which indicate inputs. The volume control is digital (also controlled via an included remote). Pushing it selects the input.  The LEDs also blink for other reasons I did not try to figure out. Here is the  back panel:It was odd to see just a type A USB that is indicated as USB power.  There should be proper USB input in this day and age. There is pre-out but in my testing, I found that the volume control did not adjust it when using digital input but did with phono. Maybe this was operator error, I don\\'t know as only a single half-sheet of instructions is provided with the unit.The unit as shipped is for 50 Hz/250 volt so I used my lab AC generator to power it.  Specifications say \"40 watts\" of power so thought my 300 VA lab supply is enough.  As it turns out, it was not.  See the measurement section.FYI, there is a very clos cousin of this unit from NAD in the form of AMP1. I could not find either for sale in US.  The AMP1 lacks Bluetooth I believe but has Chromecast built in (?).  It is not clear who built this unit.  Likely it is an OEM for both.Argon SA1 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit Toslink and measured from the pre-out.  The output was severely clipped.  So I brought the input level down -12 dB to our nominal 2 volts and no clipping:This lands the unit in the middle of our \"fair\" category:I like to see a SINAD of over 100 dB for this class product and we are good few dBs short here. Here is the response sweep of digital input levels:Our dynamic range is just \"OK:\"At this point, the picture of the DAC performance is clear so I thought I cut to the chase and measure the amplifier.Argon SA1 Amplifier MeasurementsWith amplifiers that have both analog input and digital, I start by testing both to see which is more transparent and run with that.  Here is analog input:This is not a happy picture with rising low frequency noise and distortion that is just below -80 dB.  Let\\'s try Toslink input:Ah, that is much better.  The combination of noise and distortion is well above average now:So let\\'s continue with Toslink input starting with our SNR:We are a few dBs short of my 96 dB requirement for 5 watts but 88 dB is not so bad. I expected crosstalk to be better given the digital input:Frequency response shows some load dependency in this Class D amplifier but better than many with this problem:Let\\'s see how much power we have starting with 4 ohm load:Multitone performance is good:I could not get to clipping range as my AC lab supply would shut down.  So likely there is more power to be had as you can see in this dynamic test:I did have enough juice to run the 8 ohm test:In both cases the SA1 beats the ARCAM AVR10 in noise which is good.Argon SA1 Phono MeasurementsThere was tremendous amount of mains interference in the phono stage dashboard.  I am not going to show that as it may be due to use of my lab supply.  But here is the all important RIAA equalization:It seems to be a little heavy handed in upper bass with a rumble filter built-in.  Not bad but not perfect either.ConclusionsI really like the way the SA1 looks.  But looks can\\'t get me over \"checklist\" DAC performance of around 16 bits.  The analog input on the amp doesn\\'t perform well but digital does.  Overall I have mixed feelings on the unit so not going to pass judgement one way or the other.  I let you all do that by answering the poll.',\n",
       " ' Crown XLS 1502 \"PA\" Power Amplifier.  It is on a kind loan from a member who bought it new and drop shipped it to me.  It retails for USD $349 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.  At that price, it seems like an incredible value.I have to say, while the unit looks industrial/military, it does not at all feel cheap.  As expected it comes in 19 inch rack mount configuration but very shallow:Not only do you get a high power amplifier with front graphical display and such, but also a built-in DSP.  It is not a fancy subsystem but allows you to dial in crossovers and such which is very handy in live sound.   At may company (Madrona Digital) we use a ton of Crown amps not for hifi applications but for music distribution in the home.  The built-in DSPs come in handy for limiting the frequency range, max output, etc..Unlike home units, the XLS 1502 has a built-in fan with tons of holes for ventilation as you see.  Fortunately it is temperature controlled and barely came on during my nearly 50 watt soak time.  And when it came on, it was very quiet.Here are the guts of the unit (click on the image for larger size):Man, is this clean!  Look at the beefy mains chokes to keep noise at bay.  The power supply is integrated on the same board as the power amplifier so you can\\'t swap one to fix the unit although at these prices, getting a new unit is more economical anyway.  The fan is placed not only in front of the heatsinks for the power transistors but also the output filter inductors which is nice as far as keeping them cool too.I noticed that the output stage is depopulated.  Seems then that the step up model just has a few more parts in it and that is that:There are tons of connectors in the back which I let you read about elsewhere.  Overall, this is jaw droppingly nice unit and unbelievable at the price that is being charged.I did a lot of searching and was surprised that there were no measurements of these units.  A lot of empty reviews, yes.  But no measurements.  So you get to have an exclusive set of data in this review!    So let\\'s get into that.MeasurementsI started by cooking the unit for a while at 48 watts with kind permission from its owner:Unlike some other amps, bringing the unit up to temp ever so slightly worsens performance.  There are also some interesting thermal effects from time to time represented by the spikes.  Anyone who thinks they can predict what thousands of components do as they warm up should get into predicting the weather on tuesday next week, 10 years from now!  Anyway, let\\'s look at our dashboard at 5 watts of output:Sorry I did not set the reference in the FFT.  But the news is there in the SINAD (signal over distortion and noise) of just 75 dB.  We have seen worse but also much, much better.  Gain is about 30 dB by the way.Signal to noise ratio is decent but again, nothing high-end about it:Let\\'s look at power versus distortion+noise:So we see that the Crown XLS 1502 easily outperforms the no-name Chinese class D amp we recently tested (IRAUD350).  It has a well behaved response with sloping down curve and then onset of clipping.  Power was around 336 watts @ 0.008% distortion.  I say \"around\" as there are not enough points in these measurements to find the exact onset of clipping.  The number is therefore a bit understated.  Crown specs the unit at 525 watts though at 4 ohm and we are not going to get there without a lot of distortion.The hypex Hyped DIY Nc400 amplifier far outperforms the XLS 1502.  It has far lower noise and distortion although not as much power before clipping.  It costs nearly four times as much though.I thought I do a comparison against the Behringer A500.  The A500 feels a lot more cheaply made but is also priced at $199:We see that the Crown XLS 1502 is better in every regard with lower noise and much more usable power before clipping.I thought the continuous power would be a walk in the part for the XLS 1502 but did present a surprise:The red \"thermal\" light came on the front panel but instead of shutting down, the power was reduced a bit.  \"The show must go on\" seems to be the rule here and nice to see instead of full shutdown we saw with Hypex Nc400.   As you see, I let the unit keep going and it went to 8+ minute maintaining that status.Frequency response was surprising but easily explainable:We have a \"brickwall\" style filter which indicates our analog input is digitized first through an ADC running at 48 kHz sampling, processed through DSP (or not), and then converted back to analog before amplification. Both the ADC and DAC therefore sharply limit the bandwidth to 48 kHz.  I was surprised to see some roll off at 20 Hz too.Wideband FFT (without AES filter) as usual shows a lot of activity in higher frequencies:The first peak is very nicely truncated at a little less than 100 kHz to pass emissions standards (by 60 dB).  Crown class I devices interleave the output stages which would explain the energy spread over four quadrants at multiples of that ~100 kHz pulses.  Since the XLS 1502 has passed emissions standards I would not worry too much about them.ConclusionsIt is hard to fathom that a properly engineered and produced mainstream brand amplifier with so much power can be sold for so little money.  This is a robust but bargain amplifier designed for heavy punishment in live sound.  Can it be used for hi-fi use?  Sure but it will severely limit both the resolution and potentially bandwidth of upstream sources.  Its best use would be as a subwoofer amplifier.  If you need an all in one unit, Hypex NC400/NC500 designs are so far my choice among amplifiers tested.',\n",
       " ' Outlaw Model 7140, seven (7) channel home theater power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 7140 seems to have come out a few years ago and is shown as discontinued.  At the time it was out, the cost was a reasonable US $1,100.  The new replacement series, 7000X looks just like this so not sure what they have changed.The 7140 is a beast of an amplifier, nearly breaking my back carrying it up to my lab:The design is highly modular with a massive toroidal transformer powering 7 independent amplifiers, each with their own power supply on board.  The heatsinks are rather beefy with plenty of distance between them and top of the unit.  The feet are also quite tall allowing better ventilation from bottom to top.The back panel shows the inclusion of XLR inputs which I appreciate:The inclusion of a grounding terminal was interesting.   It did no good in my testing with XLR inputs as it should not.During use, the 7140 was quite stable, never complaining, shutting down or anything as Audio/Video Receivers (AVRs) tend to do.  Clearly then this is a more robust solution than internal amps in those units.Power Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard view of 5 watts into 4 ohm load using a 1 kHz tone:I was surprised to see such high mains hum at 60 Hz.  A prior review of another unit with just RCAs complained about the same thing and recommended a ground terminal on the unit which they have added.  But as I mentioned, it made no difference.  I have to think this is magnetically coupled into the amplifiers.Fortunately or unfortunately the distortion spike from 2nd harmonic is bit higher still so didn\\'t impact measured SINAD (combination of noise and distortion relative to our main tone).  As it is, the 7140 lands below the average for all the amplifiers we have reviewed so far:Frequency response is flat enough:32-tone signal to resemble \"music\" shows the typical rise of distortion with frequency:And rather high noise floor which could be caused by that power supply hum.Here are the noise figures for 5 watt and full power:We are not clearly more than 14 bits or so at 5 watts so not very quiet.Here is our power versus distortion and noise at 8 ohm:We see the elevated noise and distortion relative to our reference amplifier.  Power produced is right on the money at 146 watts.Here is the same at 4 ohm:The above tests are at 1 kHz.  Here is what happens when we sweep the frequencies, aiming to measure power at 1% THD+NQuite a drop in power with both loads when we get down to 20 Hz.  The power supply capacitors are likely too small to keep up with the slow rate of change at low frequencies.We see a similar view when we look at sweeps at different frequencies:Finally, some people like to see intermodulation distortion of 19 + 20 kHz tones so here it is at max power:ConclusionsThe Outlaw Model 7140 has a very sturdy build.  It produces good power per specifications provided from manufacturer (at least in two channels).  The down side is too much ground/mains leakage and distortion+noise that is slightly below average.  Paying more (a lot more actually) will get you sharp reduction of such problems.For typical home theater duty, the 7140 should do the job fine.  It just isn\\'t something to get excited about from pure performance point of view.',\n",
       " \" Sound Town ST-UPDM4C four (4) channel professional amplifier. It was purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me. It costs US $540.As you see, there is a bit of style to this amp with the front panel.  This is a straight amplifier with no DSP:The fans came on immediately and made moderate amount of noise (much quieter/lower pitched than many small fans like this).  As you see, input is XLR and output is speakon connectors.I was very pleased to see Audio Precision analyzer graphs in the manual.  They were quite tiny and hard to read but made me hope that the design was verified through such.Sound Town ST-UPDM4C MeasurementsThe tests you see are all performed using Channels 1 & 2 on one side.  Let's start with our dashboard:SINAD is below average of all amplifiers tested by 4 dB but for a Pro amplifier, it is not bad:But there is more going on here.  There is broad set of noise between 2 and 4 kHz.  I shut off the signal feed to it and was very surprised to find this noise component:Seems like some square wave with harmonics buzzing around internally that is bleeding into the amplifier.  Not good.That noise limited the signal to noise ratio:It also showed up in multitone test:Notice how the ends of the spectrum has reduced levels which indicates non-flat frequency response:Not only do we have (speaker) load impedance dependency but we are missing the lows as well below 40 Hz or so.  As such, you can't use this amplifier for subwoofer duty.Amplifier is rated at huge wattage so I was shocked to see so little output with 4 ohm load:I am used to seeing power exaggeration in pro amplifier specs but this is in entirely different class.Strangely, I got identical amount of power into 8 ohm load:Is there some kind of limiter in the unit?  There must be.  See what happens when I change frequencies:See how the curve goes up but then starts to go backward below 1 kHz?  That is electronic limiter in action.  Finally crosstalk was very poor:ConclusionI have hardly seen any audio device show issues in every test I run but here we are.  I don't understand what is going on here.  How can they have analyzed the performance using AP yet have so many issues left on the table?  Did they design change post those measurements?  This is the frequency response from the manual:It shows flat response to 20 Hz.  Notice the date is 2003.  Is it really that old of a design?Anyway, I can't recommend the Sound Town ST-UPDM4C. \",\n",
       " ' PS Audio Sprout100 integrated DAC, headphone and power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Sprout100 is an upgrade over the original Sprout and costs USD $599.I remember the first time I saw the Sprout at an audio show.  I thought it was utterly cute!  It is small and handsome little package with a ton of functionality:As you see, in addition to functions I mentioned, it even has Bluetooth included.  And moving magnet turntable input.  It is a dream product for a frustrated marketing guy in a high-end audio company like PS Audio, wanting mass market product that appeals to the \"younger audience.\" The volume control is a rotary encoder with a built-in switch that powers the unit on and off.  If you hold the button down, the LED color changes from purple to white, indicating bass boost is on.  The rotary encoder is poorly programmed to have linear and slow response, making it very, very slow to change volume.  To go from low to high volume you may have to turn it seven or eight times!  We live in a digital age with music that is fast to access and comes at all levels.  Having the ability to quickly change volume is important.Input selection is old school mechanical selector.  I like the clear labels.The backside shows how much is crammed in there:I did not test sub out but it has sensor that automatically activates that output (and rolls off the mains?).In addition to USB input, we also have toslink optical which is nice in case of ground loops.The nicest bit is included power supply in such a small package.  Kudos for managing to fit that in there and reduce clutter.There is protection circuit for both power amplifier and headphone.  During testing I found it to frequently activate which simply turns off the unit.  It caused a lot of head scratching until I discovered the latter action.It is also I think underdesigned from cooling perspective.  When I started my DAC testing, I had the dummy load connected to the unit as well.  After a few minutes of testing I noticed the signal went away.  Then I realized per above it had shut down.  Went to touch the power button and it was hot as heck.  As was the rest of the enclosure which was super hot.  Even the top \"wood\" panel was hot to touch.   I would not rely on the 100 watt rating into 4 ohm to be a continuous rating for any length of time.The Sprout100 is rated at 100 watts into 4 ohm and according to PS Audio uses ICEPower modules.I should tell you that I hate testing multi-function devices like this.   Every subsystem takes as much time as reviewing another product with just that functionality.  In the interest of getting the review done, I did not bother to test the Vinyl input.  I also did not touch the sub out or toslink.DAC MeasurementsThe inclusion of line out allows us to test the DAC subsystem independently so let\\'s start with our dashboard there:The output was variable so I adjusted it to 2 volt.  Per my review notes above, the power amplifier was on and was whaling away into the dummy load at the same time.PS Audio rates Sprout100 as having less than 0.01% THD+N distortion from line out.  We are beating that although that is such a low bar.  Equivalent rating in SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) puts the Sprout100 in our bottom quarter of DACs reviewed:Not a good place to be although probably fits the performance target they created for themselves for \"lifestyle product\" like this.Back to our THD+N rating, we can separate the components of distortion and noise and get this ratio:They are both contributing to the final THD+N but the noise is a bit more dominant.  Likely in this small enclosure the could not get enough isolation for the DAC subsystem to reduce noise levels.The high noise level makes the jitter graph \"pretty\" with almost no spikes visible but that is because the noise floor is so elevated:Best in class DACs put that noise floor down to the bottom of the graph.Same noise problem manifests itself hugely in linearity test:That smooth, exponential rise indicates random noise polluting the voltage reading at each level.  Noise-free performance then stops around 80 dB or 13 bits -- quit a bit shy of 16 bit performance of CD.  In this day and age, I like any DAC to at least do justice to CD format, bringing fully transparency to 96 dB.Intermodulation test shows similar higher noise floor but also pretty early rising of distortion levels:Similar story for THD+N versus frequency:Dynamic range of the DAC is as spec\\'d:Speaker Amplifier MeasurementsNote: all amplifier testing except when noted, is with an AUX-0040 Audio Precision filter in place to reduce high frequency components given the fact that this is a switching amplifier design.As usual, for amplifiers I test with 5 watt output.  The trick is to know what to use for input level and volume control.  With digital input that was easy as I set the level to 0 dBFS.  But then I thought we want to know the performance of the amp alone so we better test with analog input and here is what I got:With digital input I could get over 80 dB by the way.  But no combination of input and volume level could get us there with analog input.  In some sense then the amplifier is good enough for the performance of the DAC.Frequency response showed different response in each channel:I swapped my loads and the curve did not change, indicating that the variation is due to the amplifier (filter) design, not differences in my loads.  Clearly the channel in blue is resonating around 50 kHz, causing that large boost of nearly 20 dB!  What you get with your speaker load and its wiring is unknown.  The red channel is more behaved.  We saw the same discrepancy between channels in the SINAD in the dashboard.Poking our noise into the design using high-bandwidth spectrum (FFT) analysis, we see this:Note that this is a raw test with the external filter removed.  We clearly see the switching frequency around 600 kHz peaking up to almost -20 dB.  You can have your own AM station if you like.    We have an early rise in noise before 100 kHz which is due to some kind of noise shaping.  There are a lot of other spikes which one could examine to see what is going on but I am too lazy to do so.  Regardless, these amplifiers are not pretty to look at as far as performance above audible band.  It is the price you pay for having 100 watt/channel amplifier squeezed into a little box.Speaking of power, let\\'s measure that into 4 ohm load:We get 82 watts with both channels driven which is shy of the 100 watt specification.  Noise and distortion is lower than Topping TP60 ($200) amplifier.  And there is more power.Signal to noise ratio is \"OK\":Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s jump right in with power versus distortion and noise at 300 ohms:We have competent level of power but much more noise and distortion than our reference Topping DX3 Pro ($220 when not on sale).  I like to see at least 100 milliwatts here and the Sprout100 delivers.Here is the picture at 33 ohm:We have 420 milliwatts of power until the Sprout100 shuts down causing the graph to shoot back to the left.  In other words, the unit is distortionless until it shuts down.Output impedance is a bit high at 5.7 ohms:Headphone Listening TestI started my testing with Sennheiser HD-650.  There was enough power there for a very good experience.  I could not detect any onset of distortion.Switching to Hifiman HE-400i, I got a bit more power and again, clarity and power until the end.Dedicated headphone amplifiers will produce more power but there was enough here with either headphone to give a bit of tingling to my ear lobes during bass so I was happy.  I could not get the Sprout100 to shut down with the HE-400i so in practice this may not be a serious problem.ConclusionThe reviews I read prior to testing the Sprout100 all point to how great it is that a \"high-end\" company like PS Audio has produced such a mass market product.  And that this association must be translating into excellent sound.  Our objective measurements show that this is not the case.  Performance of such subsystem as the DAC and headphone amplifier is nothing to write home about. Subjective aspects though are good: lots of power from the headphone amp and to some extent, from the power amplifier.The miss from usability is the super slow to change volume control.  In many cases I could move it a notch and nothing would happen to the output in my analyzer let alone the ears.So where do we land?  From objective performance I can\\'t say that the Sprout100 lives up to the promise of the brand.  From full functionality point of view at $599 it seems to be there though although I have yet to test many products in this category.  For this reason, I am going to withhold giving or holding back a recommendation.  Let the data guide you in that regard.',\n",
       " \" Crown XLS 1002 rack mounted pro amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  The 1002 costs US $339 including Prime shipping from Amazon.Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman and hence Crown products.  We use fair bit of Crown amps in custom installs usually to power in-ceiling speakers and such.  Member wanted to buy it through us but the margin on it was no more than a cup of coffee (relative to online sites) so I suggested he buy it elsewhere which he did.Not sure what to say about the look other than it is made to have some style while being rugged:The LCD with bluish backlight reminds me of displays on electronics back in 1980s.  I guess at this price they had to cut every penny.I was relieved to see binding posts besides speakon connectors:Now don't laugh but I could not figure out how to pull out the safety plugs they put in the darn binding posts!  There is no way to grab then and I did not want to put a mark on them by using a sharp tool.  The manual says only European units have it but clearly that is not correct.  Anyway, I resorted to using the SpeakOn connectors for my testing.  For input I focused on XLR inputs.I set the gain to max to get the nominal 29 dB I have standardized on for testing amplifiers.There is a fan in the back and some inside.  But none came on that I could hear above the sound of my PC during testing.  Nothing shut down even when the amp was pushed into clipping.  Some kind of limiter would kick in after short period to keep the power level at max.  Temperature of the case didn't even rise above room temp.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsPerformance was stable during a 5 minute warm up time so I ran with them:Strange to see higher order harmonics dominating the distortion profile (FFT to the right).  Ratio of noise+distortion to signal as expressed in SINAD is what I expect decent pro amps to produce:Slightly below the average of all amps tested.Signal to noise ratio is in the same range:Crosstalk is reasonable:Frequency response test shows that everything is digitized due to inclusion of DSP functionality in this amp:Power into 4 ohm is healthy as is the case with most pro amps:I was disappointed to see one channel be much worse than the other though.Letting distortion go higher we get higher power output:The burst/peak power is not higher because of the limiter I mentioned in the intro.Using 8 ohm load gives a more behaved response than 4:This indicates the one channel is starving for current than the other (likely longer path to the power supply).I was unhappy to see distortion shoot up at higher frequencies:Fortunately in practice there is not much energy up there so you will be operating in low wattage area where distortion is quite a bit lower.Finally, I removed my AES filter to get the spectrum:Switching frequency is around 380 kHz and decently attenuated.ConclusionsCompetent pro amplifiers target for good enough noise and distortion.  The Crown XLS 1002 falls in that category so if you were expecting to have anything better for so little money and so much power, you would be disappointed.  But otherwise the amp does what it targets to do.I am going to put the Crown XLS1002 on my recommended list for non-critical applications or for driving subwoofers and such.\",\n",
       " ' Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 Stereo Class D power amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $799 (recent price increase).The GaN 5 comes in a compact enclosure with plenty of ventilation at the cost of decent looks:Beside the sole power button and blue indicator, there are two red LEDs that turn on when you power the unit on and then go off.  Strangely, when the amplifier goes into protection, they do not light up and getting the unit working again requires a power cycle.  I like to see protection circuits that self recover when the extreme condition goes away.The back panel shows binding posts that are too close together for easy fitment of my large banana speaker cables.  But I like the inclusion of balanced XLR inputs:As you see, there are also jumpers to change the gain setting although the range is not very large (26, 28 and 32).  Most of my testing was with medium gain which is as shipped.I had trouble getting the amplifier to function initially.  It would simply not output anything.  I played with grounding as I have seen some very low end amps cause AP to not be able to capture their output due to high level of noise (despite my use of AES-17 filter).  This didn\\'t work at first so I switched inputs to RCA.  That did not work either.  After some fiddling and switching back to balanced input, the amp all of a sudden started to work.  Not sure how much of this is interaction with Audio Precision or design issue.  Either way, it is an exception to the rule of 95% of amplifiers I have measured.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses the new Gallium Nitride transistors (GaN) which has some advantages over classic Mosfet transistors.  All else being equal, it can produce higher efficiency and better performance at expense of higher cost.Mini GaN 5 MeasurementsAs noted, I started my testing in medium gain which produced near nominal 29 dB which is my standard for amplifiers.  XLR input was used per introduction:Well, this is disappointing.  Distortion is fairly high causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion+noise to be worse than a number of budget desktop amplifiers:Noise performance by itself is not good either:I had trouble getting the amplifier to go to full power for the right graph.  It would shut down at just 0.7 volt input. Strangely, later on it accepted higher levels of input.  I think the impulse nature of this measurement was causing it trouble.  So maybe it can produce higher SNR at higher power but still, none of this is competitive.On the other hand, crosstalk was very good:Multitone performance was also reasonable:What is not reasonable is high dependence on speaker load when it comes to frequency response:This is just not proper.  Clearly the output filter is interacting with the load.Power measurements were quite puzzling:Notice the pull back due to some protection kicking in, likely the power supply rather than the amplifier.  I could not remotely get the power rating they specify using medium gain.  I thought maybe low gain does better but then the pull back occurred at even low power (blue and green)!  Beside lack of power, distortion is also quite high for this price class and category.  We are talking about poor Audio/Video Receiver amplifier performance!Switching to 8 ohm tamed the output a bit but power shortfall is still significant:This being the second amplifier I have recently tested with such power shortfall, I started to doubt my instrumentation.  So I pulled out my Purifi reference design and measured it.  It tracked the dashed line in the above graph from a year ago 100%.  Someone had posted this from their website:600 watts per channel??? Into 8 ohm?  This is the spec from the manual:How on earth did they measure 600 watts when the spec is 200 watts?  Strangely, that graph is nowhere to be found on their site.  There is some talk about a larger amplifier of which is a shrunk version?  Maybe that is the one that produced higher power but why does it say \"mini\" in the title of above graph?FYI, this amplifier has the green board which I understand to be the newer design.  Maybe the older red one had more power.  Hard to say.Anyway, I tried to run my max and burst power:In Burst mode, the amplifier would keep going into pull back and so I could not compute anything for that.  Likewise the THD+N vs frequency and power could not be run.  As the frequencies got lower and lower, the point where the amp would pull back would also shrink to lower and lower wattages.   What I could get did not show great transfer function.ConclusionsWhile I leave the door ever so slightly ajar to some interaction with Audio Precision, the measurements seem to indicate an amplifier that has both design issues and inability to meet specifications.  The fact that the company took away the only measurement graph makes it suspect that maybe they had have modified the design and selling something different than what they originally intended.  As it is, it is a waste of GaN technology as it brings nothing to the party but high expense.I can\\'t recommend the Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 amplifier.',\n",
       " ' \"upgraded\" TPA3221 chip based AIYIMA A05 integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $80 from Amazon including Prime shipping.For a budget amplifier, the controls feel nice:As you see, tone controls are provided.  Alas, there is no detent or switch for flat response.  If you center them, you actually get too much bass.  I had to adjust them using iterative measurements to settings you see in the picture above for flat response (see measurements later in this review).A giant external power supply providing 32 volts is included which dwarfs the size of the unit itself:I dislike these little speaker terminals but they are very common in this price class.  They are too close to each other to connect beefy locking banana connectors I use for testing.Bluetooth is provided which I did not test.In use, the unit never even got warm so efficiency must be quite high.  Or else, the heat is not transmitted to the case.AIYIMA A05 MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:SINAD is dominated by distortion and ranks below average of all the amplifiers tested to date:Still, for this price and category, I think this is pretty good.Signal to noise ratio becomes good at full power:Crosstalk is decent as well:Here is our frequency response with my adjustments of the tone control:As you see we get a typical peaking of the response when I change impedance to 8 ohm.  This is due to the filter in the class D amplifier interacting with the load.  Fortunately you have tone controls here so you can compensate for it.Multitone shows best performance in mid frequencies which is a good thing compared to the alternative:Let\\'s see how much power the A05 can produce into 4 ohm load:This is much more than I expected.  We get decent amount of power even with 8 ohm:Above is with 1 kHz.  Let\\'s see how it does when we vary that:Not pretty at either high frequencies or very low.  As noted, mid frequencies do well which is good as that is where we are most sensitive.  ConclusionsGetting decent amount of power and low distortion and noise is hard in ultra low price category but the AIYIMA A05 gets there.  So I decided to grade it on a curve and give it my recommendation.',\n",
       " ' Monoprice 150 watt \"605030\" rack mountable \"pro\" stereo amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing.  The 605030 costs just US $119 from Amazon including Prime shipping which is remarkably low.From a distance the unit looks like any other pro, R1U amplifier:It looks rather cheap an unattractive to me but hard to imagine any pro amp getting some kind of design award for their looks.Two gain controls are provided in the front which I appreciated.  For testing I aspire for gain of 29 dB and I almost got there at max level as shown.  That is how I tested the unit.  There overload indicators which was niceWhat I did not like one bit was the rather loud fan which runs continuously.  Monoprice, please take another $5 from me and make the fan temperature dependent please!Seeing balanced input in any amplifier at $115 price range is incredible but that is what we have here:Output is provided in the form of SpeakOn and mono 1/4 inch sockets.  Neither is convenient for in-home use but you can deal with it as I did.The loud fan did have one benefit: the amp never changed temps above the room after all my tests.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI powered on the unit and ran the dashboard and was immediately disappointed with the very high distortion:I checked all of my connections and distortion persisted.  I almost didn\\'t run the rest of my tests but decided to do anyway.  As another 5 to 10 minutes passed, I noticed the performance had improved so I went back and re-measured the dashboard again:I have never seen an amplifier improve by 11 dB after brief warm up.  Some kind of thermal compensation is left out to save money I guess.  If the fan was not running, you could leave it running all the time but with the fan, I certainly would not.  Anyway, the ranking is still below average but at least not in the broken category:Frequency response shows anomalies in the filtering of the switching design:Depending on your speaker and its impedance, you may get accentuated highs.  There is also low frequency roll off which indicates likely capacitor coupling.Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about:Crosstalk is kind of average:Power versus distortion and noise into 4 ohm load shows unacceptable rise at higher power levels:We get the rated power and no more:Into 8 ohm performance is rather strange:Weird to see that smooth and gradual rise in distortion as if not much feedback is used.Sweeps versus different frequencies indicates the same issue as distortion rises with frequency:Finally, without my AES filter, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:Pretty ugly but levels are low and of course well above our hearing.ConclusionsThe cheap looks, loud fan, and lack of power for a pro amp was enough for me to dislike the Monoprice 605030.  Then I wondered what else you could get for so little money and there is nothing that comes close.  Hell, if this doesn\\'t work as an amp, you would get your money\\'s worth in the form of chassis, power supply, etc!Personally, I am too much of an equipment elitist to want to buy this amp.  I would pay more to get a quiet unit, with more power and slightly better looks.  But you all can decide as you want.',\n",
       " \" Starke Sound AD4.320 four channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member new and drop shipped to me.  It costs US $1,499 but they have had sales with prices as low as US $900.The Ad4.320 looks a bit industrial and is quite heavy for a class D amplifier:The reason for heavy weight is dual linear transformers and power supply on the right side.  Usually class D amplifiers use switching power supplies which keeps the unit light.  My own switching amplifier also uses a linear power supply with its weight and size penalty.I was pleased to see balanced inputs and triggers for remote on and off:As you can see, you can bridge two channels together and get double the power.  Unlike other amps that require funky connections, you have two dedicated terminals with a slide switch to select the mode (which need to be activated when power is off).  When I powered on the unit, I could not get output out of one channel.  I switched the bridge mode left and right (when off) and it got both working.  For bulk of my testing I tested channels 1 and 2.Starke Sound AD4.320 MeasurementsWe start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a load of 4 ohm with power of 5 watts:Gain is atypically low at 21 dB (usually it is in 28 to 32 dB).  Not a problem with our dedicated DACs as they can easily provide the voltage the unit needs.  Sadly we have high 2nd and 3rd harmonics that cause SINAD to droop down to 73 dB. This is well below average of all amplifiers tested:We are talking chip-amp performance level here not anything that would come at this price range.Signal to noise ratio is better but not exciting:Multitone test shows rapid rise in distortion with frequency:The class D amplifier filter is not inside the feedback loop so shows high sensitivity to load:This means the tonality you get may depend on the actual impedance of the speaker you use.  Crosstalk between channels 1 and 2 is very good:Key performance metric for any amplifier is powered and I was very surprised to see far less power than specified:We are not even in the same planet with 104 watts vs spec  of 320!  I switched channel 2 to 3 just in case there is a power supply limit but it almost made no difference.  We are still way short of the company specs:Story repeated with 8 ohm load:Forgetting about lack of power, we also have very early rise in distortion and rising before clipping.I thought maybe they had used peak power to rate the amplifier but that is not in the same vicinity either:We do see the benefit of the linear amplifier in the way it allows higher burst power than tightly regulated switching power supplies.Sweeping the frequency and measuring power and THD+N, shows smooth lines which is good but they are quite elevated at higher frequencies:ConclusionsThe AD4.320 underperforms in so many categories.  You can argue about audibility of this and that measurements but not the lack of power. That, you will hear.  Is the unit broken?  Could be but it doesn't perform like it is broken.  I thought maybe it is set to 240 volts but it is clearly marked as being a 120 volt unit (see the back panel picture).  And at any rate, if they shipped the amp this way to a US customer, then that is what they are going to get.I can't recommend the Starke Audio AD4.320.  Getting four channels with so much power would have been a good value if they had delivered.  But when they don't, there is no reason to buy it.\",\n",
       " ' Emotiva XPA HC-1 Monoblock amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $879.As the name indicates, this is a single channel power amplifier. I have a soft spot for monoblocks and the HC-1 hits it. I especially like the power button which has buttery action and nice orange color when you hit it. Alas, then it switches to the cold, trademark blue color of Emotiva. Wish they would switch to that orange!Note that the amplifier is *very* deep, probably three times as deep as it is high.  Back panel shows nice inclusion of XLR input which is what I used for testing:The design of the amplifier is Class AB with dual power supply rails in order to keep power consumption low at lower powers. It did that as the amplifier barely generated any heat during my testing.  I was not a fan of the protection circuit though as when it clicked in (during 20 kHz sweep), it required power switch in the back to be toggled.  I like self-resetting protection circuits and if that is not possible, have the front panel be used for that purpose.If you are not familiar with my amplifier measurements, I highly suggest watching this video on amplifier measurements.Emotiva HC-1 Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard using XLR input:My eye quickly went to the high distortion products which sadly lands the HC-1 at well below average of all amplifiers tested:Even though SINAD is distortion dominated above, noise performance at 5 watts is not anything to write home about either:I like to see an amplifier above budget prices to clear 16 bit hurdle of 96 dB at 5 watts.  Or else, sensitive speakers may spit out noise.Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and good bandwidth:Multitone test patter shines a familiar light on the amplifier when it comes to distortion:In an attempt to have more common measurements with other sites, I decided to run the 19+20 kHz intermodulation distortion (although I don\\'t know what power others use):Spray of intermodulation products around our dual tones don\\'t paint a pretty picture.Let\\'s run our power sweeps:We do have a lot of power but alas, that comes at the expensive of noise+distortion.  Allowing for 1% THD distortion, we do get a lot of power:Rail switching design (\"Class H\") shows distinct change in performance as that happens:Notice how distortion is lowest around our 1 kHz testing and increased when you go lower or higher in frequency.  The latter is kind of expected but not the lower.ConclusionsThe Emotiva brand is one of budget prices but with high performance.  Alas, after testing many of their products, the right message here is budget prices with slightly below average performance.  Company really needs to retool their products and bring up the objective performance up a notch or two.  Then they will have a winning formula.  As is, we see products like HC-1 here which underperform more than half the amplifiers ever tested (over 400).  Fortunately it is very powerful so likely sounds OK.I can\\'t recommend the Emotiva XPS HC-1 amplifier.  It is an OK amp but we are not here for OK products.',\n",
       " ' Rega IO stereo integrated amplifier with phono input.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $649 on Amazon including Prime shipping.  It is designed and built in UK and price there seems much more reasonable (379 pounds).The front panel doesn\\'t do much for me:It is function though with a simple input switch and power.  The inclusion of remote control is a nice touch:Courtesy of the company heritage in building turntables, it has phono input built-in.  No digital inputs  which is an odd omission in this day and age.Rega IO Amplifier MeasurementsWith power amplifiers I let them run at about 5 watts into my 4 ohm load and watch their distortion+noise to see when it stabilizes.  It did not in the case of Regao IO and contrary to audiophile belief, kept getting worse!I watched every video review of this box while waiting but it would simply not stabilize.  At around 23:00 minute, I started to sense the smell of electronics running too hot so I put my hand on it.  That was a mistake as it darn near burned it!  The sides were quite hot.  I took an IR picture of it:As you see the left and right bars run much hotter with the back end being at around 45 degrees C.  This is in open air in cool weather where we live.  Imagine what it would do at higher power delivery and when put in a cabinet.  Not good.  Company provides lifetime warranty but says it won\\'t include wear and tear.  Wonder if it cooks itself whether they repair it under warranty.Anyway, let\\'s get on with our testing starting with our dashboard:A lot of things stand out.  For starters, the channel gain is not matched.  The mismatch seemed to be volume pot independent.  Then there is the matter of very high levels of mains hum and harmonics.  No matter what I did with grounding, it would not make any difference whatsoever.   The mains noise is actually higher in energy than the harmonics.  That is not a bad thing in that our sensitivity at lower frequencies is much lower than at higher ups.SINAD sums all the noise and distortion and lands the IO in the \"fair\" category:This is well below average of nearly 79 dB.Signal to noise ratio as a result is nothing to write home about:I was surprised that despite being a simple class AB design, it doesn\\'t have flat response in audible band:Most shocking measurement was that of crosstalk:Here is our multitone test showing the impact of distortion:Company specs the amp at just 30 watts into 8 ohm and good news is that it delivers that:But this is not much power.  Here is what we get into 4 ohm:Thankfully being a class AB amplifier with unregulated power supply, it does better in burst mode:Modern speakers are built in compact enclosure that reduces their efficiency greatly.  I am not sure this is enough power.Here is our frequency stepped response:Class AB designs sport clean transfer functions and the Rega is no exception.  Typical of all amps though, you lose power at very low frequencies.  Usually you have a lot to loosing some is not super painful.  Here though, you don\\'t so that is not good news.Phono Stage MeasurementsThere is no preamp output so I decided to use the headphone output to measure the RIAA equalization:Good showing here assuming you prefer less bass to LP rumble.Headphone Output MeasurementsCompany specifies the headphone output as having an impedance of > 100 ohm which is massive.  It will cause frequency response error in vast number of headphones which have variable impedance.  And on those flat ones which tend to be low, it will dissipate a lot of power internally:This is basically a checklist feature and not something that you want to use for any serious headphone listening.ConclusionsI have a soft spot for western companies trying to compete with Asian ones in budget audio products.  Alas, performance has to be there to do the job and for the most part, it is not with Rega IO.  Capability is poor as far as power output.  Measurements like crosstalk are horrid.  Headphone output is years behind times with super high impedance.  And then we have the large amount of heat this generates.  If this were a powerful amplifier I could understand idling high but not when all you have is 30 watts into 8 ohm.  Amplifiers have a tough life and you want them to be reliable.  I am not sure how long the IO will last given the elevated temps under which it operates.I don\\'t know that this is a terrible amplifier but when test after test makes me cringe, I have no choice but to withhold recommendation for Rega IO.Edit: see teardown here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/rega-io-amplifier-teardown.27735/',\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A300 stereo amplifier with balanced and Bluetooth inputs. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $177.I like that you can easily defeat the tone controls now and select one of three inputs, allowing the amp to replace a pre-amplifier as well.Especially nice is inclusion of power supply which is a rarity in budget/small amps:The speaker terminals are small but typical for the price class.I could see an aluminum heatsink in the box for the power device/IC.  In use though, it never warmed up above room temp.  Neither the top, or the bottom registered a temperature rise which is nice.AIYIMA A300 MeasurementsLet's start with unbalanced RCA input first, setting the gain to 29 dB as with other amps I test with adjustable gain:Switching to balanced we essentially get the same performance:That distortion spike at nearly -72 dB limits SINAD to below average:In fairness and comparison to a few amplifiers with much lower gain, I also tested the amp at 12 dB gain:A bit better but still not enough to cross the average line.  For the rest of the tests, I stuck with XLR input and 29 dB gain.Here is our SNR:These are disappointing numbers relative to what AIYIMA has shown it can do.Multitone test result is not too bad:Crosstalk is good:Frequency response unfortunately shows load dependency:Key here is to see if we can get more power out of this small package and we do:Interestingly, we get almost as much with 8 ohm load!Back to 4 ohm load, with short bursts we get a lot more power:Finally, there is little frequency/power dependency which is very good for a class D amplifier:Warm Up Time MeasurementAmplifier stabilizes quickly:ConclusionsIt would have been great if the A300 had followed the footsteps of previous AIYIMA amps but with more power.  Alas, it delivers on more power at the expense of noise and distortion.  Assuming you don't hear the noise, it may be the right trade off in a budget amplifier.  On packaging, I really like the integrated box with XLR inputs.  Amplifier power supplies can be huge and that is avoided here. I am personally snobbish and want my power with low noise and distortion so can't recommend the AIYIMA A300.  But your priorities may be different.\",\n",
       " ' Crown XLS2502 DriveCore (switching) 2-channel amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The XLS 2502 cost US $645 including free shipping from Amazon.  It has DSP functionality which I did not test.  And is specified to drive 2 ohm load.From the outside, the XLS2502 is built like a tank:It is very light of course due to switching topology for the amplifier and power supply.  But also very sturdy with plenty of steel to keep its shape.The two gain controls are notched which gives them a nice feeling but the gain is not matched and is hard to get there using those notches.Here is the back connectivity:There is a fan as you see but in normal testing it never came up. During stress testing, it did come on but was pretty quiet compared to what I expected.  Mind you, I don\\'t think you want it close to you if it is going to be running.Alas, the fan was insufficient to keep the unit cool under full power.  The red thermal indicators came up even though the fan was running.  The amp seemed to be functioning still but to be on the safe side, I terminated my testing there.  In typical home use, even for subwoofer duty, I doubt that this is a concern as you will see later as far as what wattage we are talking about.Overall, the impression of the amplifier is positive, making you think you have something made to be run over by a car and still function reliably.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:I set the gain to 29 dB for consistency.  I also tested it at 19 dB gain and it only made 1 to 2 dB improvement.  The reason is that SINAD (signal relative to noise+distortion) is dominated by harmonic distortion.  Here, those harmonics are very high order which perceptually is not very good as they are not masked as easily.  Anyway, with a SINAD of 71 dB, we have below average performance:The XLS1502 did a bit better in this regard, garnering a SINAD of 77 dB.Frequency response shows the same sharp cut off:I don\\'t know if this can be changed using DSP programming or not.Above is with resistive load.  Switching to a simulation of a 2-way speaker gets us little difference:So there is some speaker dependency but I would not lose sleep over it.Crosstalk is OK but could be better:The red line is a $30 amplifier by the way.32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" gives a more hopeful picture of distortion:The spray of harmonics is high in frequency where our hearing threshold is higher.Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts but gets better at full power:Lower gain settings may improve this a few dBs.Amplifier Power MeasurementsYou don\\'t buy this amplifier to listen at 5 watts so let\\'s see what it can do when its wings are given enough room to fly:Wow!  Nearly 500 watts of power is delivered into both channels simultaneously.  The good news doesn\\'t end there. Check out these ratings when distortion is relaxed to 1%:1600 watts of peak power is delivered out of standard 120 volt outlet!  These thing is a powerful beast.Noise level is decent but I wanted to make sure the high gain was not impacting it.  So I reduced gain to 19 dB which required some 6 volts of input to drive to clipping:There is no difference at all.For the rest of these tests I stayed at 19 dB gain.  Here is the power output with 8 ohm:Over 300 watts at what should be inaudible distortion for most people.Finally we get to my stress test.  I played with the settings because the high frequency noise shaping would not let me perform the sweep.  So I decided to change this test and set the limit to 22.4 kHz (instead of usual 90 kHz) and limit the sweep to 6 kHz.  That way, the third harmonic of 6 kHz (18 kHz) is still included in the computation.  No music has full power at high frequencies anyway so I don\\'t think we need to keep measuring to 20 kHz with respect to power.  Here is the output:As noted, the red warning lights came on as the sweep was going from right to left so I terminated the test.  Delivered output was about 520 watts which is still plenty but is naturally lower than 1 kHz which was in high 600s.ConclusionsThese pro amps have mastered the technique of delivering tons of power with distortion and noise kept under control.  Lack of power is the #1 reason an amplifier can sound bad.  Don\\'t care how good the SINAD is at 5 watt.  If you run out of power, you will hear distortion, lack of dynamics, etc.  So if you need the power, it is best to get it than to have less of it.  And on that front, the Crown XLS 2502 delivers tons of it, breaking all previous records for any amplifier I have tested.  The price is ridiculously low for the amount of power you get as well.Ideally, you would use more finessed amplifiers above bass frequencies and use the XLS 2502 to drive the subs.  But if not, the XLS2502 can deliver good performance.Overall, I am going to recommend the XLS 2502.',\n",

Parts Express is selling it for US $650 right now.The APA1200DSP has nicer look than typical pro amplifiers:The back is especially nice with the type of connectivity you need in a home system:Both analog and digital inputs are provided.  Ethernet input allows a nicely done web interface to be used from anywhere:There is a microphone I believe and ability to automatically calibrate the room response.  I did not use or dive into this functionality.There is a fan that came on when powered on but nicely powered down gradually and I did not hear it during operation.  When it runs it has a lower frequency and a bit less annoying than on pro amplifiers.There is a strange setting for 2 vs 4 ohm speaker load.  I set it to 4 since I tested it at 4 and 8 ohms.  Manual doesn't say exactly what this does.APA1200DSP Amplifier MeasurementsI set the gain to -10 dB which gave me the nominal 29 dB I look for and measured using XLR input:Switching to digital input showed essentially the same performance:This level of noise+distortion (SINAD) puts this amp way down in our rankings:Noise level was not very good either, using analog or digital input:Unit was stable on power up which is good:Crosstalk was decent:Multitone suffered from high noise floor and sporadic distortion spikes:Sadly frequency response is highly load dependent due to class D amp's output filter interacting:We also see sharp cut off due to internal processing being at low sampling rate.  Switching to digital input at 96 kHz sampling made no difference:The name indicates it produces 1200 watts.  Let's see what it can do into 4 om with both channels driven:The curve wiggles as protection circuit kicks in.  Prior to that, it produced 370 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% didn't do much better:Switching to 8 ohm naturally cut the power substantially:Stepping through the test frequency shows a number of odd behaviors:ConclusionsTypical of this class of amplifier, power specs are mostly imaginary.  Objective measurement of noise and distortion are also typical with little attention paid to minimize them.  So you are left with buying this for functionality not because it has any great implementation of class D amplification.I can't recommend the Dayton Audio APA1200DSP DSP based on its pure measured performance.

The rear of the amp is a bit unusual in placing the mains input between the connectors:Would have thought to put the IEC jack all the way to the left and speaker to the right.  Doesn't matter if the performance is good anyway.Is this the first audio product we have tested from Serbia?Vista Audio Spark MeasurementsI had to crank the volume all the way up to get close to my nominal 29 dB gain (per THX spec):Boy, that is a lot of power supply noise.  Playing with grounding reduced the spikes at 60 Hz a bit but did nothing to the harmonics which are caused by the internal power supply.  Even if that was low, the distortion spikes are not.  As a result, the amplifier rates quite low in our overall ranking:Signal to noise ratio is better than what we saw in the dashboard indicating the noise floor rises with power:I was surprised to see a bass roll off in this day and age where just about every amplifier is dc-coupled:Multitone shows a messy response with the lows polluted by the power supply and highs due to inadequate feedback:Crosstalk is below average:The amplifier is rated at only 20 watts but I was not able to get that:It did better actually with 8 ohm load indicating current delivery is its issue:Back to 4 ohm, if you allow more distortion or buRst the input, you do get a bit more power:Finally, there is fair bit of variability when we sweep frequencies:ConclusionsSometimes I really wonder what appeal such amplifiers have that attract buyers.  This amp has too little power to drive most speakers and has a lot of noise and distortion as well.  There must be some mystique about it that I don't understand.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Vista Audio Spark II amplifier.  I hope the designer sees these measurements and at least works to sharply reduce the power supply noise as that can't be anything good no matter what school you are from.\",\n",
       " ' Parasound Zamp V.3 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The version I have is a revision or two older than what Parasound builds (I think).  The latest version is being sold on Amazon for US $277 including Prime shipping.  Considering this is a brand name company and we have a class AB amplifier, this seems like a reasonable price.The Zamp V.3 comes in a tiny and rather cute, half-rack package:In addition to power button, you also have a headphone jack.  From the bit I have read, the output is just the amplifier with a resistor inline.  This means its output impedance is high (not good) and likely noisy as well.  I did not test it.The back panel exposes good bit of control not seen on \"normal\" hifi amplifiers:Parasound has a leg in two industries: the Custom Integration (CI) channel and hifi.  The former is for companies who install these amplifiers in hide-away places to for example power a couple of speakers for a bedroom TV.  The gain controls and such give flexibility to this kind of installation as does the small form factor (the amp could be hidden behind a flat panel TV.  Being part of this channel means that when the automation is redone in a home using it, these units are ripped out and put on sale at low prices.  I see this amp advertised for as little as $149 on ebay.I was shocked when I read that this amp was class AB and after I looked inside and saw a heavy and large pancake toroidal transformer.   How the heck did they put in inefficient class AB amp in there with no heatsinking that was visible?  The answer came to me after I let the unit warm up for a little over 5 minutes at 5 watts being output from each channel.  The amp went dead and displayed a thermal overload!  It can\\'t produce just 10 watts for five minutes?  No, it can\\'t. I touched the bottom of the amp and it nearly burned my hand.  A narrow painted strip of metal fastened to the chassis carries the brunt of heat generated.  Being on the bottom and having no fins means that the heat is not spread at all resulting in overheating.  I put a cooling fan on it and it took a good 2 to 3 minutes to come back to life.  And I ran the rest of the tests that way.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWell, this ain\\'t a pretty sight.  One channel is much worse than the other.  No amount of playing with the grounding, or messing with the switch in the back helped with any of the mains/power supply related tones either.  The averaged ranking is below mean of all of the amps tested so far (77 amplifiers to date!):Crosstalk was poor, matching a $25 amplifier I tested:Frequency response is OK:Noise performance as you can predict from the dashboard is not fantastic:Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet\\'s get into the most important bit which is power capability starting with 4 and going into 8 ohms:Weird how one channel goes crazy at just 1 to 2 watt.  Specs are matched though.Allowing for higher distortion of 1% doesn\\'t help with max power but does give us more burst power:Thermal StabilityHere is the test that resulted in the shutdown:I was messing with grounding and caused that little blip so ignore that.ConclusionsI really like the cute and small form factor of this amp for desktop use.  Alas, with a weak thermal management, it won\\'t produce much volume before shutting down.  Used ones have probably had a hard life due to this reason as well.  If you are going to play with one and want to shy away from the million switching amplifiers out there in this price range, go ahead.  But I can\\'t recommend the unit.',\n",

The A-U671 costs US 499 but most vendors say it is no longer available even though it shows as current on Yamaha site.  How fast modern gear becomes obsolete...Yamaha has been clever to mimic the look of 1970s and 1980s switchgear:Alas, the controls are plastic and don't have nearly the nice feel of their old brethren.  The volume control is motorized though and is operable through the remote. A built-in DAC and analog input would nicely satisfy many people.  Unfortunately the unit arrived with something rattling in it. I took it part to find out it was a clamp of sort for the power supply bundle that had come loose.  I put it back together and all worked except the USB DAC.  I could control it, change its sample rate and such but it would not produce audio (with stock or Yamaha driver).  Another one of the power supply screws was also loose.  They should have put thread lock on them so that they don't come loose. The back panel is as expected but with decent quality speaker terminals:Since I had to take the unit apart anyway, here is a quick teardown:The DAC is on top and the amp on the bottom of the green board.  The yellow board is the switching power supply.  And that black wrapper is what had come lose.In use the amp was very quick to shut down on overload.  It would actually power off telling me it may be the power supply that is undersized. Temperature rise is not remotely an issue. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load @ 5 watts:I set the volume control manually to 29 dB as I normally do with integrated amps.  SINAD which represents the worst of noise and/or distortion is dominated by distortion.  At 70 dB, this is well below average:Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about either:Crosstalk is good (one channel bleeding into another):Frequency response is problematic, showing that it changes with your speaker load:Multitone shows frequency dependent error and high noise floor:Here are the power ratings:The regulated switching power supply allows no headroom:Thermal StabilityNot a whole lot changed with warm-up:ConclusionsI have a soft spot for the look of the Yamaha A-U671.  And inclusion of a USB DAC in a light and compact enclosure.  Not much else to hang your hat on from there on.  If you can find one at a yard sale for $100 it would be a good purchase.  I don't know that I would buy it over so many other modern choices with Room EQ and streaming built-in.\",\n",
       " ' Naim Uniti Atom streamer, DAC and integrated amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $3,799.The overall industry design is attractive and has a high-end look to it.  Alas, every part of the unit has an ultra sharp edge from heatsinks to edges of the plexiglass (?) front panel.  It is a heavy box which makes you really feel those sharp edges as if they are going to tear into your skin.  It was unpleasant every time I had to move or rotate the unit.The front panel is large and sharp which I like.  Alas, and strangely so, it is not a touch screen.  In this day and age and at this price, a touchscreen is a requirement in my opinion.  A very large rotary control managed the volume.  It seem to have some kind of acceleration but wasn\\'t very intuitive.Here is the back panel:I was surprised to see the compact binding posts that are made only for banana plugs.  Likewise there is no USB B to use the unit as a DAC.  Maybe you can use the type-A connector for that but even so, it is very unusual choice.  Nice to see a floating ground switch.  In my testing, it only impacted the networked tests.  Otherwise it had no effect.Inclusion of HDMI is very important to allow sound from TV to be piped into it.Upon booting and with Ethernet cable plugged in, it nicely told me there is new firmware.  It took something like 10 minutes to download the image and then went into a seemingly infinity cycles of booting, dark screen, non-descript progress bar and power button that would fade on or off or solid on.  I left there for probably half hour when it finally seem to be ready.There is the usual app to control it but I opted for the included remote control.  It too has very sharp edges but otherwise functional.Naim Uniti Atom DAC MeasurementsI started by testing the unit using Coax due to lack of type-B or type-c USB port.  Here is our usual dashboard:Distortion dominates causing our SINAD (noise+distortion) to barely reach into \"fair\" category:Distortion rises into the noise floor of even 16 bit content so not a good first showing.  As noted, changing the grounding mode made no difference in any of these measurements.The output stage is capable of higher voltage which is nice:Good to see the output does not become all distorted once the internal amplifier is pushed beyond clipping. Noise performance is not competitive with even budget DACs but almost good enough for 16-bit playback:Multitone distortion was quite high:Jitter display looks clean but noise floor is high and is masking interference patterns:Levels of those spurious tones though is quite low and inaudible (-128 dB).We have a rather odd filter response:This partially contributes to rather poor noise+distortion relative to frequency:Finally, linearity matches the fair performance of the rest of the system:Naim Uniti Atom Amplifier MeasurementGiven the choice of analog or digital input, I tested both which producing 5 watts:Performance is very close so I opted to use analog in as that makes the comparison to other amps easier.  Notice the high power supply noise at 120 Hz (double mains frequency in US).  Overall ranking is well below average:Frequency response test with analog input shows a brick wall filter which indicates input is being digitized:Shame then that no DSP functionality is provided.  The roll off filter in the ADC causes some drooping in the high frequencies.Crosstalk response was kind of shaky but overall good:Multitone test once again shows less than optimal performance:Rated power is low and that is what we see:Sweeping the frequency for power measurement we get orderly response:Notice the typical sharp drop in power at 20 Hz.  This is why you need more powerful amplifier than you think you are getting.  Power is needed in bass but the reservoir capacitors in the power supply get depleted and you don\\'t get as much output.Naim Unit Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI expected the headphone output to be \"junk\" but it actually is not:That is plenty of output for satisfactory response of high impedance headphones.  Noise floor is not competitive with any modern/recommended headphone amp but could have been far worse.  At 32 ohm though, available power is much more limited:Sweeping the load we see that the headphone amplifier is not capable of much current delivery:So best to stay with high impedance headphones.Naim Uniti Atom Streaming MeasurementsI ran the streaming tests a day later and here, I noticed noise bleeding into the output:So I tried the ground lift switch and it remedied that:SINAD though is dominated by high distortion so didn\\'t matter one way or the other.  And performance is the same as local/coax S/PDIF input.ConclusionsPerformance of Naim Atom ranges from fair/adequate to rather poor.  Shame that when you pay so much for a piece of audio, not much design hygiene is included.  I suspect more went into software development and enclosure design than making sure the hardware is performant.  I hope for a version 2 the company works to substantially improve the performance of these subsystems.  I am sure many buy a Naim product thinking they are getting great audio performance.I can\\'t recommend the Naim Uniti Atom streaming amplifier.P.S.  I was going to give the mailman panther rating to the unit but he is out making deliveries......',\n",
       " ' vintage Audio Research D300 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a local member.  The D300 came out circa 1995 and initially cost US $3,500 but then price rose to US $4,000.  Quick search shows used ones going for US $1,500.The D300 is built like a tank:I am confident you could drive over it and nothing will happen to it.  Even the handles are massive which is a blessing as an ultra heavy transformer sits vertically behind the front panel. I could carry the D300 by myself so it is not too heavy to be unmanageable. The back panel is as you expect:With one exception: the non-detachable power cord.   What is there though seems amply sufficient as it is supple yet quite thick.Heatsinks are very thick gauge and in use, they got warm but not hot.  The rest of the case got warm as well.  The amp never complained no matter what I did to it in testing.Overall, if you want an understated but high quality feel, that is what you have in D300.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Ouch.  Lots of second harmonic causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion and noise to be rather poor.  As such the D300 lands well below average in our list of some 62 amplifiers tested to date:Noise performance was quite good though so it is the distortion that is the problem:32-tone test signal representing \"music\" showed what we already know as far as rather high distortion levels:Frequency response was excellent:As was crosstalk (one channel bleeding into the other):Let\\'s get into the meat of the measurements with power vs THD+N starting at 4 ohm:Boy, this is worse than the dashboard indicated.  Almost immediately, distortion takes over and keeps climbing.  While the D300 is much more quiet, it quickly loses to an integrated home theater receiver (NAD T758)!  Not good.Same story repeats for 8 ohm load:Distortion is so high at higher power levels that if we set a limit of 0.1% for THD+N, we only get 60 watts out of each channel!Relaxing that to 0.2% though gave us a lot more power and no indication of frequency mattering.  This was proven yet again in our multiple sweeps:All the lines fall on top of each other indicating the amp just doesn\\'t care what frequency you feed it.  It amplifies it, adds a heap of distortion and that is that. Makes you want to cry and celebrate at the same time!ConclusionsThere is clear excellence in the engineering in Audio Research D300.  Build quality is superb as well.  There must have been a conscious decision to use low amount of feedback which translated into rising distortion with power.  It is a shame that capable designers follow audiophile myths to build non-performant amplifiers when they could do so much better.In this day and age, this type of performance is not competitive so I really can\\'t recommend the D300.  Then again if you want something with high build quality and can get the unit on the cheap, it makes for a decent option.',\n",
       " \" Topping PA3 desktop amplifier.  I have had a ton of requests to measure this amplifier so I asked the company to send me one.  They said they would do so but cautioned me that it would not measure well.  The PA3 costs US $120 on Amazon including free shipping.I must stay, compared to all the budget amplifiers I have tested, the PA3 looks like luxury goods!  It comes in a hefty case and oozes quality:There are dual inputs as you see which you can control using the power button.  A massive, Topping branded external power supply is provided which even goes as far as having textured design on the back side:Most importantly, all the regulatory certifications are there which we know from past examination to be true and certified by third-party labs.  This is one budget amplifier I wouldn't hesitate to leave on unattended.Implementation is based on TDA7498E ST Micro chip amp.  Topping PA3 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm using 1 kHz tone:As you see I adjusted the volume control to give us the nominal 29 dB gain I usually test at.  SINAD is dominated by distortion which at 0.036% which correlates well with ST Micro's 0.05% spec at 1 watt.  Alas, this is well below average for all amplifiers we have tested and some of the latest chip amp products:SNR slots in the same bucket of performance:Crosstalk is pretty good showing good attention to isolation:Frequency response unfortunately is very load dependent:We get about 51 watts into 4 ohm with both channels driven with distortion dominating (hence the reason the graph doesn't slope down):Power naturally drops with 8 ohm load but not as much some others I have seen:Peak power matches company spec which is a novelty in this space:Note that there was a really strong protection circuit that would not allow me to push the amp more than I did for max power so I had to settle for lower distortion of 0.5%.  It would shut down if I told it to work harder to hit 1%.Distortion takes off rather quickly with frequency as we see in multitone test:Same is see in our frequency versus power and distortion+noise:Fortunately our hearing threshold starts to go up at higher frequencies so audibility is less impacted than our sensibility about good engineering.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping did what it could to build a reliable, safe and robust desktop platform for this amplifier.  Alas, they are held down significantly by the performance of the underlying chip amp which is likely all that was available at the time this product was designed.  Being selfish elitist audiophile engineering types that we are, we have no choice but to pass on this amplifier.  If you are not picky however and want something that is build safe and well, you could choose otherwise.So to repeat, I can't recommend the Topping PA3 based on its audio performance.  Hopefully there are future products based on a better platform.\",\n",

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,599.The front panel of the Sphinx portrays a high-end look with its thick metal:Alas, that thin metal surrounding it, takes that impression away.  I liked the very wide apart inputs and output terminals which \"should\" bode well for crosstalk measurements:There is good bit of weight to the unit courtesy of power transformer.  I like the inclusion of the balance control.  As you see in the first picture, I had to use it to get same gain out of both channels.  Protection circuit was well done with automatic recovery and worked great no matter how hard I pushed it.Internal amplification is provided by a pair of Hypex UCD 180 OEM class D amplifiers.  A buffer state made out of tubes completes the picture.The amplifier has won many accolades as indicated by their mention on the product page:Let\\'s see if objectively they are right.Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 MeasurementsAs usual, I set the gain to 29 dB and feed the amp a 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm at 5 watts and see what we get:What we get is not very nice.  Broad set of harmonics to the tune of -80 dB do away with any notion of \"tube sound.\"  Add fair bit of noise and SINAD which is a measure of distortion+noise sinks quite low:That\\'s 10 dB worse than the media across 140 amplifiers tested so far.  Not good.  As a reference, Hypex specifications shows a SINAD of 84 dB so 15 dB was lost in the addition of the buffer stage in this amplifier.Another thing that is not good is signal to noise ratio:So even at full power your 2 bits short of CD\\'s dynamic range. The shocker was the normally \"innocent\" crosstalk test which just about every amplifier does well in:Then comes Sphinx, losing to our $20 throw-away amplifier!  Clearly zero attention was paid to isolation of the two channels.Frequency response also shows sloppy attention to producing the audible band properly:Let\\'s measure our power vs distortion:Definitely much less happy driving 4 ohm load.  Here is our peak and max power:So moderately powerful although without much headroom.ConclusionsRogue Audio takes a perfectly serviceable Hypex UcD 180 amplifiers and adds copious amount of noise and distortion with its front-end.  Mind you, despite use of the tube, it doesn\\'t give that 2nd harmonic dominant result.  It just raises the noise and distortion, robbing you of transparency.  But hey, folks buy audio products by how many myths are included in their design and Rogue audio gets there with that tube stage.  Perfect marketing, poor engineering.  Story of high-end audio.Needless to say, I can NOT recommend the Rogue Audio Sphinx V3.  You can get plenty of better amplifiers for this level of money.',\n",

It costs US $399.As pro amplifiers go, the NX3000D is half attractive especially when on with its amber lights and LEDs:There are variable (analog) gains as you see.  I did not play with the DSP or menu system but it lets you do such useful things as setting up a crossover to drive a sub.  There is built-in power limiting in there.The unit is quite light.  So light that you think it may fly away given its large and noisy fan:The fan unfortunately is not temperature sensitive and wails away upon power up!  I am sure saving weight is a big deal when you try to squeeze every dollar out of shipping costs.  Good news is that as they advertise, this thing runs as cool as it can get.  After a bunch of testing, the temperature was the same as the room.Note that speaker connections are SpeakOn which I like but not common in consumer audio.  Inputs are only balanced XLR/1/4 combo.  There is extra gain though to use RCA unbalanced with them using an adapter.  Where I placed the gain knobs provided 29 dB of gain.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amp 1 kHz and see what else it outputs beside that at 5 watts into 4 ohm test load:What it outputs is a bunch of distortion in the form of third harmonic at 3 kHz placing the unit well below average:Note also the disparity in channel output which you can also see in the frequency response measurement:The gain controls are notched so not easy to select any in-between gains to adjust for this.Another news is how narrow the bandwidth is.  Being a DSP amplifier, it digitizes the input and it seems to use 48 kHz sampling resulting in bandwidth of 24 kHz.Noise performance is not that great at 5 watts, falling well below 96 dB we like to see for CD/streaming 16-bit content:Fortunately at full power (right), you do clear that hurdle.These amps are sold almost exclusively by how much power they produce versus their cost so let\\'s get into that with 4 ohm load:Seems like the rated power numbers are a fantasy unless they are measured for one channel driven, not two as I do.  Still, 400 watts is lots of power in such a cheap package.  You get a  bit more as well if you allow the distortion to rise to 1% and also measure it as a peak (right):Switching the load to 8 ohms naturally lowers available power:Switching/class-D amps can have complex distortion profiles that highly depend on frequency and power level and we see some of that here:At higher frequencies different distortion mechanisms become dominant causing the curves to go up and down. While I always see some power loss at 20 Hz, it is disappointing to see it dip so low to just 268 watts for an amplifier rated at \"900 watts.\"  Bass is where we need the power.Finally, we can remove our filter and examine the ultrasonic spectrum to see what the amp is producing there:Switching frequency seems to be around 410 kHz which is well above the audible band, and is attenuated quite a lot for a switching amplifier (-26 dB).  I am not too happy to see so much other junk there though although not audible per se.ConclusionsPro amps can often make good alternative to hi-fi amps since they are sold at much lower cost/watt than consumer products.  We get that in Behringer NX3000D but we also get the other drawbacks of pro products in the form of high fan noise.  And distortion that is pretty high.  If you can hide it some place and use it to do drive a subwoofer it should be fine.  But otherwise, I think a more quiet amplifier would work better for home hifif than this unit.Overall, the Behringer NX3000D is not my cup of tea for home use so I can\\'t recommend it.',\n",

Notice the AC terminal doesn\\'t have earth ground and unit is double insulated. In testing I found no effect from earthing the unit or not.Front-end and pre-amps are solid state:Luxman SQ-N150 Amplifier MeasurementsWhen I picked 5 watts as my standard for measuring amplifiers, it was usually a fraction of the amplifier power but here it is nearly half the available power!  So relatively speaker, distortion plays a much strong role than it would otherwise:The high second and third harmonics set the stage as far as SINAD (due to push-pull design) but I wish there was not so much power supply noise.  Sadly the amplifier takes up the ranking of second worst amplifier I have ever measured as far as distortion+noise:Those power supply spikes set the lower bound for dynamic range:It is not too bad but you likely will use very sensitive speakers with this low power amplifier so the numbers may manifest themselves more than they usually do.Frequency response is extended but shows a kink indicating some kind of filter:Crosstalk does not follow the usual curve indicating some sort of resistive (?) element between the two channels:Normally the issue is capacitive which causes the two reference lines you see.Multitone which is supposed to resemble \"music\" with its 32 tone, shows strong level of \"grass\" (intermodulation distortion):Hard to make a case that you are hearing more detail when so much is masked at this power level.I don\\'t have a 6 ohm load so used my usual 4 and 8 ohm loads for power testing:Edit: forgot to post the different frequency sweeps:Luxman SQ-N150 Phono Stage MeasurementsThe amplifier noise and distortion dwarfs the phono stage so I only checked its frequency response:So very good on this critical measurement.Luxman SQ-N150 Headphone MeasurementsFor same reason as above, I just made a power measurement:Seems usable from power availability point of view but noise and distortion are quite high.  Company specifies 16 ohm output impedance and wisely recommends against using low impedance headphones for good reason:The headphone amplifier is simply connected to the amplifier output using the aforementioned resistor which eats up all the power.  It will also change the frequency response of your headphone if it is not flat.  So best to be avoided.Luxman SQ-N150 Listening TestsMy lab speaker is an infinity R253 which has a sensitivity of 87 dB.  I connected it to the SQ-N150 and started to listen.  I had to immediately acknowledge the lack of power as the volume control not only maxed out but there was so much distortion as to cause crackling noise.  I backed off to moderate listening level and the sound was OK but I noticed boominess in the lows as if you have more room modes than you do.  To confirm, I switched to Topping PA5 amplifier on my bench and boominess was gone.  Likely the harmonic distortion of the amplifier is hitting on more room modes causing extra bass/boominess.  I can see if your speakers/setup lacks bass that you experience a bit more of it.The volume control had to be kept below 12:00 o\\'clock.  By 1:00 o\\'clock distortion would start to set in and sound would start to get grungy and rough.  Past 2:00 o\\'clock it would be rather obvious and beyond that, unusable.  There was usable volume with me sitting 5 feet from the single speaker.  With two speakers you could double that but it is still not enough power for me with this speaker.  If an audio reviewer can\\'t hear this level of distortion, they should give up testing audio gear.  Sadly none of the reviews I read made a remark about the distortion.  It is the classic case of paying a lot more and getting a lot less fidelity and enjoyment.ConclusionsThe high level picture here is very clear: wonderful looking, and presumably well built amplifier.  The problem is using tube technology and producing so little power. I see no advantage to it, euphonically or otherwise.  But it is possible for some people the bass impact is a positive.  But at what cost?  So much spent with so little dynamic capability due to lack of power.Needless to say I can\\'t recommend the Luxman SQ-N150. ',\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of Optoma/NuForce STA-200 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  I see it listed for USD $499 including Prime shipping.  Looking elsewhere, it appears to have a list price of $1299.This is one attractive enclosure that does not usually come in a $500 package:The finish is slightly textured and looks pretty nice.Feature wise, there is nothing there but a set of RCA inputs and speakers.  The RCA inputs are paired with speaker terminals on each end of the unit so you better have RCA cables that separate that much.Somewhat out of character is a traditional extruded aluminum heatsink poking out the back.   I guess this avoids having to put the heatsink inside and having to vent the enclosure.  The heatsink is pretty small though and it was cooking even when testing the unit at just 5 watts/channel.  I worry about its ability to run OK at full power for any extended amount of time.Rated power is 80 watts/channel with 8 ohm load.  My testing was at 4 ohm however.Let\\'s get into measurements and see how she does.MeasurementsAs with my previous amplifier tests, let\\'s start with a dashboard view of the unit while it was outputting 5 watts:Boy, this is disappointing.  We have tons of mains and power supply components (which I reduced somewhat by grounding one leg of the speaker terminals to my AP analyzer).  The dominant distortion components are the cause of poor SINAD though with the second harmonic peaking up to nearly -70 dB.  So even if the rest were not there, the SINAD would remain the same.Company states THD+N of < 0.03% and we are essentially there so our testing is correct.  The write-up brags about response up to 1 Mhz and such.  I suspect instead of using fair amount of feedback to bring the distortion down, they have traded for wider bandwidth. Looking at the power rating versus distortion, the STA-200 doesn\\'t bring much to the party over the much cheaper Topping TP60 ($199):Yes, there is less noise at lower power levels but by the time we get to 1 watt, they equalize in performance and at limit, the Topping TP60 (red) actually has less distortion.The spec says the signal to noise ratio is 100 dB.  My measurements fall somewhat short of that:Likely the mains intrusion is the cause (which would vary from installation to installation).Sweeping input level and measuring IMD we get:As with THD, the STA200 has good bit less noise than Topping TP-60 but then suddenly clips and clips badly.  Looking at the gain we see why:This is a lot of gain for a low power amplifier.  No wonder sensitivity is spec\\'ed at just 0.45 volt (versus nominal 2 volts).  This means if you may have to significantly turn down the volume in your pre-amp/dac+pre.  This would make for an amp that plays loud due to its high gain and perhaps that is a conscious choice.Frequency response is reasonable to 40 kHz (0.3 dB down):Anyway, I think we have enough here to know the merits of this amplifier.ConclusionsI was pretty depressed when I reviewed the Topping TP60 and FX Audio FX502SPro and had high hopes that the NuForce STA200 would easily outperform them.  Such was not the case.  The Topping TP60 at less than half the price essentially matches its performance.  It also runs substantially cooler than this unit.  It doesn\\'t look quite as nice though although it has a more manageable desktop form factor if that is how you use it.The NuForce ST-200 seems to cater the audiophile myth of \"fast\" and high-bandwidth amplifiers, sacrificing fidelity to get there.  This is a poor trade off in my book when just about all the content we play is quite band limited.',\n",
       " ' Sabaj A1 desktop (small) amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  Not sure if it is still in production but you can still find it for $60 or so.  Main interest in testing this unit is the use of the TPA3118 class D amplifier which is used in all kinds of other devices including Genelec 8030c powered monitor!For the price the enclosure is not half bad:A little LED display shows the active input (there are two) and current volume level.  As is typical, a laptop sized power supply provides the juice:The unit runs cool.  If you overtax it, it will reset and power back on at low output level.Sabaj A1 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt dashboard:As you see I set the gain to 29 dB which is the \"standard\" I use for integrated amplifiers.  Resulting SINAD is dominated by distortion and is well below average for all amps tested:But... if you compare it to other low cost amps in this price bracket, performance is a good 10 dB better.Noise performance is in the same class:Frequency response is not flat but good to see it rolling off as opposed to peaking:Crosstalk is what you expect in this type of device:Most important is power and this is how the A1 did into 4 ohm:Not a whole lot of power I am afraid.  Pushing it harder didn\\'t do any good either:The power supply runs out of juice and the device shuts down.  May do better with a more powerful power supply.  Here it is into 8 ohm:ConclusionsAs a class I expect these cheap amps to be broken.  The A1 is not that bad.  My concern is too little power.  Many small speakers are inefficient and you need more than 20 watts to get decent performance out of them.  My suggestion is to save on spending money on food and flowers and save up for a better amp.  But if you can\\'t, the Sabaj A1 may do the job for you.As it is, I can\\'t recommend the Sabaj A1.  I am too much of an audio/technology snob to go for it!',\n",
       " ' Pyle PT8000CH 8-channel or 8-zone distribution power amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped by a member and costs US $269. Member purchased it for just $158 on sale!You probably can\\'t tell from the picture but this is a massive box.  It weighs over 50 pounds/23 kilograms and is quite deep.  Rack mounts are provided and needed for both front and back. A review says the back holes don\\'t align right however.  Back panel shows why this amplifier is also tailored for multi-room distribution:\\\\By selecting \"bus mode,\" a single input is distributed to any number of channels from 1 to 8.  In mono or stereo.  Trim pots are provided to adjust the gain for each channel although there were kind of too sensitive to set accurately.The side panels gave me paus until I powered the unit:I feared that those fans would make huge amount of noise but to my pleasant surprise, they barely move and are essentially silent.  They never sped up or got louder during testing.  This is far better solution than my pro amps I test with loud and small fans that are not even temperature sensitive.Back to the front, the power switch is quite bright (blue) and bleeds into the LED bar graphs.  But once the unit is on, the LED bar graphs themselves light up and more or less cover that issue.  The power switch feels quite solid.Pyle as a brand is know for cheap (read junk) so my expectations were not high going into the review.  The overall construction though, with dual toroidal transformers in front, portrayed a different picture.  Let\\'s see how it measures.Pyle PT8000CH MeasurementsI stayed with stereo measurements for this section selecting the channels 7 and 8 that are next to the AC power input.  Warm up allowed the amp to improve a bit:Here is our dashboard:We have a spray of harmonic distortion that sinks SINAD fairly low:Zooming in:We see that the company that it keeps is not too bad!  SNR falls inline or perhaps a bit better:Multitone is as we would expect from the dashboard:Frequency response is good although I wished for a bit more bandwidth as to get a flatter response to 20 kHz:Crosstalk though was surprisingly poor:Let\\'s see how much power we have into 2 channels:Benefit of large power supply comes in when just driving in stereo:Here is 8 ohm performance (company spec = 100 watts):Finally, here is power vs frequency:Here is on/off noise:I hooked up the amplifier to an infinity R253 speaker and I could hear a faint pop on power up.  Power off seemed silent although the fan noise may have masked that.Multichannel Amplifier TestingMy analyzer is only stereo but I drove all channels with the same 8 ohm load.  Here is the output power in stereo and 8 channels:We are meeting spec here which is good (there is some nonsense about 8000 watts peak which we forgive and ignore).All the testing so far has been resistive.  Let\\'s make the load \"reactive\" by 30 and 60 degrees angle and also sweep down to 2 ohm and see what happens:This is quite robust!  At both 4 and 8 ohms, the amp doesn\\'t care if the load is reactive or not.  At 2 ohm though, it starts to complain, dropping its output voltage by nearly half.  Testing at 1 ohm resulted in momentary shutdown.ConclusionsThe build quality of this 8-channel amplifier seems quite substantial.  Massive power supply courtesy of dual toroidal transformers powers the 8 channels well, allowing the amplifier to meet spec.  Distortion and noise are rather high though and rank well below our average.  The amplifier protection and ability to handle complex loads is excellent. You are paying almost nothing for this amplifier (the case alone could cost you this much!) yet you get way above a broken design.  The PT8000CH won\\'t be my main choice for a high-performance 2-channel system but for surround duty and certainly multi-room amplification, it seems fine.I am going to recommend the Pyle PT8000CH.  Not because it has great measured performance as far as noise and distortion.  But that it delivers way, way above its cost point.Edit: teardown is now posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...8000ch-multichannel-amplifier-teardown.43333/',\n",
       " \" Topping MX3 DAC, Bluetooth, Headphone Amplifier, and Power amplifier.  You even get a remote control with it. Despite all that functionality it costs just USD $130 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  I bought mine from Massdrop 10 months ago.  I don't know what I paid but likely less.From the outside, the MX3 looks quite attractive:It has the same design language as the Topping DX3 Pro but even more attractive with that slanted logo.  The volume control is digital and very sensitive.  There is a ton of functionality here which I won't go into as there is a good review of it from Z which I will post after this review.  Suffice it to say, it is very feature rich and well designed for such a bargain product.Everything is powered by an external laptop sized switching power supply:Not only is extra expense incurred in getting a Topping branded power supply, but typical of them it comes with full compliance with regulatory bodies both in US and EU.For most of my testing, I used the USB input but did give the Aux analog input a try as well.  I did not test the subwoofer out.  Not did I play with Bluetooth.If the MX3 performs, it will be the audio miracle of modern times so let's get into measurements.  But first a note: I had to take some shortcuts to get through all of this functionality.  I think it represents the missing measurements.DAC MeasurementsThere are no line outs on the MX3 so I used the headphone output set to 2 volts to get our dashboard view:Oh no! Distortion is fairly high putting the MX3 in bottom class of all DACs tested:This is quite a bit worse than any DAC Topping has produced and will set the limit for the rest of the measurements.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our all important power versus distortion+noise at 300 ohm:The higher noise and distortion in the dashboard comes into play here putting the MX3 fair bit behind its look-alike, Topping DX3 Pro.  At 33 milliwatt power before clipping, there is not sufficient amount for a desktop amplifier.  Then again if you listen to the DX3 Pro in low gain, there is more power here than there.Using 33 ohm load we examine the current delivery of the headphone amplifier:Similar story here except 230 milliwatts is good amount of power for low impedance headphones.I was pleasantly surprised to see a very low output impedance in MX3:This means you can use any headphone with the MX3 and not have its frequency response change because of output impedance.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsOur dashboard for power amplifier calls for 5 watts of output:The amplifier is quite a bit worse than the DAC, showing a disappointing SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) of just 68 dB.  This is not performance you want to brag about to your friends:Here is the full power curve into 4 ohm load:Usually amplifiers keep reducing their THD+N as the signal gets stronger relative to noise.  Not so here.  Distortion is high enough that at just 1 watt, it starts to dominate and flattens the curve until clipping at about 30 watts.  More power can be had if you get it spike up a bit as shown so the unit meets its spec of I think 40 watts into 4 ohm.Here is the THD+N versus power versus frequency:The issue here is rising distortion in high frequencies regardless of amount of power being output.  1 kHz test tone we use in the dashboard then is almost the best case scenario.  By the way, the above test was performed with Aux input so that I could vary the input voltage as I do with other power amplifiers.Here is out signal to noise ratio:So not quite as good as CD's dynamic range.Listening TestsI only tested the headphone amplifier this way.  I will at some point start testing with speakers.With Sennheiser HD-650 high impedance headphone, there was good bit of power giving a physical sensation of bass.  Alas, by then distortion would set it and the sound would get bright and corrupted.Things changed with much lower impedance Hifiman HE-400i.  There was plenty of volume here and I had to try really hard to get it to distort.  It would do so but at levels I did not want to listen to for more than a second or two.  Bass sensation was quite good bringing the full dynamic range out of these headphones which lesser powered headphone amplifiers cannot.ConclusionsThe only bright spot in the Topping MX3 performance is its headphone amplifier especially with low impedance headphones.  Outside of that, the MX3 disappoints.  While nothing is broken and design clearly verified (Audio Precision graphs are included in the manual), the bar was set quite low to meet the price point. Is the MX3 transparent enough?  Probably for most people.  Is it transparent enough for me to recommend it?  No.  You are much better off with discrete components.  You will be paying more though to get that performance.Am I being too critical?  We had fish chips yesterday at our favorite waterfront restaurant and it cost $57 for the three of us.  Two of those meals and you can have the Topping MX3.  So the value is incredible.  Let me know what you think. \",\n",
       " ' Behringer A500 \"Reference\" Power amplifier.  I purchased this unit on suggestions from members from Amazon for just $199 including Prime shipping.Being targeted at the pro market, this is rack-mount unit with heft heatsinks on each side:Full compliment of inputs are provided from RCA to balanced XLR and TRS.  No input selector is provided though and the manual warns against simultaneous connection to more than one input.The plastic volume knobs feel cheap but otherwise, it seems to be a sturdy build.The manual says it has a class AB output stage.  I am assuming some kind of power rail voltage switching is used to keep power consumption generally low but I have not confirmed this.For my testing, I used a 4 ohm dummy load and balanced XLR inputs.  Let\\'s get into measurements and see how she did.EDIT: the first revision of this review had tested the A500 with the input switch set to bridged.  It has now been updated in proper stereo mode.MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our dashboard:Even though I was using balanced input and outputs from the amplifier, we see large contributions from noise from the power supply in the form of 120 Hz and multiple harmonics.  The harmonic distortion is quite high too with distortion spikes seemingly going on forever.  So even if the power supply was 100% quiet, it would likely still not get better distortion/sinad rating.  A dismal showing regardless, underperforming good DACs by whopping 40 db!Signal to noise ratio is rated at 100 and I get numbers reasonably close to it:Here is distortion versus power:Sad to see a class AB amp not be able to outdo the switching amp in the Topping TP60 with respect to distortion and noise where the two overlap.Thankfully the Behringer A500 has copious amount of power, producing nearly 170 watts prior to clipping.  Behringer\\'s rating is 180 watts at 1% distortion which seems like an honest rating.Frequency response is OK but not as flat as it should be for a power amp in the audible range:If there is rail supply switching, then it likely has an output filter to get rid of switching noise from that and as a result, start to roll off the response as we see above.I think we have a good picture of A500 performance so let\\'s not torture ourselves anymore.  ConclusionsWe seem to have a stream of bad luck with bargain amplifiers.  Sure, they provide exceptional value in how little they charge per watt.  I know I can\\'t make and ship the empty case of this amplifier for $199.  But still, we want good distortion specs that rise up at least to some of the worst DACs we have ever tested.  Heck, these numbers are no better than some analog formats!Given the high distortion levels and somewhat uneven frequency response, I can\\'t recommend the Behringer 500.  If you just want loud amplification, then you do have a bargain here.-----As always, any questions, concerns, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating using Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereview), or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.2164/page-3#post-59054).

       " ' (vintage?) Sunfire Cinema Grand five channel power amp designed by Bob Carver. It is on kind loan from a member. In 1996 it cost US $2,375. This unit is from 1999 and has had its caps upgraded.I can\\'t say I am a fan of this look.  The meter shows an obscure measurement of the \"power supply joules.\" The dial never moves so it is useless.Back panel shows some deviations from norm as well:In addition to normal speaker terminals, the front channels also have \"current output.\"  This just means that there is a 1 ohm resistor in series with the output.  This causes voltage/power loss that is inversely proportional to the impedance of the speaker.  As such, it varies the frequency response of the speaker so can have different tonality.There is balanced XLR input which is what I used for my testing.This amplifier is the third iteration of Bob Carver.  After leaving Phase Linear, he designed the \"Magnetic Field\" amplifier under the Carver name.  That product varies the AC duty cycle as a way to change the incoming AC voltage and with it, the output DC.  This lowers the losses in the output transistors since they don\\'t have to operate for worst case (maximum power).  See my review of Carver M-1.5t amplifier.  Bob then left and started Sunfire and with it, came this amplifier design.  Instead of crudely changing the AC duty cycle, this amplifier has a DC to DC converter which tracks the incoming music.  The higher the input level, the more it will increase its output voltage, thereby keeping the output transistors in their optimal voltage level.  Result again is very high efficiency compared to normal class AB design.  Let\\'s measure it to see how well it works.BTW, there are two versions of this: one at 200 watts and one at 400 watts.  Maybe I am going blind but I could not see any designation of such on the unit. Carver Cinema Grand Amplifier MeasurementsAs with the M-15.t, I noticed a lot of noise before I fed the unit a signal so let\\'s look at that:We see that the dc to dc converter is pass through a lot of AC noise and harmonics.  This impacts the performance of the unit:While second harmonic distortion dominates at -72 dB, the mains noise is not far behind, causing SINAD (relative sum of noise+distortion) to drop further to just 67 dB.  This is ranks pretty close to the bottom of all the amplifiers tested:SNR is not good as a result of that noise:Multitone at 5 watts suffers from both power supply spikes and high intermodulation distortion:Crosstalk is surprisingly poor:There seems to be inductive leakage at frequencies below 5 kHz which I am guessing is bleed through the shared power DC to DC converter.Oddest thing was the frequency response:There is some verbiage from Bob Carver about \"voicing\" the amplifier.  Perhaps this is intentional but then why is one channel different than the other?Claim to fame here is high power capability so let\\'s see if it delivers on that:It does indeed.  At the expense of noise and distortion but still, a 37 pound amplifier of the time, with 5 channels no less, would be in no position to produce such a power.The new DC to DC converter is regulated so no headroom power:There is healthy power at 8 ohm as well:I had to lower the input level substantially to get the amp to run the frequency dependence as it would pull back severely at higher frequencies:The lines are very high in vertical scale indicating high noise and distortion which we already know about.  What we had not seen is the difficulty the amp has with high frequencies.  This is likely due to the dc to dc converter not being able to track the voltage at higher frequencies.  Fortunately music naturally has far lower level at higher frequencies so actual impact is low.Finally, the amplifier is stable from power on:Scale is heavily exaggerated with the one channel improving just 1 dB.  And the other being stable from start.ConclusionsBob seems to have gotten the \"high order bit\" right in figuring out how to produce a high efficiency, high power amplifier.  Alas, much of the talk is about fidelity and in that department, this is a poor showing.  Mains noise gets through readily and distortion is quite high even by 1996 standards.  From buying used point of view, the cool running environment of this amp means that it ages very well so the risks are lower.  Then again that dc to dc converter brings a lot more complexity to the design.Overall, the Carver Cinema Grand is not something I would recommend.  But I can see people purchasing it as a lightweight, multichannel amplifier that delivers a lot of power.  To the extent you can purchase it for a lot less than modern class D amps, it would be a decent buy.P.S. no, I don\\'t have any more carver amps to test.    Nor did I seek them out.  They just happen to become available all around the same time.',\n",

On Amazon, it cost US $128 but the owner found it on \"Woot\" for just $70.  They are sold out there though.Not a half-bad enclosure especially for the price:It was so confusing to see dual languages on the front panel and the back:I left the bass and treble controls as you see them there.  For testing, I adjusted the gain to 29 dB which is my standard for testing.Amazon Basics 80W MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amplifier a 1 kHz tone with enough amplitude to produce 5 watts and see what we get:Well, this is not good.  Distortion (third harmonic) is quite high at around 68 dB causing the SINAD to be pretty close to the bottom of all the amps we have tested:Frequency response showed high sensitivity relative to (speaker) load:Crosstalk was horrible:How the heck they screwed this up?  The dashed line in teal is a $25 amplifier.32-tone test shows what we saw in the dashboard more or less:We can\\'t clear 16 bit content even at max power:Power curve shows early onset of distortion:At least spec is met (at 4 ohm):Sweeping with different frequencies we see distortion rises a lot with frequency:ConclusionsI am a sucker for a bargain as much as the next person.  But there comes a line that I hate to cross and this amplifier forces me to do so.  There are just so many faults here.  If you want to use it in a garage or workshop, it will be fine and run cooler than little desktop amps.  That is the only positive thing I can say about it.Needless to say, I can\\'t recommend the Amazon Basics 80 Watt amplifier.Edit: see teardown here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...azon-basics-80-watt-amplifier-teardown.20945/',\n",
       " ' OSD Nero Stream-XD analog and digital streaming (wifi and Bluetooth) amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member for testing.  It costs US $230 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  There is a bit of heft to this box considering its budget category:There is a rotary control for volume and input selection.  Naturally with no display, you don\\'t know the volume level.  Various inputs are provided although USB is for storage device, not as a DAC:I focused my testing on analog and Toslink inputs.Like the inclusion of power supply in the unit which likely is the reason for some of its weight.  In use, it got warm to touch but nothing concerning.OSD Nero Stream-XD MeasurementsLet\\'s start with using the analog input and see how it does:Well, this is not good.  There is strange/high noise floor plus plenty of distortion.  Perhaps it digitizes the analog input?  Let\\'s test Toslink then:Same bad results.    It ranks way at the bottom of our rankings:Can the news get worse?  Yes, it can:There is a subwoofer output so maybe this is someone\\'s idea of high pass filter!  I looked in the manual and there are no tone controls that could be responsible for this.Let me just post the rest of the graphs and not waste words on a failing design:ConclusionsThis is a prime example of what we in the industry call \"phoned in design.\"  You call up a shop in China, given them your wish list and out comes an amp.  You do no testing yourself and put no requirements as far as performance on the shop that is \"designing\" it.  Result is all the checklist items marketing wants with performance not even on the back of the priority list.  Does it sound better than a sound bar when paired with a couple of speakers?  Should that frequency response not screw things up too bad, maybe.  For me?  I pass and get an AVR instead.',\n",
       " ' Nubert nuConnect ampX digital integrated amplifier and wireless connector.  It was purchased by a member from the company in Germany and drop shipped to me.  The ampX costs €689 (US $766).The outside imparts confidence as far as weight and industrial design:Beauty is skin deep though.  The menu structure is very strange.  For example you hit the \"return\" button to get into options and then rotate the number to select.  Hitting return gets you back one step but never back to home menu above.  You have to select \"Volume\" and click on that to get back home.  I had the volume too high once as soon as I changed inputs and could not turn it down immediately.When you turn the unit off with the standby button on the left, a dim display remains saying ampX.  I hope that is not an OLED display or that would be burnt in after a short while.  Why do I need to see that text on the display?  The standby button already turns orange.The rear panel shows the plethora of option to feed the ampX:You have phono state, Bluetooth, and Wifi besides allt he other inputs.  What\\'s more using their app and the microphone in the phone you are supposed to be able to correct for room modes under 160 Hz (I did not test this).Audio MeasurementsI started with our usual dashboard with USB input to ampX and speaker out at 5 watts:Boy, this is not good.  We have high noise floor plus ton sand tons of harmonics and we are at just 5 watts.  I thought may be analog input would be different so tested that:It is a different sort of bad but overall in the same bucket of \"well below average:\"Signal to noise ratio is verypoor:Never seen an amplifier that doesn\\'t improve its signal to noise ratio when you turn it up.  The noise must be getting amplified proportionally with volume.32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows the same problems:Look at those spikes in mid frequencies rising to almost -50 dB.  This is where our hearing is starting to get most sensitive.Frequency response was terrible with digital or analog inputs:There is a high pass filter which I could not figure how to defeat so let it be at 10 Hz.  It must cause that terrible peaking at low frequencies.  Conversely, there is a sharp filter at 20 kHz which roll off starting even earlier.  We are down 3 dB by the time we get to 20 kHz.  And this is with digital input and sample rate of 96 kHz!Let\\'s test the power amp to full power starting at 4 ohm:That is a lot worse than a typical AVR.  Same is true with 8 ohm load:Thermal AnalysisPerformance improved a bit over half of running at 5 watts:ConclusionsI tell you: if manufacturers post measurements, I am sure they would have caught these issues themselves.  Even a marketing person would know the above frequency response would not sell a single unit.  But no.  Customers don\\'t ask for it so manufactures just throw a few numbers over the fence.  Those numbers did point to problems:We actually did better at 0.05%!  How they got this SNR, I don\\'t know :ConclusionsI get the appeal of \"do it all\" amplifier with modern streaming features.  But come on.  Let\\'s get the basics right.  The amp needs to be low noise and distortion and have flat response.  And spend some time make the unit easier to navigate.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Nubert nuConnect ampX.  It had high promise but did not remotely get there.',\n",
       " \" Fosi Audio BT10A Bluetooth Class D stereo amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The B10A seems to have just been updated with tone controls and sells for US $50 from Amazon with free prime shipping.This is a very small amplifier:You can't see the depth but it is quite shallow.  Other amps like this I have tested have complicated interface to change built-in digital tone controls.  There are none here so it was easy to use.The back connectors is identical to what you see on myriad of such amps:While the external laptop replacement power supply is large compared to the size of the unit, it is not as huge as some others.  Note that it comes with a three-prong, figure-8 AC socket so you have less options to replace the cord.I did not bother testing the Bluetooth.  I am assuming it autoselects it if in range as the priority input as there is no switch to select it.Speaker terminals are tiny of course but I managed to plug in my heavy and large banana jacks into it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain (THX recommendation):Second harmonic dominates to the tune of -65 dB which sets the SINAD to the same value.  This says that noise is not a contributor to SINAD and as such, any gain setting would have produced similar SINAD.  The 65 dB SINAD value doesn't put a smile on anyone's face but it is a couple of steps above $30 units (e.g. Lepy LP-2020A):Noise figures are barely adequate:32-tone test signal shows more or less uniform distortion at all frequencies:19+20 kHz tones shows 55 dB of distortion-free range:Their full (and unrealistic) amplitude shows higher distortions than multitone test does.Frequency response shows truncated low and high frequencies:Above with a resistor load.  Subjective the amp to my new complex speaker model of a 2-way speaker generates:The speaker model has a its impedance shooting up in high frequencies causing similar issue here.  There is a question of whether the model is similar to mass of 2-way speakers so don't run with this yet.  What you can conclude is that the speaker choice does impact the speaker response.  In audible band though, the impact is minimal and in some way is correcting the dip toward 20 kHz.  A good amp would have no speaker load dependency.Let's see how much power the BT10A can produce into 4 ohm load:At 33 watts with both channels driven this is good bit of power.  Similar story with 8 ohm load:Lack of power is by far the #1 issue in these amplifiers.  You may not be able to hear their noise and distortions but you absolutely will hear them complain when they clip.  At these power levels you should have a reasonable experience unlike some other budget amps that stop at 10 watts or so.Allowing for more distortion (1% THD+N) and testing with a short-term sinewave and long term produces identical numbers:The input power supply is regulated so there is no reservoir to provide short-term juice. Thermal StabilityPerformance gradually improved by a 2 dB or so after 30 minutes of playing at 5 watts:Above tests were performed after this warm-up period.ConclusionsThe Fosi Audio BT10A doesn't seem half bad.  I am not going to provide a verdict one way or the other.  You can decide for yourself if the performance is good enough for your application.\",\n",
       " ' Audio Research Corporation (ARC) 100.2 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 100.2 came out in year 1998 at a cost of US $2,995.  It was later raised to US $3,495.  If I remember correctly, the owner told me this the last solid state amplifier ARC produces before going to all tube route.The 100.2 is as solid as a rock:The back panel is as you expect with the exception of (custom?) speaker binding posts:In use the 100.2 cooked and cooked good.  I measured 45 to 47 degrees C on the heatsinks.  The internal temps are likely much higher.  I read that it uses unobtanium output MOSFET transistors so if they go, you likely have a giant door stop.    In use though the 100.2 did not complain one bit and ran through all of my tests.Strangely when you power the unit down, it takes it a while to do that.  What it is doing, I don\\'t know.The design of the unit is based on low feedback factor of just 6 dB.  Based on that alone I can tell you it is not going to perform well.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWe have huge power supply peaks, like due to poor power supply rejection ratio of low feedback design.  Second and third harmonic dominate the distortion profile resulting in lackluster SINAD of just 65 dB.  That lands the ARC 100.2 near the bottom of some 72 amplifiers tested so far:Frequency response is excellent:Response changes some with a simulated 2-way speaker load but nothing to cry over:Multitone test shows the high distortion products of the power supply:And rather high noise floor which we can directly measure using signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk shape is odd but not an audible concern:Amplifier Power MeasurementsThe sins of low feedback factor stare at you in the face with our 4 ohm load:Yes, distortion gradually increases but then it clips anyway.  So why not have clean power until clipping???Same deal into 8 ohms:At least it slightly exceeds its power specifications.Strangely burst power (momentary peaks) doesn\\'t generate much more power:Keeping THD+N constant at 0.1% gives us incredibly low and strange amount of power:There is so much distortion and noise in the output of this amp that you don\\'t get much power if you set your goal at 0.1% THD (likely threshold of audibility for some people).  FYI I ran the above at 0.2% THD+N (not shown) and it produced about 80 watts with a straight line.  Anyway, who says only class D amps have trouble with this test?Amplifier Thermal stabilityI powered the unit cold and let it run nearly half hour while recording distortion and noise. This is what I got:That is very high degree of improvement.  Again, low feedback means that it is more sensitive to operating temperature.  Given the high heat dissipation, it is a tough deal to have to also keep the unit on for a while to get the best performance.ConclusionsSigh.  The best analogy I can think of here is if car owners said, \"you know, a car should have more square tires\" and manufacturers running to build cars that way.  Yes, audio folklore says feedback is a bad thing.  Well, I have news for you: distortion is really, really bad thing.  As is noise.  It surely doesn\\'t give you \"blacker background\" if it has higher noise, does it?I read some place that it has less feedback so it can deliver less phase shift.  Do folks not know that you have reflections in your room, every one of which arrives at your ears with a different delay and hence phase?  That they all mix up and as a result, the brain discards that info?  If it did not, we would go crazy trying to make sense of people talking to us in indoor situations.  Anyway, we digress.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the ARC 100.2.  Serviceability will be poor and so will the performance.',\n",

My back is still complaining....There is no benefit to having a differential power amplifier but seems like they a pair of amps are used out of phase to double the power per channel:The switchmode power supply changes supply rail on (power demand) to keep power consumption low at lower power levels (\"class H\").  In my testing, the DR2 barely got warm so the mechanism is working.Emotiva XPA-DR2 MeasurementsI was expecting good measurements but instead got this:Wow, look at the harmonic spray starting at third one.  SINAD of 64 dB ranks almost at the bottom of nearly 150 amplifiers tested:Not good.Fortunately signal to noise ratio is excellent so this is a quiet amplifier:Frequency response and crosstalk are fine:Multitone test though shows the high distortion across the frequency band:The main meal here is power into 4 and 8 ohm loads versus distortion+noise:That\\'s incredible amount of power.  Alas it is delivered with lots of distortion.  Back to the power, check out the max and peak power:And this is on a shared 20 amp 120 volt outlet.  I don\\'t think we have measured any other amplifier that comes close to this level of output.Similar story holds (good and bad) for 8 ohm:As you see the curve looks nothing like other amplifiers where they are first noise limited until clipping sets in.  Here, distortion is front and center even at 50 milliwatts!We get a look at the architecture of this amplifier by sweeping power at different frequencies:We have a constant glitch around 20 to 50 watts which I am assuming is the amplifier switching rails to higher voltage.  We also have rising distortion as seen in the previous graphs even at low power.ConclusionsAssuming I don\\'t have to carry it much, I love the build and great value as far as $/watt and maximum amount of power available.  SNR is also good so you should be free of speaker hiss.  Distortion is high though and there is no getting around it.  Will you hear it?  At 60 dB it is probably borderline for most people.I can\\'t recommend the Emotiva XPA-DR2 due to its high distortion.  Otherwise, it is a very tempting package.',\n",
       " \"A member asked me a while ago to test the ultra cheap ($18) UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier on Amazon. To make the clickbait title work , I omitted the cost of the external power supply you need to bring yourself. What you get is a three board assembly:It took less than 5 minutes to put the heatsink on the main class D amp chip and sandwich the main board with the top and bottom.  The chip used must be for smart speakers as it has voice prompts when you change inputs.  Speaking of that, it has Bluetooth (which I did not test), analog and USB in.  The little heatsink has no air flow and in testing, it got quite hot to touch at times.For testing, I used my lab power supply and set the output voltage to 24 volts (max spec).  The supply has  3 Amps max current.  Amplifier is rated for dual 50 watts at that voltage input.UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier MeasurementsI started testing with analog input with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain:Considering the price, this is not half bad:I kludged up a USB type A to type A cable and ran the dashboard test again:As you see performance is not as good as analog input.  Worse yet, just a few seconds later, it lost stability and would no longer work reliably.  If I powered it down, it would work for a second or two and then go crazy again. It may be a design issue or my setup.  Either way, I could only continue with analog input testing.Noise floor is high as you can see in the FFT graphs above:Crosstalk managed to be worse than the worst I have tested so far:Multitone shows increased distortion at both ends of the spectrum:The most important test for class D amps shows strong load dependency:So the tonality you get will depend on speaker you hook up to it.As usual, we fall way short of stated power levels:8 Ohm performance was a bit better:Response vs frequency is smooth but that may be due to high noise floor which masks distortion:Amplifier Listening TestsI hooked up one channel to my Infinity Reference 253 speaker and starting to listen.  There was a lot more power than I expectedly, likely due to only having to drive one channel.  The sound was surprisingly good until you cranked it to max volume.  Speaking of which, if I paused input, the last 25% of the volume range produced tweeter hiss that was audible to about 1 meter/3 feet.I was very satisfied with subjective performance until I landed on two clips, both of which were busy with both bass and treble notes.  On these two tracks, the sound was very distorted at almost all volume levels.  High frequencies would get gritty and distorted and bass response was bad as well.  I power cycled the unit and let it cool and it seemed to play well for a couple of seconds and then would get distorted.  It may be that the crest factor is too low causing the amp to drive hard most of the time with these two tracks.  And then it overheats and distorts.ConclusionsThe first amplifier I ever built (with my brother when we were 10 or 11 years old) was this massive board and produced only 10 watts a channel.  It also cost us many months of allowance.  Compare that to this amplifier which for the price of a fast food meal for two, gives you stereo sound that most of the time is impressively good.  If it did not distort on those two channels, I would say you could build an amp with two of them and be in business.Given the distortion/heat issue, I can't recommend the UWAYKEY amplifier.\",\n",

That distortion curve is crazy.  It almost act like a tube amp or something!  Distortion is so high when it clips that when we measure at 1%, we actually get less power:Switching to 8 ohm doesn't help:Sweeping the frequencies we see this pronounced hump:So my guess is that it is a class G design but company says Class D.ConclusionsThe distortion in this amplifier is just out of control.  It is also not every powerful on a per channel basis.  So I don't see it having a good application for home use in either main or sub amplifier.  It is also expensive so I don't see the value in it either.

Likewise, having a low-pass filter (no doubt to drive subs for which they are famous), filter corner frequency and phase come in handy.  And of course the integrated volume control.  Back panel is typical with the exception of crossing terminals (for bridging):12 volt trigger is icing on the cake.Unit runs is a \"class J\" amplifier and was cool and comfortable during testing.  Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:We have massive mains spike which I could hardly reduce no matter what I did.  I am assuming it is internal leakage.

I don\\'t know anyone who is building class B audio amplifiers.Unlike some of the switching amplifiers from Crown, this is a class AB amplifier with seemingly linear power supply as it is quite heavy.  From the outside though, it look like countless other commercial amplifiers:There are two gain controls in addition to very useful clipping indicators.  Speaking of clipping, there is a compressor in there that limits power output to maximum no matter how much you increase its input.  It is a nice feature that is surely there to stop the amp from stressing while saving a speaker from blowing up due to a mistake upstream.The back panel is as you expect:In use the unit never even got warm.  I had headphones on so did not take note of when/if the fans came on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s see how the XLi 800 does in our usual dashboard at 5 watt output into 4 ohm using a 1 kHz tone:Ouch!  We have very high distortion of 0.13 to 0.16%.  The spec is 0.5% so it is within what they say but this is very high.  Translated into SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) our 57 dB value sinks into the bottom range of all amplifiers measured so far:Signal to noise ratio at 5 watt is nothing to write home about either:Frequency response is fairly flat and predictable:Power into 4 ohm relative to THD+N gives us:That is a lot of power.  And tremendous value at just 50 cents per watt. As one would predict, we lose some of that into 8 ohm:Determining maximum power and peak with 1% THD+N gives us these:We have fair bit of headroom there.I had a hard time measuring power across full spectrum at a given THD+N due to the amp limiting power (and hence distortion).  Only managed to capture 0.9% and 0.5% THD+N power here:As we would expect, we get less power at low frequencies because they tax the power supply more.  Oh, the text on graph is wrong: should say 1% not 0.1%.Finally, here is our frequency sensitivity relative to power and distortion+noise:Best distortion is usually at lower frequencies and here, the improvement is quite good at 20 Hz.  Alas, we also get less power before clipping (orange).Otherwise, the lines are quite predictable with no funny non-linearity mid span as we get with some amplifiers.ConclusionsCrown advertises the XLi 800 as a PA (Public Address) amplifier and that is what it is.  Distortion and noise is kept in check just enough to do the job with tons of power for so little money.  I suspect it is reliably too given the dual fans to keep it cool.  And the market it is being sold into.For hi-fi use, it is not something I would consider to drive full-range speakers.  For subwoofer or active woofer duty, it would be fine.As it is, I can\\'t recommend the XLi 800.',\n",

Strangely if I squint, the fuzzy picture on SMSL website shows the other power supply.As you see, you have both digital and analog inputs.  I tested both as you see below.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s start with analog input performance:Well, that is not good.  One channel is producing far more distortion.  And noise level is quite high.  Switching to USB input improves the good channel significantly:The bad channel is insisting on producing far more distortion.  Averaging the two, we get a SINAD score that is pretty much at the bottom of our rankings:From here on, I stuck with USB input since it performs better.  Frequency response was refreshingly good:Power into 4 ohm load shows poor response:Doesn\\'t get much better into 8 ohm:And we are way off the spec.  But that is typical.  Or maybe it needs the higher voltage power supply.Thermal stabilityNot much was changing after power up:ConclusionsIt is one thing to have random performance when an amp is $50 or so.

No, there is no typo in there. It weights 40 pounds/18 KG so it does have some meat to it.  You can probably see the bolt that holds the power transformer on top left. So no switching power supply at least.  Back panel shows nice sub out option:The fan is variable speed and is mostly quiet at idle.  But even under modest power it spools up as temps climb, making a slightly whining sound:The front controls are analog actually but notched, making it harder to select an exact value.  They are out of sync with each other so one notch is not the same as the other.  The displayed amount is also off by a couple of dB (27 dB shown above was actually 29 dB).  There is a built-in limiter and clipping light.Rockville RPA16 MeasurementsLet\\'s jump right in with our dashboard:That is very odd set of spikes in low frequencies.  We have the mains 60 Hz noise but also 70 Hz.  At this power level though, spray of distortion at -62 dB sets SINAD though, causing it to rank as one of the worse tested:Its score of 55 dB is so low that it pulled down our overall median by 1 dB to 78!Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts, likely due to that power supply noise.  But there is so much power that when you push it, the ratio is not bad:Multitone test shows that distortion naturally gets worse at higher frequencies:Frequency response is nice and load independent indicating a non-switching amplifier:You have a choice of two roll offs for sub output.  Strangely both boost the gain as well:Let\\'s see how accurate the power specs are (2 X 1500 watts at 4 ohm):Naturally we don\\'t get there but this is one powerful amplifier, generating nearly 1500 watts with both channels combined.Letting distortion go up and with shorter term signal we get even more of it:I don\\'t think we have measured this much power before, have we?Even at 8 ohm you have a ton of power:As noted though, noise floor is high, again, I think the worst measured.  Distortion actually doesn\\'t set in until 100+ watts.Checking for frequency vs power and distortion we see orderly response:If you are using it for sub, you want to use the above number, rather than the 1 kHz power tests shown earlier.  Fortunately this is still a ton of power considering dual channels are driven.Finally, I ran a wideband spectrum test to confirm the design is not switching:And it is not.  There is also good filtering to push the noise levels down so low above a few hundred kilohertz. ConclusionsThis is an interesting take on a pro amplifier to go with non-switching design.  This makes the amp extremely heavy compared to competition yet, the price is maintained and absurdly low.  Copious amount of power is available if you can tolerate some fan noise.Due to high level of noise I can\\'t recommend the Rockville RPA16.  But you are welcome to choose otherwise based on other factors.',\n",
       " ' Carver M-1.5t vintage stereo amplifier. It was kindly sent to me by a member.The M-1.5t came in an era where rack mounting meant serious business. As a Carver (receiver) owner myself, I remember all the advertising for the M-1.5t.  Oddly, there is no power switch anywhere:I got a chuckle seeing that monster cable tag:And found the power specs ridiculously complicated but I am sure was appreciated by the aficionadas of the amp:The front LEDs don\\'t light up until it is putting out a lot of power.  I liked the top LED which was the limiting lights and nice protection circuit which kept the unit on no matter what.  This amp was part of Carver \"Magnetic Field\" amplification line which varied the power supply voltage to substantially reduce the size and weight of the transformer.  As a result, the unit ran quite cool, maybe a bit warmer than modern class D but still, impressive for the time.The owner has replaced the capacitors in this unit.  Otherwise I think it is untouched.Carver M-1.5t MeasurementsI can see why there is no power switch as the amp did not stabilize for the 14 minutes I measured it:The level of instability is quite large, going beyond 10 db variation in SINAD!  I am used to seeing 1 or 2 dB, but nothing at this level.When I had the unit connected, and before I fed it signal, I could see constant switching noise:Not sure what that is about.  Here is our dashboard at 5 watts with 1 kHz tone:Third harmonic dominates distortion profile and with it, SINAD (relative sum of noise+distortion).  Average SINAD of 55 dB for both channels is far, far below that median for all amplifiers I have tested to date (around 79 dB).  On top of distortion, we have massive pulse train which oddly starts at 40 Hz.  So definitely not very clean.SNR though was better:Frequency response was nice, flat and extended:Crosstalk was \"OK:\"Multitone shows more than usual increase in distortion vs frequency:Front of the unit says it has low feedback which is likely responsible for this.Claim to fame is lots of power so let\\'s see how it does:We see a distinct jump in distortion at around 66 watts which must be when it switches to higher power supply voltage.  Allowing for copious amount of distortion, there is good bit of power at 273 watts.  Here is the same at 8 ohm:Now let\\'s test peak performance:There definitely is a lot of headroom, allowing power to almost double!  The 600 watt number and such must have been at higher distortion levels than what I allow.Testing for frequency sensitivity we again see the higher distortion at higher frequencies:20 Hz performance also dropped with rising distortion at just 20 watts.Finally, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:ConclusionsIt is nice to test products that were iconic during my youth with state of the art measurements that didn\\'t even exist then.  Using that, we see that in noise and distortion the M-1.5t is outgunned by vast number of amplifiers today.  However, it produces copious amount of power which would have been even more impressive then.  The efficiency rivals class D amps today which was unheard of at the time.Looking online, I see that non-upgraded but working units go for $500 or so.  They seem to be a decent alternative to pro class D amp if you have a soft spot in your heart for vintage amplifiers.  ',\n",

The SA100 costs just US $73.99 on Amazon including shipping.Form the outside the SA100 matches its sibling, the M100 DAC:Pushing the power button multiple times lets you select between Aux RCA in and Bluetooth.  Pushing and holding the volume control lets you select Bass and Treble amounts.  I was surprised that the unit had shipped with both set to max instead of zero.The volume control works well and overall, you feel like you are getting more than the $74 price indicates.Here is the back panel:An external \"laptop style\" switching supply powers the unit.  It is almost as large as the SA100 itself although not as thick.I was pleased that my rather large and unwieldy banana speakers securely mated with the jacks on the SA100.Overall, my impression is positive about the look and feel of this little, and I mean little, integrated amplifier.The heart of the unit is TPA3116D2  class-D amplifier IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect it is made for Bluetooth speakers and such.  In use the SA100 ran cool no matter how hard I pushed it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:As is typical of amplifiers with volume control, one can get slightly different results depending on how you set the input level relative to volume control on the unit itself.  The above is with volume control set to -1 I think.High distortion dominates the output resulting in one of the worst numbers we have measured with respect to SINAD (noise+distortion relative to main signal):Frequency response droops at both end some:The sharp drop after 20 kHz tells me that input is perhaps digitized to provide tone control?Signal to noise ratio \"OK\" for the class:Measuring distortion and noise relative to output power with 8 and 4 ohm gets us:Distortion sets it very early and climbs after that.  Specified power ratings are quite inflated as is typical of these chip amps.The sharp filter limit the measurement of harmonic distortion when we sweep frequency and power level:The red curve for example is for 20 kHz but since we can\\'t see any of its harmonics, it looks artificially low.Here is the spectrum of a 1 kHz tone without any kind of filter (the above had filters):Speaking of filter, even though I used an AES-17 filter to get rid of ultrasonic noise, the level was still so high as to confuse my Audio Precision analyzer.  It would often not be able to capture the input signal properly.ConclusionsIf we measured the SMSL SA100 on an absolute level, it would rank horribly of course.  But I don\\'t think that is proper here.  The SA100 costs so little and probably gets use in tertiary applications such as a workshop amp to drive cheap speakers you don\\'t mind getting stolen or destroyed.

The burgundy color is attractive as is the handle.  On the latter, the unit is very light though so the handle while handy, is not necessary to lift the thing.  Back panel shows high quality connectors:The tubes, four Tun-sol KT120, pair of 12AT7W and 12AX7 can in their original boxes for the owner installation. Went to open one of the small tube boxes but found nothing in it!  Worried, I looked around and it had come out of its box and was just floating in the larger box that they all came in.Prior to installation of tubes I had something to investigate: there was clearly something loose in there, rattling around.  So I took the back panel off to find a metal screw rolling around in there:Not sure where it was supposed to go.  There is a hole for something above the second fuse from the bottom but I think that would for a nut.I did not like lack of safety (earth) ground from the IEC terminal:Instead, there is some kind of local, star grounding referenced to neutral using a resistor.  That naturally won\\'t work for safety purposes.  With that power supply board mounted vertically with voltages as high as 300+ volts, I sure as heck would want this metal case grounded.  I don\\'t care what audio/electrical problem they were trying to solve there.  I want a safe product first and foremost.  Naturally there is no safety/regulatory certification which I expect a company with the name \"Carver\" to be able to afford.I got a kick out of the beefy speaker terminals but ultra-thin wires leading to it!  Yes, the lengths are short and at this wattage is probably fine but from \"optics\" point of view, you would want to use something better than hair thin wiring (see gray and red wires).I was sad to see the VU meter glued to the case:I realize welding a couple of threaded stand-offs to the case costs money but at this price, I expect such.  The meter is not backlit which was another disappointment.  But was useful for checking bias which was right at the spec at 100 milliamps.So nice looks but under the skin, a number of concerns.Carver Crimson 275 MeasurementsI usually let amplifiers warm up some and watch their behavior and also let things stabilize before measurements.  Manual states that bias can be checked after 20 minutes so I let it run for that long and a bit more:Note that the vertical scale is only 3 dB so don\\'t be alarmed by the variations.  Generally speaking, unit is table after a couple of minutes of warm up. But it is fascinating to see performance gradually get worse as it kept warming up (again, at micro level).So next comes our usual dashboard.  My Audio Precision analyzer by default has floating (non-earth connected) RCA terminals.  But I had to override that by grounding it as I observed oscillations (frequent occurrence with some amplifiers).  No other attempt at grounding made a difference in power supply/mains hum:The power supply noise really dirties up the FFT spectrum but looking past that, we see that the low SINAD (sum of noise and distortion) is dominated by distortion.  Unlike the common reputation for tubes, distortion is third harmonic for the most part, not second.  Naturally the high level of distortion places the 275 very low in our scale, second only to one other amp ever tested:Company spec is quite good for noise level relative to full power.  I could not get that without a-weighting:But applying the a-weighting filter and with it, getting rid of power supply noise, we do essentially get there:Crosstalk was poor:Frequency response has an odd shape and good bit of loss at high frequencies with 4 ohm load:Output impedance is high enough that is combining with the load to change the high frequency roll off.  Things get better as such with an 8 ohm load:There is an RC filter on the speaker terminals.  Wonder if that is what is providing the roll off.Using 32 tones to simulate \"music\" we see a high level of \"grass\" which would obscure any low level detail:Notice how the worse performance is in low frequencies.There has been controversy regarding ability of the 275 to produce its rated power of 75 watts so let\\'s start with 4 ohm load as I usually do:The amplifier produced 29 watts after which it blew its 3 amp mains fuse.  Fortunately two spares were provided, allowing me to continue testing.  Company specs distortion at \"less than 1%\" so let\\'s see power at that rating:Very dramatic difference between 1 or 2 second power (used for left side) vs short bursts.  There is clearly a capacity problem to produce sustained power.  Note that this is at 1 kHz as is industry convention.  Note that allowing just 1% THD reduces the power even more than what I allowed in my power sweep.I was surprised to not see selectable output impedance for 8 ohm load so proceed with the test as is:We blew the second fuse but now power is much more healthy at 60 watts.Hoping to not blow the last fuse, I kept the max power level lower as I changed frequencies:Performance was \"reasonable\" (for at tube) but once we got down to 20 Hz, it became super erratic and blew the third fuse.   It produced only 14 wats which is well short of 30 watts it produced at higher frequencies.  I would have wanted to test at more frequencies but it was past midnight and I did not feel like hunting around to find my own replacement fuses.ConclusionsAs a Carver owner of 40 years (solid state), I have a soft spot for the designer.  Alas, while I like some things about this amp like the nice looking paint, I am very disappointed in the QC and construction of the unit with respect to safety.  Loose screws and glued meters should not be part of a nears $3,000 amplifier.  Measured performance is awful of course and one would expect that for many audiophile tube amps.  But having third harmonic be dominant blows away the story of why that is audibly a good thing.  Clearly the specifications of the amplifier is incorrect for 4 ohm load (company even allows usage for 2 ohm loads!).  And low frequency behavior is very poor.Unless you are going to buy the Carver Crimson 275 to just look at it, I can\\'t recommend it for many reasons stated above.  I expect more from the man, the legend....P.S. It was nice to take a break from drying up our flooded home and get back to some \"normalcy\" with testing this amp.  It cheered me up to be \"working\" again and doing what I enjoy.EDIT: We have had two formal responses from Bob Carver:Carver Crimson 275 Review (Tube Amp)What baffles me is that to make this amp safe and hum free doesn’t take much effort.

       " ' Carver Raven 350 tube monoblock amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and (I think) costs US $4,750.The 350 is not a bad looking amp. It has the same \"orange peel\" paint job of the previous Carver 275 amplifier I reviewed.  At 42 pounds, the unit is pretty heavy.  With all the weight in the back, the front handle is kind of useless when it comes to lifting it.There is an XLR input but I believe it is for convenience and performs the same as RCA. I measured the DC resistance of the 4 and 8 ohm terminals (after the measurements) and realized they are both the same!  Here I was switching back and forth between them.   Anyway, measured DC resistance is 0.47 ohm. The 1-2 ohm tap has a lower DC resistance of about 0.3 ohm.Unlike the 275 amplifier, the fuses did not blow and the amp survived my sweep tests.  Bias is to be set at \"80\" on the front dial and that was the case when I powered on the unit.There is a gain control but you are advised to set it to max which is what I did for testing.There is a flip switch in the front which changes the amount of feedback.  I tested the amp in both settings.Here are the specs:Carver 350 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with high-feedback performance using XLR input:There is copious amount of distortion causing SINAD to be dominated by it.  At 44.1, it ranks as the second worst amplifier ever tested:It even performed worse than the Carver 275 which had a SINAD of 46.  Switching to lower feedback doesn\\'t make things that much worse:Note that gain is reduced and therefore, volume will be different. This makes AB testing tricky.  Here is a more detailed FFT showing the small difference between low and high feedback:Notice how distortion is made up of both 2nd and 3rd harmonics so you can\\'t make the argument that it is \"2nd harmonic goodness.\"As noted, RCA performance is the same as XLR:Power supply 60 Hz noise in both cases causes severe intermodulation higher up in frequency. No amount of grounding impacted that so it is endemic tot he design.Noise performance is decent for type of amp it is:Intermodulation distortion rears its ugly head again in multitone test:I don\\'t know how anyone could hear more \"detail\" with such an amp where so much of the music signal will get lost in the distortion \"grass.\"Frequency response should be flat but it is not:It naturally will have load dependency due to output impedance.Let\\'s see the power situation as we had serious shortfall in the 275 amp:We don\\'t meet the spec there but come closer with 8 ohm:Back to 4 ohm, here is our 1% THD (double the company spec) max and burst power:We seem to get the same shortfall.  There is momentary reservoir though allowing the peak output to shoot way up.  This was not always consistent though.I also tested 2 ohm capability:You are still current limited so no more power.Changing the test frequency gives us the following power curves:There is some instability at 20 Hz and fairly significant power drop.  This points to power supply not having enough capacity as the lower frequency taxes it for longer period.  Some drop occurs in every amplifier by the way so it is a matter of how much.Finally, the amplifier warms up quickly and is pretty stable:Testing occurred after this warm up.ConclusionsWhat an upside down the world of audio is. Folks want to pay so much more to get dirtier sound.  You want dirty?  The Carver 350 gives it to you. Even at 5 watts there is copious amount of harmonic distortion.  Power supply mixes with that at such high level that it creates its own spread of distortion. A video must come with these amps that hypnotizes you into thinking you are getting great sound....I can\\'t recommend the Carver 350 monoblock amplifier.',\n",
       " ' Pass ACA Class A stereo power amplifier.  It is a DIY design by the famous designer, Nelson Pass, meant to be starter amplifier for people new to audio electronics to build.  There are many kits available. The one loaned to me from a long time friend of the forum.  The kit seems to cost around US $320 or so.The ACA sample I received comes in an attractive black case:The design is a Mosfet output stage with a single stage buffer.  Very modest level of feedback (9 dB?) is provided to keep distortion somewhat under control.  As you will see, the gain is very low requiring full 2 volt of DACs to drive it to max power.Here is the back side:I did not mess with it but I am assuming the single XLR allows bridged mono operation.Power is provided by a very beefy external switching power supply which outputs 24 volts with up to 5 amps or 120 watts.  All of that is put to \"use\" in generating copious amount of heat.  I was told by the owner to let it warm up for a few minutes.  As you will see in the measurements, this actually made the performance worse, not better.Overall, this is a very nice package if it performs.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard with 5 watt output into 4 ohm.  Normally this is well below the max power but not in this case as we see later:Gosh... What happened to aiming for high fidelity?  This is a distortion-factory if there ever was one.  The notion that it is mostly second harmonic does not hold true either.  Welcome to the bottom of our amplifier ratings:Let\\'s dig into distortion spectrum at lower power level of just 1 watt:Second harmonic is more dominant than at 5 watt but it doesn\\'t stay there that long.  Here it is at 2 watts:Our 32-tone signal resembling \"music\" paints an ugly picture as a result:I was pleasantly surprised how quiet the unit is though:Frequency response is also very well extended:You may be able to make an AM radio out of this thing.  Back to ugliness, here is our power versus distortion+noise into 8 ohm load:Oh gosh again.... Only 7 watts of power with SINAD of 38 dB?Things don\\'t get much better with 4 ohm load:We now have distortion climbing into near 10% category at max power of just 7.4 watts/channel.There was little variation of response with respect to frequency:Distortion level is so high that it is masking secondary sources of it.Making sure this unit matches the reference, I compared them to what Nelson Pass has published:We are getting very good agreement.  So this is what the unit is supposed to do.  Nelson stays with 1 watt output which shows the performance to be better.EDIT: I noted on the dashboard that the gain was much lower than the spec.  I am told that version 1.6 which I tested now has a spec of 10 dB for gain so we are good.EDIT 2: See this link for bridged mode measurements: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...ass-a-power-amplifier-review.9741/post-262036Listening TestsIs this thing on?  That is the expression that immediately came to mind after I hooked up the ACA amp to my Sonus Faber Concertino bookshelf speaker. Granted, the Concertino is spec\\'ed at 86 dB efficiency but come on, I could barely hear it.  There was no bass naturally. But not much above that either.  And this was with my Topping DX3 Pro at full volume.For grins, I plugged the US $74 tiny little SMSL SA100 Amplifier which I recently reviewed  into the setup.  Now the speakers came alive, with lots of bass, great dynamic range, and detail.  Yes, the amp started to cry when I turned it up much but until that point, it left the ACA so far in the dust it was not even funny.ConclusionsAs a starter hobby amplifier to get some sound coming out of a speaker, with relatively few components, the Pass ACA Class A Amp does the job.  Build it, have fun with it and then put it aside and get a proper amplifier.  Amplifiers need to have a lot more power.  And much less distortion.  We are not even close here folks.Do I need to tell you that I can\\'t recommend the Pass ACA for hi-fi listening?  I hope not.']"

       "[\" Topping LA90 Discrete balanced stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $799.The case is the same as the IC-based Topping LA90 which is fine with me given its high quality look and feel.  The power switch doubles as input selector once the unit is on.  Volume control can be bypassed using switch in the back:As before, power is provided by a hefty, 64 volt switching power supply rated at 4 amps (likely provides higher current in short bursts).  The amplifier as you see is all balanced with three inputs.  You have a selection of low and high gains (although the latter should really be called medium gain).  It can be bridged and nicely tolerates even 4 ohm loads in that mode.  Trigger is provided to enable one power switch to turn on a series of devices.Note that this is a traditional amplifier and not class D.  There is no remote so if you need that, you have to use a DAC/pre-amp with that capability.Topping LA90 Discrete MeasurementsThere is a lot to measure here given the fact that we have dual gains and bridge mode.  Let's work our way through it starting with low gain in stereo mode:Incredibly, the LA90 Discrete matches the performance of its IC based unit, landing on its perch on top of all other amplifiers ever tested:Switching to high gain costs you a few dBs but you are still ahead the competition:So feel free to use this mode.  Noise performance continues to be superb:Frequency response is flat of course and load independent:Crosstalk is better than average amplifier but is a step down from the regular LA90:Multitone showcases the superbly low distortion levels:Let's see how we are doing in power department starting with 4 ohms:We wind up good bit more power at 70 watts (vs 56 watts for normal LA90) while giving up nothing in spectacular noise and distortion department.  Allowing for more distortion gets us more power:8 Ohm performance follows the same path:Tests so far have been at 1 kHz (other than multitone) so let's vary that and see what happens:In a word, wow!  The amplifier simply doesn't care what frequency you throw out it!  This is a quite a step ahead of normal LA90 which itself was state of the art.Power on is silent but off may create a faint noise depending on your speaker sensitivity:Warm up showed one channel struggling a bit but later I found the power connector not fully tight so maybe that was the cause:Regardless, it behaved correctly after a minute.Topping LA90 Discrete Bridged MeasurementsAs with normal LA90, bridge mode still provides superb performance:The name of the game is power though so let's see what we get into 4 ohm:Notice how we get more power but distortion is nowhere to be found until we clip.Wow!  This makes a great case for using a pair of these amps.  You get so much power out of each one, rivalling much larger amplifiers.Reactive Load TestingThe LA90 has a very sharp clipping point.  This means that it goes from vanishingly low distortion to full clipping.  Combine this with aggressive protection circuit which shuts the unit off and you have the make up of a system that can't be measured in batch mode as my Powercube setup uses.  If I set the voltage for 8 ohm load, then it causes the amp to shut down when driven at 4 ohm.  Good news is that the amplifier doesn't care about reactive loads.  Here are the results for 8 ohm for example:Code:Maximum Output4/11/202312:13 AMMaximum Output Level ResultsSelected Load    Ch1 (Vrms)    Ch2 (Vrms)    8 Ohm; 60 deg Capacitive    21.2    21.3    8 Ohm; 30 deg Capacitive    21.1    21.2    8 Ohm; 0 deg Resistive    21.0    21.0    8 Ohm; 30 deg Inductive    20.2    20.3    8 Ohm; 60 deg Inductive    20.9    21.0I could not get a similar output at 4 ohm due to limitation of the instrumentation as stated above.  But if I drove the parameters manually, I could get it to tolerate reactive loads just as well.Selecting 2 ohm caused the protection circuit to kick in.  I didn't have time to mess with that.I spent nearly 2 hours trying to get this test done with the amplifier being pushed to clipping and shut down probably 50 to 100 times.  Even though the case got pretty warm, the amp continued to function without complaining. ConclusionsTraditionally in high-end audio when a company says they are using discrete designs, I get prepared for bad performance.  Topping once again proves that this is no barrier for their designers.  The discreate LA90 not only matches the exemplary performance of the IC based LA90, but betters it in power handling, producing more power (a needed feature).  Pushing noise and distortion down in our top tier performance is very hard but Topping has no problem maintaining its significant lead over even best of the best amplifiers.  Their skills and execution in this regard leaves me speechless.Needless to say, it is my absolute pleasure to add Topping LA90 Discrete to my recommended list.  Today is a happy day!  P.S.  Power amplifiers are least reliable audio products (due to high currents and voltages involved).  New designs sometimes need to prove themselves in this regard.  So if you are risk averse, please don't be the first to purchase this amplifier.\",\n",
       " ' Topping LA90 integrated amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $800.I must say, this is one interesting industrial design. Everything oozes style despite the diminutive package.  This aspect continues in the operation of the unit with the sound of the relays solidly clicking indicating something good is going to happen.  Here is the side view:While quite solid, you can pick it up with one hand.  The small size is aided by a massive external switching power supply:Here are its ratings:Back to the unit, you can see three balanced inputs.  Volume control can be bypassed although I did not do so for my testing. You can also operate LA90 in bridged mono mode.  There is also 12 volt trigger.There are to gain settings.  One at 10 dB and another at 20 dB (nominal).Topping LA90 MeasurementsThese are non-bridged mode measurements.  Bridged setup follows this section.  Let\\'s start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm in low gain mode:I don\\'t need to tell you that this is a stunning level of achievement.  We have a power amplifier producing almost the same SINAD as a state of the art DAC!  Using this number, LA90 grabs the top spot with ease with a nice gap to boot:Here it is zoomed:You might be thinking that it can only do so with low gain but that is not true.  Even in high gain performance is spectacular:It would still achieve top spot in our rankings and achieve full audible transparency.Not only is distortion vanishingly low, so is noise level:Frequency response is flat and wide as expected:Being class AB design, it has no load dependency.Crosstalk is incredibly good although it loses a tiny bit relative to last champ of amplifiers:Multitone test shows the very low distortion levels:Let\\'s see how much power we have:So power is modest in non-bridged mode.  But note how good the high gain mode is so I would feel just fine using that for operation of the unit if you need to.  Allowing distortion to rise to 1% naturally gets us more power:Here is 8 ohm:Oops.  \"High Power\" should be \"High Gain.\"Changing frequencies shows the same excellent performance:Despite being pushed deep into clipping, the amplifier did not complain until I got to 20 Hz where its over temperature shut it down.Finally, you don\\'t need any warm up:Topping LA90 Bridged Mode PerformanceA shorting wire is provided to connect the two negative speaker bindings together allowing bridged mode from the top two posts.  Here is our dashboard again:Performance is still exceptional.  Here is our SNR:Due to more power available now, we cross the amazing 140 dB SNR threshold.  What this says is that even if you play at 140 dB, the noise level will be at or below threshold of hearing!  Of course there is not enough power there to do that but basically you know that noise is not part of the equation with LA90 as even 5 watt measurement hits below threshold of hearing.We want to know the power increase though so here it is (with 8 ohm which is the minimum impedance):Now we get good bit of power at 95 watts with almost no penalty relative to non-bridged mode.  Notice the massive gap as far as noise floor relative to Purifi amplifier.Allowing for 1% distortion we get:Here is the super wideband spectrum of the amplifier while producing 5 watts:Edit:Power Tests at 2 Ohm (Stereo) and 4 Ohm (Bridged)Requests were made to test the amplifier beyond its minimum load impedance specs.  Let\\'s start with 2 ohm load while driving one channel in stereo mode.  Dashboard still shows superb performance:Let\\'s now sweep the power:You don\\'t get extra power relative to 4 ohm but the amplifier was stable and did not even go into protection. Now let\\'s switch to Bridged mode (both amplifiers driven in differential mono) and run our power sweep again:Now we see the amplifier \"doubling down\" producing nearly 200 watts into 4 ohm.  Again, the amplifier was well composed and kept driving into clipping region without complaining, or shutting down.Again, the above tests are beyond the amplifier specifications and tests I never run as such.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping engineers are bringing their expertise in designing ultra low noise and distortion in headphone amplification to power amplifiers.  As such, they have outdone every amplifier I have measured in that regard, getting ahead to capture the #1 position with a large gap to #2 choice.The amplifier is not for everyone though. Power level is modest as compared to competitors.  And you have that large external power supply.  My wish is another version of this amp with built-in power supply, motorized volume control with bridge mode standard.  For now, we need to celebrate one of the most important development in delivering transparent, high fidelity amplification to audiophiles in a very attractive package.It is my absolute pleasure to recommend the Topping LA90.  History is made on this day folks!',\n",
       " ' Hypex NCx500 NCOREx reference design amplifier. It was sent by the company and kindly assembled by our local expert, @Rick Sykora.As you see the sample is a \"monoblock\" configuration (one channel) driven by Hypex SMPS1200 switching power supply.  The only other board is the Ncore standard interface board.   The gain as set is almost 12 dB.  EDIT: see follow up below review for with buffer (27 dB gain) performance.Here is a close up:Note that this board includes a pre-amp (buffer).  I am testing per above in unbuffered mode.During use the amplifier as a whole was extremely stable and never changed its temperature, nor did it go into protection mode.  A sole XLR connection is the input to the unit.  All fits in this nice compact box.Hypex NCx500 Buffer Bypass Amplifier MeasurementsI let the unit warm up for a while but was not needed as it was stable as soon as powered up:It did reach a plateau around 11 minutes though as you see.  But note that the vertical scale is 0.1 dB.Now on to our dashboard of 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Distortion is provably inaudible at -120 dB.  A bit of noise sags that down to 113 dB which is still superb performance, landing it at #2 best amplifier every tested:Noise performance is exceptional:Even when listening to 16 bit content at 5 watts, you have an extra 10 dB of noise margin!  This is one quiet amplifier.Frequency response is wide and load invariant which is a great attribute not existing in all class D designs:Multitone test shows off its low distortion yet again:I must say, I was not prepared for the amp to beat the reference Benchmark AHB2 in noise level in our power test:EDIT: I re-ran the power sweeps again with tighter load terminals which resulted in much lower distortion levels especially at 4 ohm:Despite massive amount of power the NCx500 produces, its distortion is now close to the best we have ever measured!I updated these max and peak measurements again which produced more power:Company specs this power level even at 2 ohm so I tested that:This is one powerful amplifier!Here is our updated 8 ohm power:I was surprised how much lower its noise level is compared to Purifi 1ET400A reference design.  Maybe that amp was not running at such a low gain setting though (edit: correct).  Still, this is once again superb performance.Sweeping with different frequencies we see various distortion mechanisms kicking in (edit: now updated showing much less distortion):There is some rise in distortion with frequency but this is to be expected.Finally, here is the pop on and off noises.  Keep in mind that this is a reference design and the on/off switch turns the whole unit on and on as opposed to soft power:Hypex NCx500 Buffered MeasurementsAs noted, there is integrated buffer (pre-amp) in this module.  I activated it which boosted the gain to 27 dB.  Maximum power is now achieved at around 2.2 volts which is well within the output of many well designed DACs using balanced out.  Here is our new dashboard:Distortion has gone down a bit but we have picked up a bit of power supply noise.  Despite that hit, performance is still state of the art:As noted, SNR has gone down but still excellent:Multitone is mostly the same but impacted by the power supply noise:Frequency response is the same:As noted distortion is lower:On/Off noise is impacted a bit:ConclusionsHypex amplifiers have always enjoyed great performance in our testing.  It is wonderful to see the company innovating and increasing the performance of their high power NC500 platform.  You no longer have to compromise between available power and superb technical performance.  You can have both.It is my pleasure to recommend the Hypex NCx500 OEM amplifier module.  Cant\\' wait to see it show up in commercial designs.',\n",
       " \" Hypex Nilai500DIY class D amplifier module with PS500DIY power supply. Parts were provided by the company and member @Rick Sykora was kind enough to assemble it:As indicated, the single channel amplifier is on the left and the power supply on the right. The amplifier has built-in preamp providing three levels of gain (12, 22 and 28 dB). A jumper selects the appropriate level.  At 12 dB, you need about 12 volts to reach full power which requires a pro audio interface or a pre-amp with that level of output.  The sole input in this configuration is balanced.In use the amplifier was exceptionally solid even when pushed hard.  It kept going and stayed very cool.  It is rated to 2 ohm (see measurements below).Edit: in the original review I had the top open so I could change the gain settings.  Alas, it turns out that doing so allowed some noise pick up around 10 kHz.  I re-tested with the lid closed and that issue went away.  As a results, we have slightly better performance especially in high-gain.Hypex Nilai500DIY MeasurementsLet's start with lowest gain setting:That is superb performance with distortion at or below -140 dB!  Here is the response at higher grain settings:With all thee gain settings, the amp lands in our top 20 best amplifiers ever reviewed based on combined noise and distortion rating (SINAD):Noise performance is excellent but just shy of state of the art:But gets there at full power:As we expect from Hypex, frequency response is load impedance independent:Multitone performance is excellent:Amplifier is stable on power up:Let's look at available power at 4 ohm:Looks like we no longer have to decided between superbly low noise and distortion and available power!  State of the art performance is once again achieved in low gain while still producing lots of power (342 watts).  Allowing distortion to climb to 1% naturally gives us more power (and matches company spec):We still have healthy power even with 8 ohm load:Since the amp is rated at 2 ohm, I measured that as well:There is a bit of penalty but still great performance.  Seems power supply is limiting power so you don't get more juice.I was a bit surprised at the ballooning of the distortion at higher frequencies:EDIT:There is more of a noticeable pop on power off than power on:As requested, here is the switching response:ConclusionsIt is clear Hypex is taking competition in class D amplifiers seriously responding with a DIY friend amplifier solution that has a ton of power and wonderful performance.  While we could nitpick here and there, but in the larger context of the amplifiers out there, this is a superb offering of great performance and lots and lots of power.FYI I don't have pricing for the kit.  If someone has it, please post.  I see online ads saying around $900 to $1,100 for a single channel.I am happy to add Hypex Nilai500DIY amplifier and its companion PS500DIY power supply to my recommended list.\",\n",
       " ' Benchmark AHB2 Amplifier using THX technology to reduce distortion.  I was going to request one for testing due to membership demand but to my pleasant surprise, the company volunteered to contact me and send not one, but two units!  I requested the second one because of something  I was seeing in the measurements that turned out to be my issue, not the amp\\'s.  The AHB2 retails for US $2,999 from the company direct.The AHB2 is a very compact form factor, enabled by use of switching power supply to increase efficiency/density:There is just a power switch in the front.  It might be but I constantly reached for the screw next to it to power it on!  Having the power switch be slightly different color or shape may help with this.There are a set of LEDs that show the status of the amplifier.  They are driven by an FPGA (field programmable digital logic) that monitors all aspects of the amplifier and shuts down the unit if stressed.  It did so very quickly and efficiently in my testing.  Usually this is done with purely analog or maybe a small microprocessor.  As such, the coverage of scenarios that could damage the amplifier is much less complete than using the approach Benchmark is using in AHB2.Here is the back panel:This is a very minimalistic approach given the small amount of real estate available.  Only input is XLR balanced which is just fine in my book.  A gain switch allows the input level to be controlled so that you can just use an RCA to XLR adapter and still get full power (2 volt max in high gain).  At the other extreme, the low gain setting is designed for professional pre-amps with lots of output, getting its max power at 9.8 volts.  Using this scheme, the signal to noise ratio can be improved as you will see in measurements later.For speaker terminals there are two sets: classic heavy duty banana jacks and SpeakOn.  The SpeakOn are locking and provide the best performance.  I lost about 3 dB of performance using the banana jacks due to less secure connect there.  So the measurements you see are with SpeakOn jacks.Another minor nit on that note: I had a rather cheap SpeakOn cable and its plug was just large enough to hit the silver screws that the sockets are mounted with.  Typical round shaped SpeakOn ones are not an issue.  Flush mount screws would solve this problem.There is a switch for selecting stereo or mono bridged output.  The latter quadruples the amount of power available and unlike typical bridging, according to Benchmark comes at no penalty in distortion!  I plan to test this later as it has a minimum impedance of 6 ohm so I could not use the 4 ohm setup I used for this testing.There is a very beefy AC mains cable with really nice locking tabs.  Insert it and it stays put unless you push the two red tabs on each side.  Nothing is more aggravating than the AC cable coming half-way lose from the IEC socket.Being a proper company of course the AHB2 comes with full set of regulatory/safety/emissions certifications which is super important with power amplifiers given the high voltages and currents running around in them.In use the AHB2 stays very cool for a power amplifier when it is idling, outputting little power which was a nice surprise.As to THX technology, it merges a low-power but very low distortion amplifier with a high power but higher distortion amplifier.  The distortion of the latter is not seen because it is producing so much power (so the ratio of distortion is lower).  The general scheme is not new, dating back to 1980s but new implementation is.  We have seen this in stellar performance of Massdrop THX AAA 789 amplifier which broke new ground in level of distortion and noise. Will the Benchmark AHB2 manage the same?  Let\\'s see.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my 5 watt output test using 4 ohm load using SpeakOn terminals as noted:I hope your jaw is on the floor just like mine was when I saw this picture emerge!    113 dB THD+N in a power amplifier?  Are you kidding me?Look at the harmonic distortion.  The worst case spike is below -130 dB!  This is insanely good.  Of course this type of SINAD (signal and noise ratio) crowns the Benchmark AHB2 as the best I have ever tested:The performance was so good I literally had to rebuild my dummy load to get there.  Even the quality of the metal used in the connectors matters to get to this level of distortion.  I replace all my dummy loads with higher precision ones that have much less VCR (voltage coefficient of resistance).  Resistor values can become voltage dependent creating distortions of their own.  Up to about 105 dB of THD+N, it doesn\\'t matter but beyond that, the VCR was the dominant distortion, not the Benchmark AHB2 amplifier!It was requested that I show the breakdown and distortion so here we are:Our best case hearing threshold is -116 dB SPL so no question that this level of distortion is totally inaudible.  Separating the noise from THD, we see that it is noise that we are measuring as THD+N, rather than distortion:And this is with exceptional noise performance of Benchmark AHB2 as we see in the graph of THD+N versus power:Even in high gain, the AHB2 easily outperforms the DIY Hypex NC400 I had tested before which used to be the best amp I had tested.We have 185 watts of power at incredibly low distortion of 0.00016%, besting the company specifications.Note that the FPGA protection mode kicks in and essentially shots the amplifier down past the limit.  You get absolutely distortion-less and noiseless performance until there is no more.EDIT: here is performance in bridged mode using same 4 ohm load:You get 500 watts of stunningly clean power.  Protection circuit shut the unit down after that so it is quite safe to try.  With a THD essentially matching the non-bridged mode, there is no reason to be afraid of trying this.Intermodulation distortion versus power level shows the same story of clean power:If you want to know what you get for extra money over bargain amplifiers, you can see the difference in the above graph.  We are not talking about 5 to 10 dB but whopping 40 dB better!I have had requests for intermodulation distortion using dual 19 and 20 kHz tones.  Here is that:THD+N versus output level looks far cleaner than anything I have tested before:Even at the limit of our hearing (20 kHz), we have vanishingly low amount of distortion.  The graph is exaggerated so shows a rise there but in absolute levels, despite 90 kHz bandwidth of the test, we have incredibly low THD+N of just .004%.The sharp spike at 45 Hz in green shows the amplifier going into protection mode.  So don\\'t pump that sine wave continuously into it at 133 watts.  Frequency response is exceptional too as expected:Since this is not a switching amplifier, there is no filter there allowing the bandwidth to go to 200 kHz and beyond.  Lowest band of AM radio is 450 kHz so likely you could use the AHB2 for an AM radio transmitter!  Usually when we test switching amplifiers we see all kind of \"interesting\" things in their outputs above hearing range.  The AHB2 is a classic configuration albeit, with a switching power supply so all is well and clean here:My reference graph for the Hypex NC400 used an AES filter (by accident) so I ran the AHB2 both ways, with or without that filter.  Using the filter (in green) so the two are equal, we see much cleaner spectrum below 200 kHz and of course, no massive switching spikes.  Worst case spike is below -115 dB.  In other words, the Benchmark AHB2 is clean even in the areas you are not looking!  It is like a restaurant scrubbing their parking lot with soap and pad as well as their dishes.  My loose wires on dummy loads is not the best setup for measuring crosstalk but here it is anyway:Where our hearing is most sensitive (2 to 5 kHz), separation is around 100 dB which is way, way more than we need.  Despite the small enclosure, the AHB2 manages exceptional numbers here.EDIT: forgot to run the classic SNR test in the original review:Wow, assuming you play at peak of 120 dBSPL, your noise floor will be at -10 dBSPL!  That is absolute silence.ConclusionsIt goes without saying that the Benchmark AHB2 breaks new ground with respect to performance of power amplifiers.  Using it, you can be assured that any distortion that you hear is from other sources (speaker, source, content, etc.).  This is what I look for in high-end audio: absolutely the best performance so no second guessing is involved. You buy once, and you are happy forever!All of this comes from a company that is a model of transparency with proper and accurate measurements of their products on their site.  And importantly, volunteering to have that data shown to be correct by independent sources such as us.  Support form the company for me at least has also been exceptional.Yes, $3,000 is fair bit of money but is pocket change in high-end audio.  Sales tax is higher than $3,000 for most of those products!  I hear a lot of talk from audiophiles to have the equipment get out of the way of enjoying the music.  Well the Benchmark AHB2 at levels that assuredly passes full transparency.  So if that is your moto, you better stop buying boutique products with no specs and independent measurements and get an AHB2.  Everything you hear then will be what is in your source, not the dirty dishes that your amp my serve your food on.Needless to say, the Benchmark AHB2 gets my strongest recommendation for power amplifier.  The pink panther agrees, having hit the ball out of the park after I took that shot!',\n",
       " \" Audiophonics HPA-S400ET. It was sent to me by the company after member request and costs 1 490,00 € (US $1,638).I must say this is one of the best packaging of class D amplifiers (Purifi in this case) that I have seen!  It is slick and has style.  While the heatsink on one side is cosmetic, the other is connected to the power supply power transistors although in use nothing rose above room temperature.  Back panel shows extremely high quality speaker connections:You can see it better with the lid open:I must say, this is so clean you can eat of of it!    I simply cannot find any fault with the assembly and design.  Bottom to modules are Purifi 1ET400A modules fed by their own custom buffer/pre-amp gain stage.  Jumpers let you select from different settings (see measurement section).Audiophonics HPA-S400ET MeasurementsGiven the three different gain stages, it was a challenge to decide what to test so that this job doesn't become nearly infinite in scope.  I will first show you the dashboard for all three gains starting from high gain:This is superb performance already with distortion products at -125 dB.  Channel matching is excellent.  Here is medium gain petformance:This is a nice setting as max power is achieved at 4 volts meaning you can use all of our modern/desktop amps to drive the unit and gain a bit of performance.If you have a pro interface that goes up to 10 volts out, you can utilize the low gain mode:This gain is actually close to how I measured our two top performers (Benchmark AHB2 and Topping PA5) so let's see how the Audiophonics ranks:Looking at top 20 we see:Amazing performance!  Measuring SNR at low and medium gain we get:OK, from here on I am going to stick with low gain mode.  Here is our multitone:Stellar as expected.  Crosstalk manages to actually land in #1 position of any amplifier tested:Frequency response is dead flat with no load dependency:Let's sweep and see how we do with 4 ohm load:Excellent performance.  Here is how much power we get if we allow more distortion:Switching to 8 ohm we see that the performance actually exceeds than of Purifi (although I think that was tested at higher gain):Testing at other frequencies we still have great performance:Finally, the amplifier is stable at power up so no need to wait for it to warm up:ConclusionsThe Audiophonics HPA-S400ET comes in a beautiful package with super performance to match its good looks. Yes, it builds on Purifi's excellent platform but they managed to add value without messing with its performance.  The gain settings are well thought through.  The whole thing is so well executed and must be a delight to our European members who can buy it locally.  Having been built in France, it is also a feather in the cap of our French members.  I am happy to give my strongest recommendation to Audiophonics HPA-S400ET.  You have a lot of power with superb fidelity and transparency.Edit: video review just posted:\",\n",
       " ' TP (Topping) RA3 stereo balanced rackmount amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $229.Yes, this is a new sub-brand from Topping.  I quite like it.  The large and highly visible volume level is as gorgeous to look at as it is responsive.  A remote control is provided which is something you don\\'t usually get.  The remote (or front panel) allow you to select between RCA and XLR input:For those of us who have a DAC and an analog source, this is all that we need.Lots of nice touches are there such as independent memory for the volume setting for RCA vs XLR.  Safe volume settings.  Trigger support and ability to update firmware in the future.  Love that despite low cost, the power supply is built in.  You have a hard power switch which puts the unit in standby.  Push the volume knob or the remote button and it powers on.This line of products, at least for now, will be sold by Topping direct.  Alas, it is not yet on the website so you may have to wait a bit to order it.I don\\'t know anything about the design but based on measurements below, it seems to be a highly optimized class D chip architecture.TP RA3 Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Distortion is kept below threshold of audibility at around -116 dB.  So noise is the only thing we need to worry about.  There, when combined with distortion, nicely lands RA3 in our top 20 best amplifiers ever tested:Mind you, noise performance is excellent:Survey of available music indicates best case dynamic range of 18 bits and TP RA3 gives you that at just 5 watts!  Allow it to go to its max power and it reaches 20 bits.Multitone showcases the very low distortion in mid frequencies where our hearing is most sensitive:But if you insist on pumping ear deafening high frequency tones into it in the form of 19 and 20 kHz tones, you naturally get more distortion:A concern with low cost class D amp ICs is load (speaker) dependency.  Topping has worked hard to make that basically a non-issue:Crosstalk is incredibly good, besting even our reference:Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm:As noted, measurements completely match Topping spec of 130 watts at 1% THD+N.  Not boundless power but very good for many.  Naturally we lose good bit of power if you have a rare 8 ohm speaker:Varying the frequency we do see the class D chip amp create more distortion above 5 kHz or so:There is a bit of a noise spike with power off:There is some inconsequential spikes in one channel in the first short minutes as the amplifier warms up:Speaking of that, the amplifier didn\\'t feel to be rising above room temperature in my testing -- on top anyway.Finally, here is the efficiency vs output power (per channel -- both channels driven):Idle power while on is about 9 watts. The protection circuit is aggressive in the way it shuts the unit down when pushed hard so I did not try to run my reactive load tests.ConclusionsIt is remarkable to me how Topping is not only capable of producing new product one after the other, they do so while striving for state of the art in performance.  This is so even though they are bound by the capabilities of the class D chip amplifier they are using.  I really like the larger form factor as it not only allows better dissipation of heat and inclusion of AC power supply, but also makes the unit more substantial and \"professional looking.\"  If they made the rack ears optional, they would fit nicely in a home system as well.Feature set is great for this class of product with inclusion of remote control, trigger support, nice and visible volume level, etc.It is my pleasure to add TP RA3 to my recommended list.  Incredible performance for so little money. ',\n",
       " ' Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp with the optional Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage.  With that option, the cost is £1,979.00 excluding VAT.  This translates into US $2,554.  The unit was purchased new and drop shipped to me by a kind member.  I had previously measured the reference design from Purifi so will be good to see how this version rates with a different input stage.The Nord dual monoblock comes in a very attractive enclosure (most of which is not visible in this image):Efficiency of class D amplifiers and switchmode power supply enables such slim case to be used.  There are two rows of heatsinks on the sides but they are decorative for the most part.  I will do a teardown separately.  For now, the amplifiers dissipate heat into the bottom of the chassis and dual power supplies have their own heatsinks inside the box.The back panel shows seriously beefy and nice feeling speaker connectors:When I received the unit, it immediately shut down.  The reason was a blown fuse.  I replaced it with a spare that comes in the IEC holder.  That worked for all but my last test which is the strenuous power vs frequency.  I have let Colin know that I think the fuse amperage needs to be increased given our low operating voltage in US.  Note that with music you are not going to hit this easily so it is more of an issue of lab/stress testing.  I don\\'t have a higher amp fuse to try with it until a batch arrives on Monday.  The fuse is the smaller 5x25mm which I only have a few of in low amperage (usually are used in multimeters and such).Edit: turns out the fuse that was sent for was for 240 volt countries.  A \"slo-blow\" 10 amp replacement fuse was sent and worked fine.Other than this, the amplifier was solid in its performance never shutting down or complaining.  The enclosure didn\\'t even get warmer than room temperature.  Inclusion of two power supplies here relieves my worry of a the power supply being the weak link, not the amplifier.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 Ohm at 1 kHz:This is right on the money as far as THD+N and hence SINAD:Which is great news of course.Noise performance also matched the Purifi reference design:We have a very low distortion and very low noise floor.  This is all that you would want to ask an amplifier.  That, and power so let\\'s see how it does there:Dual power supplies don\\'t give you more power as we are essentially matching the reference design with one power supply.I was surprised to see a rise in distortion with one channel worse than the other.  Is this the Sonic Imagery 990Enh gain stage in play or were we given better evaluation samples at announcement?  We won\\'t know until we test another amp that uses Purifi gain stage.Same issue exists at 8 ohm although not as exaggerated:This makes me think the issue may be in the amplifier.Note that this is not an audible concern so don\\'t jump off the cliff please.  We see an exaggerated version of the same in intermodulation distortion relative to input level:Frequency response is flat and similar to reference design:Sweeps of power versus frequency gives us varying curves (ideal = all curves on top of each other):We see that at 20 Hz where we need most power, we have least amount of it.  This is typical of amplifiers since 20 Hz tone changes slowly not giving a chance for power supply capacitors to recharge between cycles.Finally here is the 19+20 kHz at the same 5 watt power of Purifi reference design:The pair around the main tone are identical to reference design.  Noise floor is a hair higher but that is probably run to run variation.ConclusionsThe Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amp is an attractive build of the Purifi class D amplifier technology.  The dual mono configuration raises the price fair but but my belief is that it will last a lot longer than the single power supply version.  Measured performance is just a bit worse than Purifi reference design as power increases beyond 25 watts or so.  Not an audible difference but would be good to figure out where this is coming from.  I can\\'t detect any improvement from Sonic Imagery discrete 990enh opamps.  So personally I would go with the stock gain stage and save enough money for a night out alone.I am happy to recommend the Nord Three SE 1ET400A Dual Mono Stereo Amplifier.  It builds on state-of-the-art Purifi amplifier modules and delivers it in nice packaging.',\n",
       " ' Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  With the options as tested, the cost is US $4,212.  As the name indicates, the amp is based on Hypex NC1200 class D amplifiers plus some value add in the form of Sonic Imagery 990Enh buffers, very fancy speaker terminals and even directional fuse from Synergistic Research!The enclosure is the same elegant design I have tested before with Purifi modules:And here is the back panel connectivity:The massive speaker terminals had no trouble handling my heavy speaker wires.The trigger input is unusual in that it is supposed to fully shut of the unit, consuming no power (?).  The amps are mounted to the bottom of the case as is typically down.  So the top got slightly warm in testing.  The bottom though was rather toasty after stress testing.  I will post a teardown later.In use, the NC1200DM never complained, shut down, or go into protection.  Even during my intensive power versus frequency that causes weaker designs to bail out, the NC1200DM cruised right on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard at 5 watts into 4 Ohms:Channel matching is quite good.Highest distortion is third harmonic at around -108 dB which mostly responsible for 105 dB of SINAD (signal relative to sum of distortions and noise).  This puts the NC1200DM near the top of our rankings:Signal to noise ratio was quite good especially near max power:32-tone signal resembling \"music\" shows exceptionally low intermodulation distortion in audible band:Most meaningful test is power versus distortion and noise so let\\'s get into that with 4 ohm load:We clock nearly 500 watts before the clipping onset.  Hypex rates the module at 700 watts which is likely at higher distortion levels (see later).  Distortion rises fairly early relative to our reference.I was surprised to once again see how quiet the NC1200DM was when testing at 8 ohms and comparing to Purifi 1ET400A reference design:Power output leaves 1ET400A behind at 270+ watts.  The cost is higher distortion.Keeping THD+N at 0.1% and sweeping the frequency we get:Now we peak at 600 watts.  Drop at low frequencies where we need power is slight (10% or so).  The sudden drop at 20 kHz is usually due to ultrasonic noise shaping and wide bandwidth of this test (90 kHz).  In real use, we don\\'t need much power at 20 kHz and at any rate, a lot more would be produced than this chart indicates.Here is the intermodulation distortion for 19+20 kHz tones for those of you who love this graph: Remember that the threshold of hearing is quite high at 19 and 20 khz even for people with healthy response up to these levels.  And at any rate, music never has full amplitude signals at these levels.Crosstalk performance was very good, stopping just short of our reference:ConclusionsThe Nord One NC1200M Signature Edition produces tons and tons of clean power with very low noise floor.  While other amps have tested with lower distortion, none come to its power output.  Audiophiles routinely underestimate how much power they need.  As such, it is great to see an amplifier produce so much power while keeping distortion and noise at bay.  I see no performance flaws anywhere.Yes, the \"signature\" components are of dubious value but they are not hurting things either.The enclosure is attractive.  And the whole package light and efficient.  My kind of design. I am happy to give a strong recommendation to the Nord One NC1200DM Signature Stereo Amp.',\n",
       " \" VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp (buffer/input gain stage).  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,090.  I just reviewed the same amp but with SIL 994EnH-Ticha Pro buffer so you can compare them. As with the other variation, I am a fan of the more slim rack mount case (it is a lot deeper than this photo shows):Back panel as expected:VTV Purifi class-D amplifier with the optional Weiss OP2-BA Op-amp MeasurementsLet's start with our dashboard and see if the power supply noise we had with the SIL buffer also exists here thereby telling us if the problem was that or something else:Sadly the issue remains with the noise in the FFT spectrum.  So something else is at play.  I tried to mess with grounding to see if it impacts it and it would get much worse.  At one point one channel got unstable producing variable output.  Maybe that was instrumentation error but I did not walk away with a good feeling on this.  Nevertheless, overall ranking remains quite high due to stellar performance of Purifi amplifier module itself:I am just going to post the rest of the measurements without text as they are similar as the other review:When I ran the dashboard and saw the same problems with the other VTV amplifier, I wanted to rule out instrumentation error.  So I dug up my Purifi reference design and it produced superbly clean output as it did in my original review.  While I was at it, I also ran this test (which sadly I over-wrote) and it produced similar output to this VTV amplifier.  So the choice of buffer doesn't have much impact here:ConclusionsWhen I bought my latest car, it came with a fine scratch on the instrumentation cluster cover.  Too lazy to take it back to be repaired.  To this day it bothers me when I see it even though it doesn't impact anything on the operation of the car.  Such is the case with this VTV Purifi amplifiers.  In absolute terms they land way on top of the class.  But looking carefully we see that something in the assembly and layout has caused performance to degrade objectively.  It won't impact you in any way listening to it but just like my car, it shouldn't be there.  Smaller companies building these boxes don't do any measurements and hence can't spot problems like this.  So it is partly understandable but as consumers, we get to be ruthless in our demand in best in class execution.  So I hope the company looks to resolve these problems as their prices are very attractive otherwise.I can't recommend the VTV Purifi amplifiers based on these two versions I have tested.\",\n",
       " 'The design of the Vera Audio P150/600 RS is complete. The price is 29 600 NOK exclusive tax and shipping. Due to the corona situation and a delay with chassises, it will be a while before we have a decent number in quantity. We only have a few for sales at the moment and that\\'s the reason it hasn\\'t been announced yet. But I thought I would share some details for those who have an interest.In 4 Ohm it delivers 1kW with amazingly low 0.0006% THD+N. This is bridged, but it says a lot about the performance. The \"notches\" you see in the graph below comes from our measuring equipment switching measuring area and isn\\'t able to keep up with such low numbers. The actual distortion around 50-500W is even lower. Probably down towards 0.00025%.In stereo mode it gives out 290W in 4 Ohm with the same low distortion:The linearity is also in it\\'s own class. +/- 0.025dB from 20Hz to 20kHz. -3dB at 60kHz.The noise as low as 17uV (A-weigthing):CMRR.This is something we have spent a lot of resources on. Briefly said, CMRR is the the amplifiers ability to supress noise that comes from the outside through cables. Everything over 100dB is considered expectionally good.Here\\'s the measurement of the gain adjustments. This is also something we have spent a lot of time on to get accurate.You can see that the maximum deviation is 0.01dBThe chassis of the amplifier is cut out from a whole block of aluminium and there are no visible screws or seams. It\\'s of very high quality and part of the reason our amplifier cost what it does besides extremely accurate gain adjustments, bridging option, etc.Some more info from our enigneer Armand:* We use a huge power supply of 3kW. This has plenty more capacity and runs cooler at heavy loads. It will also result in much lower distortion at low frequencies (at high loads)* Our amplifier is (as far as we know) the only Purifi model that has bridging capability. A lot of testing has been done and special considerations are in place to make this work as it should. Looking at the measurements of 1kW with 0,0006% distortion proves this is flawless.* We deliver real measurements of the whole amplifier from input to output measured with a R&S Audio analyzer.  The noise, THD+N and power delivery presented by others on specification sheets are in several cases only copied from the Purifi 1ET400A datasheet and do not tell the whole story. Internal layout, audio buffer, power supply, cooling capacity all play a role into the final result.* We use a microcontroller that constantly monitors the 1ET400A modules. Temperatures, voltages, overcurrent, clipping, error modes, etc. The RGB LED on the front will warn the user if the amplifier operates outside safe limits. Clipping is warned with RED/GREEN blinks depending on Left/Right channel. Sustained overcurrent will shut down the amplifier in order to avoid damage to speakers and warn the user with steady RED light. A yellow light will warn the user that the temperature is reaching a level that is not healthy.* We have a Auto OFF function. 3 hours without signal on the inputs will initiate a shutdown of the amplifier to conserve power and longevity of the product . (This function can be disabled by the user if not wanted)* There is a trigger input. (This automatically overrides the Auto OFF function)* All small signal levels are contained inside a well shielded small compartment in the back, ensuring low noise and excellent RF protection. The RF protection is done directly at the back of the fully shielded Neutrik XLR inputs. The XLR inputs are directly connected to the chassis to ensure short signal patc to ground.* Remote sensing of the amplifier feedback loop at the speaker terminals using a four wire system ensures the lowest possible output impedance and distortion at the terminals.Here is a picture of the internal layout. Note that this is seen from the bottom with the bottom lid off.',\n",

See: you may recall from my review of Tom\\'s headphone amplifier, Neurochrome designs strive for very low distortion and good, objective performance.  So I have been quite excited and anxious to measure one of Tom\\'s power amplifiers.From the outside, the Modulus-286 is rather small but very chunky look with massive heatsinks (for its size) on each side of the unit:The heart of Modulus-286 and other solid state amplifiers Tom designs are the integrated LM3886 IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect this is from the National Semiconductor team though which was acquired by TI.The LM3886 is a pretty powerful little IC capable of producing about 70 watts at 4 ohm.  The Modulus-286 uses a pair of them to get over 100 watts of power at the same rating for each channel.  Typical of mass market amplifier ICs though, the distortion rating is nothing to write home about at 0.02% (SINAD of 71 dB).  In Tom\\'s design, an active feedback loop (i.e. uses an op-amp) brings this distortion way down as you will see in the measurements.The LM3886 is a class AB amplifier unlike other products we have tested that use much more efficient class D.  So while the LM3886 by itself is small, it requires pretty large heatsinks to cool it which is the reason for them being included in Modulus-286.  But in addition to the amplifier circuit, another source of size, weight and some heat is the power supply.  Here, Modulus-286 deviates from classic class AB designs by using a switching power supply to gain its size and weight advantage.  You can see it in the center of the Modulus-286:It is a commercial switching supply which Tom says has been customized for his use.The amplifier modules are actually hard to see on each side of the central power supply.  I tried to take a picture of them but it was hard:You can see the two LM3886 ICs mounted to the heatsink at the bottom.  I am sure there are better pictures at Tom\\'s website.So let\\'s get into the measurements and see how she does.MeasurementsAs usual, I start with my dashboard view with 5 watts of output and in this case, XLR balanced inputs:SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) breaks the 100 dB barrier which is nice.  You can see that the distortion of 0.0009% is orders of magnitude better than the specified level by TI (although that number is likely at higher powers).I noticed a lot more mains/power supply noise in one channel than the other.  Nothing I did would impact its level.  I could also feel the \"tingling\" sensation from the case which indicates mains leakage.  This is legal and safe (allowed in safety standards) but does explain the elevated levels there.  Of course at -110 dB is not audible since our hearing is so poor in low frequencies.Next, I measured the all important power versus distortion+noise:Compared to our best measured so far, Hypex NC400, the Modulus-286 nearly matches it in noise level.  On distortion, one channel also tracks the NC400 until its max power of 95 watts.  This was with 0.975 millivolts of input.  Attempting to feed it strong signal would cause it to go into protection so I could not quite get to the specified power rating.One channel deviates some though as you see in light red.  the better channel goes as low at 0.0007% of THD+N or SINAD of 103.  Seeing how this is at max power, it is very nice figure to arrive at.  Performance is basically noise dominated with no distortion until the shut down.The Hypex DIY NC400 has more power but its distortion starts to rise from where Modulus-286 stops.  It produces 226 watts at the point I have marked in blue.  So it has more headroom.Frequency response shows somewhat early roll off:We are down 0.4 dB at 20 kHz.  Would have been nice to see this flatter seeing how this is a traditional class AB design.  Likely it is part of the computation to keep the amplifier stable with different loads.  Of course not an audible concern for most of us who can\\'t even hear 20 kHz let alone 0.4 dB of drop in there.  Signal to noise ratio is quite good:Broadband spectrum analysis to 1 MHz shows very little of concern:We see some indication of the switching frequency of the power supply around 160 kHz but its level is quite low at nearly -100 dB.  With class D amplifiers we see levels as high as -30 dB!  Note that since this is a class AB amplifier, I did NOT use my AES-17 filter with any of the tests.I tested THD+N versus frequency at 6 different power levels as you see on the graph:As expected, distortion rises at higher frequencies (feedback gain is lowest there).  At 97 watts, the Modulus-286 could produce frequencies above 1 kHz but below that, it would enter into protection mode as indicated by vertical lines in orange.At the lowest power level (0.25 watt) we are dominated by noise and hence the elevated line in red for that.  That is true of any power amplifier.Finally here is the crosstalk for one channel (the other is better):Please take this as worst case response.  I am testing the amp using a bunch of wires everywhere which can impact crosstalk (and noise levels at low amplification).  I need to build a dedicated module with tight wiring for tests like this.  Regardless, numbers like this are amply good enough as far as audibility is concerned.ConclusionsThe Neurochrome delivers good power with very low distortion using a combination of active feedback and off-the-shelf amplifier IC.  Use of a switching power supply keeps costs, size and weight down.  It produces nearly 100 watts of very clean power into 4 ohm load.  Personally I like to have much more power than that.    But if you have subwoofers, or don\\'t listen as loud and/or have more efficient loudspeakers, you should be fine.I am not sure what value judgement to put on the amplifier.  Certainly at $1,300, the Modulus-286 amplifier is \"cheap\" compared to any high-end amplification.  At the other externe, the DIY Hypex NC400 I tested produced more power at I think $1,500.  Purchasing the Neurochrome Modulus-286 would let you support a smart, Canadian designer and entrepreneur.  I let you decide how valuable that is.Overall, I can recommend the Neurochrome Modulus-286 as a well-engineered product with no design faults.',\n",
       " ' NAD M27 7-channel surround audio amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Seems like the M27 came out back in 2014 and costs US $4,400.The M27 has the same design language as the excellent M17 Home Theater Processor (looks only):The enclosure, especially the top surfaces, oozes quality and luxury in the way that many high-end audio companies fail at.  And the looks are actually functional with ample ventilation holes for proper cooling.  I will do a teardown later to show this in more detail.One strange bit of functionality is that the NAD logo lights up orange but goes off when the amplifier is turned on using the touch button on top.  This is backwards but fits the functionality for home theater use in darkened room.The rear panel takes the high quality look of the front and top to the back:Everything from XLR connectors to speaker terminals is stout and feels solid.In use, the amplifier when driven in two channel mode, never came remotely close to complaining, shutting down, etc. which I frequently see in AVRs.Heat dissipation at first is very modest but after half hour of use, the idle power consumption of the rest of the unused channels served to warm up the top.  No worries though as it was not remotely \"hot.\"  This is due to use of switching power supply (single one powering all the channels) and class D amplifiers based on design from Hypex nCore series.  The actual implementation is custom which I will show in teardown.For my testing, I focused on XLR input only.  I hope if you buy an amplifier of this class, that is the connection you use.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard, driving two channels into 4 ohm at 5 watts:Ah, what a relief it is to see excellent SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) in home theater space after testing so many subpar amplifiers in AVRs.  Distortion products are around -110 dB.  Ironically, this is far better than the processor and AVR DACs we have tested.  In 2-channel world, our desktop class are usually way ahead of amplifiers but not in home theater.  So far anyway.The very nice showing in noise and distortion puts the M27 amplifier near top of the class:Spectrum of 1 kHz FFT shows the typical switching frequency in 400+ kHz:Here is the frequency response:There is a kink in there around 50 kHz but seeing how it is way out there as far as audiblity, it should be OK.  May differ though with a real speaker load.Crosstalk is very good:Dynamic range at around rated power is excellent (better than 20 bits in digital terms):Even at rated power you have 105 dB or 17.5 bits.Most important test is THD+N (distortion+noise) relative to power level as we increase input.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Wow, this is one powerful beast in stereo mode.  Courtesy of a power supply that is designed to feed 7 channels, it is not a bottleneck in 2-channel mode allowing these class d modules to sing.  And sing loud!8 Ohm output is also quite good:Of course in neither case we are able to match the state-of-the-art 2-channel amplifiers from likes of Benchmark or Purifi.  But what is there at -90 dB or better should be quite excellent.Peak power as you can imagine, is even higher:Here is a refined version of a recent test: I sweep for power using different frequencies from 20 kHz on down to just 20 Hz.  Test bandwidth is 45 kHz so that it allows enough harmonics to be included in the test but not too much that it just shows ultrasonic noise-shaping and such:As expected, at low frequencies we have lowest distortion (lowest graphs) but we clip due to much larger power demand of these \"slow\" waves.ConclusionsThe NAD M27 surround power amplifier has exceptional looks and build quality.  It is beautiful to look at.  That beauty runs way deep into its veins, producing lots of power in a class-leading way.  Efficiency of class-d power amplifier and switching power supplies serve to keep the unit quite cool for its power rating and number of channels.  Great attention has gone into heat management and signal flow -- something I don\\'t normally see in DIY hypex ncore builds.Yes, at US $4,400 it is not cheap but you are getting 7 channels of amplifications.  That is roughly $630/channel which is actually quite competitive.I am happy to give the NAD M27 one of my highest recommendations.If you have a home theater and want a gorgeous, powerful and performant multi-channel amplifier, your search is over.  Get the M27 and worry about money for food later.',\n",
       " \"This is a write-up and detailed measurements of the March Audio P122 class D Hypex based stereo power amplifier.  It was sent to me by the company (@March Audio).  The P122 costs US $750. Due to my relationship with company owner, I won't be performing a review or providing a recommendation one way or the other.  So don't look for panthers on pictures either.The P122 uses similar packaging to the rest of March Audio products:There is just a touch button that turns the unit on and off (really on and standby).The back panel has very nice and really long speaker terminals:In use, the P122 never complained or get warm.  It passed all the tests without going into protection mode.Power supply is switching as noted on the unit so works as is worldwide.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:As noted on the THD+N panel, performance is roughly the same as the spec in one channel and slightly better in the other.  Distortion and noise combined is near top of class:Signal to noise ratio is excellent:Crosstalk is respectable as well:Frequency response is good but not flat out to infinity as some amps are:Multitone test shows a few odd spikes in mid frequencies:But levels are nearly 100 dB down so not a cause for concern.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet's start with 4 ohm:We are a bit shy of the specification on power but distortion and noise is much better than typical mass market product.  Same is true of 8 ohm load:Not sure what explains the shortfall in power. These amplifiers have regulated switching power supplies so usually don't produce more power than continuous:ConclusionsWhile the power level is on the low side, the performance is much better than typical brand name amplifiers.\",\n",
       " ' ATI AT522NC Stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 522NC costs US $2,195 but I see it on Amazon for US $1,995.  The AT522NC is part of a series which starts with 2 channels of class D amplification and goes up to 4 channels in the same enclosure.The industrial design of the AT522NC has some unique touches, some of which work, some that don\\'t:The part that detracts is ironically the ATI logo.The power button has a very nice feel and gives one impression of quality.Looking at the back, I was surprised by choice of input power connection:It is a 20 amp IEC connection rather than the most common, 15 amp variety.  This is partially due to use of linear power supply and massive/heavy toroidal transformer.  But the most common reason is that the same setup is used in higher channel count amplification.The amplifier is on a vertically mounted hypex NC-500 class D amplifiers with their own heatsinks.  The \"motherboard\" has the power supply components.  Overall, it seems like a very neat and logical design.The speaker connections are of course very secure and high quality as can be expected in this price range.  Great to see balanced XLR inputs which is how I tested the unit.In use, there was barely a heat rise in the enclosure and the unit never shut down or complain even in the face of severe clipping.   The large feet allow better convection cooling which is appreciated.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone, at 5 watt into a 4 ohm load:The use of linear power supply has its price in the form of power supply spurious tones (60, 18, 300 Hz, etc.).  The dominant distortion peak is third harmonic at a bit less than 100 dB.  Add some noise to it and SINAD (THD+N inverted) becomes around 98 dB.  This places the ATI522NC well above average of all the amplifiers we have tested:It sits just to the level of NC500 from Nord.  Those of you who keep track of such things , I am sure will compare and contrast how it does relative to other Hypex based implementations.Signal to noise ratio is good reaching excellence at full power:Frequency response is orderly for a class D amplifier which needs an output filter to truncate switching frequency:32-tone source trying to simulate \"music\" shows very low levels of intermodulation distortion:But for a peak at 60 Hz (typo in the graph), the distortion-free range is 110 dB or about 18 bits.Crosstalk is also very good:Most important data is power into 4 and 8 ohm versus distortion and noise.  So let\\'s start with 4 ohm:So not class leading but low distortion while providing 300 or so watts before sudden rise in distortion.  Spec is higher but one can have more data points at the limit and gradually walk up the curve, and hence squeeze out a few more watts.  I will show this later.For 4 ohm load, here is the comparison to our state-of-the-art in class D amplification in the form of Purifi reference design:Purifi maintains the lead in distortion but produces a bit less power.I was able to run my tough test of THD+N at 0.1% versus frequencies.  Some amplifiers have died trying to run this test.  Others are had to poinpoint as their distortion jumps all over the place:We see that at 1 kHz we normally measure, power is almost near max.  Above that we reach nearly 360 watts.  At 20 kHz though, distortion shoots way up and we are able to only produce 22 watts before THD+N of 0.1% is hit.  Fortunately there is not much music energy there so practical audible concern is low.I made a survey of a few of the tracks in my music library.  Peak energy seems to hover around 40 Hz.  For that reason, I have started to measure amount of power at 40 Hz and here, we have 316 watts which is good.Finishing off, switching frequency is around 400 kHz:The noise doesn\\'t scale with power though.  Plotting the same at max power with source frequency of 40 Hz gives us this:And intermodulation distortion using 19+20 kHz at 5 watts output into 4 ohm:ConclusionsThe ATI AT522NC seems like a solidly built amplifier based on Hypex NC500 modules.  ATI builds amplifiers for many other companies and this competence shows up in this review.  Performance is of course limited by what the NC500 module can do.  Use of linear power supply defeats the size and weight advantages of common class D amplifiers.  It may provide better peak power rating -- something I wanted to test but forgot.  Overall, I can recommend the ATI AT522NC stereo amplifier.',\n",
       " ' NAD M28 Multichannel amplifier based on Purifi Eigentakt technology.  It was kindly purchased by a member from a local dealer (Gig Harbor Audio) and sent to me for testing.  The M28 costs US $4999 through its dealers.As with the M27 amplifier I reviewed, the M28 comes in the same gorgeous industrial design:At nearly 50 pounds, this is a heavy amplifier likely due to the weight of the enclosure as the class D amplifiers and it switching power supply are light.The one thing I am not a fan of is the touch on/off button on top.  It is not responsive.  I wish the NAD logo was a hard switch.The back panel shows how you do a first class job of termination:I have kind permission from the owner for a teardown so look for that soon.EDIT: Tear down is now here: MeasurementsThe Purifi 1ET400A that the NAD is based on scored a SINAD (sum of distortion and noise) of 104 dB.  Let\\'s see we get that from M28:Oh no!!!  Distortion has risen by 15 dB but thankfully it is below threshold of audibility.  Noise however, has degraded fair bit, sinking SINAD by the tune of 6 dB.  There is also good bit of variability with the SINAD measurement constantly changing 1 dB or more.  As it is, the M28 slips in performance even relative to last year\\'s M27:For a clue of what may have happened we can look at the amplifier gain which is now at 29 dB versus reference design\\'s 27 dB.  Given the anemic output of AV products from their pre-outs, I can see why NAD opted to do this but whatever the reason, noise performance has suffered.  We can clearly see this in signal to noise ratio:As noted, we have dropped 5 dB in noise performance which more or less explains the similar drop in SINAD.  This is a shame as noise can be audible unlike low levels of distortion.  Fortunately we still clear my hurdle of 96 dB for 16 bit content even at 5 watts so practical consequence will be small.Before someone asks, here is the dashboard with RCA:Thankfully performance is similar.Frequency response is good and matches the reference design:Crosstalk performance was superb:You buy a power amplifier for \"wattage\" so let\\'s see how the M28 performs into 4 ohm load:Gosh, not only do we have higher noise level but also much higher (in relative terms) distortion as power output increases relative to reference design.  I did not want to believe this so to confirm my setup, I pulled the reference design and measured it again and its performance was unchanged (green).  So this is definitely a degradation in M28 design.We can see similar issue with IMD intermodulation test:Fortunately as noted, we do get more power than the reference design which was likely limited by its power supply.Letting distortion climb up to 1% produces more power naturally:Interesting to see that burst power is actually a bit lower!  The test attempts to change output power until it achieves 1% THD+N and it must have reached that at that lower power.  I wonder if the sudden burst on the input increases distortion a bit.  It is an engineering curiosity than anything else.Switching to 8 ohm load we get:We again have lower performance compared to reference but the gap is lower.With AVRs, we see power reducing as we increase the number of channels.  Not here:This is excellent and shows the value of high efficiency amplification and power supply.Sweeping at different frequencies shows some small oddities but nothing of major concern:Note that our normal testing for power per industry standard uses 1 kHz but the most need is at lower frequencies.  For that reason, I have started to annotate power at 20 Hz as seen above.  All amplifiers I have tested reduce their power at low frequencies.EDIT: per request here is multitone test:ConclusionsWithout context, the NAD M28 would get very high praise from me.  Alas, taking a reference design and reducing its performance is not going to put me in that mood.  This is the cost of manufacturers not providing detailed specifications/measurements like I am providing.  If they had done that, their marketing department would immediately see that they have taken a step back and push engineering to do better. In absence of that, the \"Eigentakt\" label is plastered in the marketing material and celebration begins.What NAD has done is taken a superior amplifier design and brought its performance below that of older Hypex technology.  And charge $600 more for the privilege.  Not right.On the glass half full side of the argument, this is a beautiful amplifier, superbly crafted with excellent performance and tons of power.  I looked and could not find any M27 for sale anyway so M28 it is.I am going to of course put the M28 on my recommended list.  Just no celebration.  NAD, you could have done better.',\n",
       " ' Buckeye Hypex NC502MP 8-channel class D amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $2,295.There is not a whole lot to look at here.  Sheet metal is rather thin and fitment not that great.  So put it in a cabinet and forget about it.  The backside shows the expected including trigger control to sequence powering up multiple units with one stroke:I was surprised by the weight of the amplifier. Mind you, it is far lighter than a class AB amplifier but it is still not light.  The reason for that is that each amplifier module has a large vertical heatsink with quite stout mounting bracket tying it to the chassis.If you are not familiar with Hypex NC502MP, it is an all-in-one high power stereo amplifier with on-board switching power supply and input buffer.  Supply the connectors and you have a complete amplifier.  In this case, four such modules are included to get to 8 channel.  Due to large amount of power these amplifiers can produce in tandem, dual AC inputs are provided.  The amplifiers are split between the two AC inputs.  If you don\\'t need continuous power, you can connect both inputs to the same power strip which is how I tested it.Buckeye Hypex NC502MP Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard by measuring one amplifier module\\'s dual outputs:Performance is very good as we expect from Hypex modules.  A minor issue was the power supply spikes in one channel (blue). I tested all the amplifier modules and they all do the same thing.  So likely is due to leakage from the onboard power supply bleeding into the more adjacent channel on NC502MP.  Using the \"good\" channel on each board removes that bit of bleeding:Using the former SINAD for ranking, the amplifier nicely lands in our \"excellent\" bucket:Here is all of them in that category:Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and changing the load has no impact on output:Multitone shows the superb performance, albeit somewhat worsened by the less good channel:Noise performance is extremely good:My target is 96 dB at 5 watts which the Buckeye nicely exceeds.  And provides full transparency up to reference level of 120 dBSPL.Crosstalk naturally is beyond approach if you use two separate modules but even in the same module, it is excellent:Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm using channels in the same module or two separate ones:As you see, there is no difference.  You are only limited by how much AC power you have as power supplies are not shared.Max and peak power is impressive:We are talking nearly 1.3 Kilowatts in stereo!  Needless to say, if you are going to have all 8 channels whaling, you better have good amount of current on dual AC lines.  And make an appointment at your ear, nose and throat doctor because hearing damage is most likely!Measuring response at 8 ohm gave me a really hard time:Reason being that online specs from Hypex does not show that hump from 10 to 100 watts at all.  I tried everything from testing my instrumentation to measuring every amplifier module and still got the same results.  I shared the graph with Buckeye only to be told there is updated measurements from Hypex showing the same hump.    While performance is superb up to about 8 watts, I wish that the hump wasn\\'t so pronounced.I was most impressed by the ability of these modules to drive down to 2 ohms with both capacitive and inductive loads:It produces the same 53 volts no matter what!  At 1 ohm though, it instantly went into protection but recovered very quickly.This is one powerful and robust amplifier!Finally, you don\\'t really need to warm it up:FYI, I left the unit on overnight and in the morning, the top was warm especially in the center.  All the amps combined, do generate some amount of heat so best to not leave it on if you don\\'t need it and provide good ventilation.ConclusionsThe Buckeye NC502MP is a perfect amplifier for home theater duty. It provides incredible amount of power from each module to drive even the most inefficient speakers to ear piercing levels.  It does so with extremely low noise and excellent distortion at modest levels.  At higher powers, distortion does climb.  While I wish this was lower, I don\\'t think there is an issue at all for home theater applications.  Even with music, I think you will be fine but the purist may want to have better.  Then again, if you are going to lose power to get there, this amplifier may be a better choice.I am going to put the Buckeye NC502MP 8-channel amplifier on my recommended list.EDIT: teardown now posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?reviews/',\n",
       " \" Buckeye Hypex NC502MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased and drop shipped to me by our dear moderator, @AdamG247.  I don't know what it costs.Not sure what there is to say about the case:Or the back panel:Other than the fact that it has trigger switch and that the XLR connectors are upside down.  You need to use two hands to unlock and then pull out the cable.  And heaven help you if you don't know there is a locking tab underneath and you keep trying to yank out the cable anyway! In use, the amplifier is very robust, going into and out of protection with no shut downs (when overdriven).  Note however that once it starts to clip, there is a high pitch whine from the power supply inductors.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started my testing with the amplifier module all the way to the left in the picture above (opposite of AC input).  Here is our warm up graph:Was glad to see the unit stabilize in a couple of minutes so I did not have to wait forever.  Once there, here is our dashboard:I don't know what is going on with the channel in blue producing a lot more power supply noise (relatively speaking).  Grounding made no difference.  As a result, one channel is 3 dB better than the other.  Averaging the two still lands the amp into our upper tier of all amplifiers tested to date:Despite the power supply issue above, signal to noise ratio is excellent and superb if driven to max power:Frequency response shows no sign of load dependency which can be common in class D amplifiers:Multitone test gets polluted by the aforementioned power supply interference:Crosstalk was not as good as I expected although in grand scheme of things, it is not bad:Let's see how much power this thing can pump out starting with 4 ohm load:We have more distortion than I like but that comes with a ton more power than our more accurate but less powerful amplifiers.  Allow 1% distortion and we get even more:Very impressive considering that you have 6 channels in this lightweight enclosure!As noted, power did not increase when I split the measurement between two independent modules at each end of the case. This indicates we are amplifier limited, not power supply (each module has its own power supply).Switch to 8 ohm we get better noise and distortion although the main issue is still there:Multichannel PerformanceI thought I was all set for measuring more than 2 channels only to find out the balanced cables I had bought had the wrong gender.    So all I could do was drive 3 channels at once:What you see is the same stereo pair measured with and without the extra channel also being driven (not shown in the graph).  There is no impact at all which makes sense as these are independent modules and nothing but the power cord is shared between them.Looking for consistency between the modules, I measured each one separately:ConclusionsWhile still way ahead of countless amplifier designs, the Hypex NC502MP modules are built more for power than ultra low distortion.  Not a bad compromise considering the fact that running out of power is quite audible and rise in distortion probably not.  Beauty of class D amplification is showcased by Buckeye in producing six times 600 watts of amplification in a light, and compact case.  I will do a teardown later but so far, I am happy with what is there, sans the upside down XLR connectors.EDIT: Teardown posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...ypex-nc502mp-multichannel-amp-teardown.27648/\",\n",

It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs €649.00 Tax excluded (US $735).I really like the differentiated look of the unit with custom front panel and white case which you can see better in this shot:Notice the ultra high quality and large binding posts and nice power switch.  Input is only balanced XLR as you see.  I believe the heart of the unit is Hypex NC122MP.boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2 MeasurementsThe unit stabilized quickly with its performance hardly changing (I optimized the cabling after this measurement so don\\'t worry about channel difference):Here is our dashboard:This level of distortion and noise (SINAD) nicely landed the amp into our \"excellent\" category:Signal to noise ratio was excellent, achieving better than CD dynamic range at just 5 watts of output:Typical of Hypex amplifiers (in a good way) is lack of load impedance dependency which plagues many budget class D amplifiers:The 2408/N2 achieved one of the lowest crosstalk I have measured:Multitone results are very good as well:Let\\'s see how much power we have:Not a ton but it is above average as far as noise and distortion.  Allowing a bit more distortion we get:Which is right on the money as far as company specifications.  Here is 8 ohm performance:Checking for frequency dependence we see well behaved response:But note the loss of power with 20 Hz input.Finally, here is the switching and ultrasonic performance:I checked the unit for temperature after all the test and could barely feel any rise above room temp on any of the surfaces.ConclusionsThe Arthur 2408 comes in an attractive and differentiated package with very high quality connectivity.  Measured performance is hugely above average although not state of the art.  I could not find any weakness in its performance no matter which way I measured it -- a sign of excellent engineering.  The cost is up there though for the level of power you get.  Seeing how company is represented here (@boXem | audio), support should be easy as well.I am happy to recommend the boXem ARTHUR 2408/N2.

I configured it using their online tool and it shows a cost of US $1,868.Not much to see or talk about as far as the case other than dual fans on top:Thankfully they did not come on during my testing but it is good insurance to have given the total power this unit can generate.The rear panel shows the usual balanced inputs although in this case it is 1/4 inch/XLR combo jacks:For my testing, I focused on channels 1 and 2.  Did plan to test the rest of the channels for total power but forgot that I had no way of generating that many balanced outputs so what you are about to see is for stereo only.  Seeing how the amp modules are stereo anyway, this should be representative of what you get even if turned on the rest of them at full power.KJF MA-01 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:We expect excellent performance from Hypex and we get it there, producing well above average SINAD which represents level of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is very high indicating a very quiet amplifier:32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" shows very low distortion as well:Frequency response is essentially flat with almost no dependency on whether I used 4 or 8 ohm test load:This means the frequency response should not change much when you switch one speaker for another (an issue with cheap desktop amplifiers).Crosstalk is very good:The meat of an amplifier review is the amount of power versus distortion+noise so let\\'s start with 4 ohm:Spec is 250 watts which is what we get if we allow more distortion than I do in the above graph:Seems that the power supply is designed to power the amp exactly as specified and no more and hence the lack of increase on bursts (above right).Switching to 8 ohm we get:I like the lower noise with 8 ohm better than 4 ohm.Finally, there is a bit too much disturbance when we change frequency and sweep for power than I like:But as noted on the graph, there are far worse examples.ConclusionsThe hypex NC252MP stereo amplifier modules do their job to product above average performance while running cool and efficient.  While I have not yet looked inside the KJF amp, from the outside it seems like they have not done anything to lower the performance of these nice modules.I am going to put the KJF MA-01 with Hypex NC252MP on my recommended list.Edit: see teardown here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...ma-01-hypex-nc252mp-amplifier-teardown.22770/',\n",

While it is fair bit deep, the other two dimensions are quite small.  Combined with the low weight of the unit, you feel like buying a dozen to spread around the house and two to take on the road with you!    The power button feels quite nice.  The rear terminals exude quality and would rival and beat what you find on many expensive amplifiers:Nice to see trigger input as well.Inside a Hypex NC252MP amplifier module with integrated switching power supply.  In use the bottom front got somewhat warm but nothing of concern.  Protection circuit is robust and auto recovers from overloads.If you are not familiar with my amplifier measurements, I highly suggest watching this video on amplifier measurements.AUDIOPHONICS MPA-S250NC MeasurementsLet's start with our dashboard:That is very competent performance as far as noise+distortion (SINAD):Zooming in:Noise performance is excellent:Class D designs can suffer from load dependencies but we can count on Hypex modules to be free of this:Crosstalk is very good despite both channels being on the same module:Multitone test showcases the low distortion:Dual tone 19+20 kHz shows the same:Only a couple of sidebands are visible at -98 dB and lower in audible band.Power curve was very clean with 4 ohm load:But strangely rose a bit with 8 ohm load:Back to 4 ohm, we almost get the specified level of power:I was pleased with rather smooth power vs distortion vs frequency:The MPA-S250NC passed my stress test with reactive loads of 4 and 8 ohm but shut down into 2 ohm:There is fair bit of pop on and off noise:Finally, the amplifier is stable and ready to go on power on:ConclusionsAudiophonics has produced one adorable stereo amplifier!  I just want to sit there and look at it.    Fortunately beauty goes beyond the skin, sporting a performance Hypex class D amplifier, producing top class results in all the measurements.  You get near state of the art performance at bargain prices with scant space needed to dedicate to the amplifier.I am happy to recommend the AUDIOPHONICS MPA-S250NC.  Can't stop smiling.....  \",\n",
       " ' JL Electronic\\'s (JLE) Sylph-D200 stereo amplifier module built on top of TI\\'s TPA3255 amplifier IC.  Depending on the configuration you pick, the module costs US $130 to $170.  You can read more about it here:  Or ask questions from the company representative @jlesterp.Testing bare modules is difficult for me so I asked for a finished system and that is what I received:Not much to see here so let\\'s look at the module inside:I must say that row of inductors looks pretty lined up that way.    I should note that the company is an ODM (white label designer) for other companies and is located in Philippines.  They provided their own measurements that correlate well with mine.There are two power supply configurations.  The version I have is the lower voltage one (36 volt?) that produces lower power than than if you choose to power it with 45 volt rails.JLE Sylph-D200 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:The gain is rather low compared to 29 dB that I usually see in amplifiers.  Then again this allows full power at the levels that our desktop DACs produce so it is fine.  I understand the base gain in the TI chip is lower still.  A buffer opamp is used to get up to 14 dB.  The lower gain gives an advantage to this board when it comes to other amplifiers which have more noise due to higher gain.  Still, let\\'s do our usual SINAD comparison:The board is just 0.1 dB short of falling in our superb category in blue!  I am told that there is a bit of SINAD loss at the speaker terminals as opposed to the board itself. If so, this is a remarkable achievement.Noise performance is excellent but again, keep in mind the lower gain:At 5 watts, it easily clears my 16-bit/96 dB hurdle.  This shows that we can build more optimized systems if we take full advantage of the output of our DACs with amplifiers that have lower gain.  The board can be configured with the feedback including the output filter or not.  The configuration I have has it including the filter which reduces load dependency but does not eliminate it:Multitone test shows the classic rise of distortion with frequency:Crosstalk performance was very good:Power sweep into 4 ohm load shows very low and interestingly, constant distortion ratio until hard clipping:Company thinks the input buffer is overloading.  As noted, to get more power you need to step up to higher voltage power supply.The hard clipping made it hard for AP software to properly determine the 1%THD point but did show the burst power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Testing for frequency sensitivity we see that behavior is decent:ConclusionsIt is amazing to see the progress these \"chip amps\" are making in the hands of capable designers.  They are inching their way to the top of the class in our distortion and noise rankings while keeping costs very low.  In the case of JLE, it is nice to see a design from another part of the world making it easier to access DIY oriented hobbyists to access them who are locally situated.  Interacting with member @jlesterp has been a delight as well.I am happy to recommend the JLE Sylph-D200 amplifier module.',\n",
       " 'This is the measurements of the March Audio P502 class D amplifier based on Hypex (?) modules.  It was kindly send to me by a member for testing.  The P502 costs US $1,075 from the company direct.This is not a review because the @March Audio is a long time member of the forum and I like to avoid conflict of interest.The unit comes in attractive aluminum packaging:On off control is a touch button which is unusual in power amplifiers.Here is a shot of the back:In hard use, the bottom plate gets quite warm.  Make sure you have plenty of ventilation from below.  A taller set of feet would help with this.My heavy stress test of frequency versus power caused the unit to shut down momentarily.  I did not retry it as I don\\'t want to risk damaging the unit.Warm Up TestAs is my standard practice now, I warm up and measure distortion and noise until the device stabilizes.  For amps, I do this at 5 watts.  Here are the results:As you see the channel in red is having a harder time, showing fair bit worse performance than the other.  It did improve momentarily after power up but then went back to the same state.  I checked all of my cabling and it was all secure.  So don\\'t know if this is an assembly issue or sample to sample variation.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Per warm up test, we see one channel with higher noise floor and differing distortion products.  Averaging the two channels still puts the P502 well above average amplifier:Frequency response was essentially flat in audible band with a resistive dummy load or my speaker simulator:Crosstalk was good enough and predictable:32-tone test simulating \"music\" shows that 1 kHz is actually the point of higher distortion.  Below and above performance improves:Signal to noise ratio is quite good:Except for the one channel lagging behind.  We are talking about 16+ bits at 5 watts reaching up to nearly 20 bits at full power.Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet\\'s start with 4 ohm load:That is a ton of power with very low distortion.  Letting the distortion go up to 1% gets us even more:Switching to 8 ohm load we get:ConclusionsLots and lots of power in above average performance and small package.  If you are going to drive a sub with it at full power, you may want to deploy more cooling/ventilation on the bottom.',\n",
       " ' IOM NCore Pro, Hypex NC252MP class-d based stereo power amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs €669 from the company website.The IOM Ncore Pro comes in very compact and solid enclosure:The on/off button feels very good but I find the fonts very cheesy.  That same theme continues in the back:I could not even read those fonts on the gain toggle switch until I took the above picture! Great to see XLR balanced inputs in addition to RCA.  Note the unusual, horizontal placement of the left and right speaker terminals.  I am used to them being stacked vertically when they are so close to each other.In use the top of the amp barely increased in temperature.  The bottom was a bit more warm but nothing remotely of any concern.  There were no shutdowns.  However, I did not try to stress load it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt into 4 ohm test.  I chose the XLR input and low (XLR) gain for all of these tests:The SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) of 94 dB places the OMI Ncore Pro in the upper tier of amplifiers/AVRs tested:Which was a relief after testing a number of home theater amplifiers that stacked on the right of the graph.Frequency response is dead flat but not super wide:Signal to noise ratio at max power output before clipping into 4 ohm was quite respectable:Here is the intermodulation distortion at very high frequencies (19 and 20 Khz tones):You have well over 16 bits of distortion free at modest listening levels.  Keep in mind that your music never has such high amplitudes at these frequencies.  So in practice, the distortion will vanish into noise.Crosstalk performance was excellent:The meat of any amplifier review is power versus distortion and noise.  Here it is at 4 ohm:Shame to see the early rise in distortion starting at 20 watts.  That aside, you have considerable amount of power clocking at 236 watts, both channels driven in this tiny enclosure.Switching to 8 ohm load we get:Now the early rise in distortion is more modest.  We get 125 watts of power at a SINAD of 91 db.  Interesting to compare it to Purifi 1E400A which produces similar power but a whopping 130 dB SINAD or 40 dB better!Peak power is sadly not much more than steady state due likely to regulated power supplies:Good thing the baseline level of power is quite good.ConclusionsThe IOM NCore Pro amp is a solid performer courtesy of competent hypex NC252MP class D amplifier modules.  The packaging is nice and tidy and the price seems reasonable to me.No, you are not getting state of the art performance.  That is in another category altogether.  But that level of performance will cost you more money and comes in a larger package.Overall I am happy to recommend the IOM NCore Pro amplifier. ',\n",
       " \" Buckeye Hypex NC252MP based, 6-channel amplifier.  It costs US $1149 as of this writing.  The owner/builder is @Buckeye Amps on our forum.The looks are fine for a well-priced build:The unit is quite light courtesy of rather thin sheet metal.  I am not as worried about the top being thin but the bottom is as well and that is where heat is generated.  You won't likely push all three modules to max but if you did, I would put taller feet under it and maybe even some temperature controlled fans.  In my testing the bottom just got a bit warm so not a major concern.Back panel shows standard connectors plus the trigger input:I stopped using my Mogami Gold XLR cables because I wanted to have colored ones.  I bought a batch from Amazon that is nice and flexible cabling but some kind of generic XLR connectors.  I have found them to be a hair worse than my Mogami cables as far as fit.  On the Buckeye amp though, I could barely get them into the XLR connectors and then back out.  I tried other XLR cables and my other generic ones were also stiff.  The Mogami cable however, was a bit tight but nothing as bad as my generic ones.  I know tolerances very but I had not seen this level of compatibility before with any other gear I have tested.  Anyway, it is a one-shot deal so not a big deal even if the problem exists.Buckeye NC252MP MeasurementsInternally we have three stereo amplifier modules.  So I decided to drive the unit in stereo using first and last channels.  This way we have some variation in modules and their placements.  Here are the results:Hypex spec is 0.002% which we are meeting here.  I could not figure out why the one channel had so much more mains noise (blue).  I tried every kind of grounding but it made no difference at all.  SINAD though is dominated by the second harmonic so that noise is not so material in that regard:So quite competent and better than any mass market AVR amplifier.Frequency response is pretty good for a class D amplifier:Signal to noise ratio is excellent even with that extra mains hum.  It nicely clears the noise floor of a 16-bit digital format:Crosstalk naturally was superb when measuring two different modules but also good in stereo mode in one module:Fascinating that a DIY amplifier can be so good whereas many premium audio products we test struggle here.Let's get into the meat of the review which is the power into 4 ohm load:The red pair of lines is using the two channels out of one amplifier module.  We see healthy amount of power to the tune of 224 watts each. Strangely when I tried two different modules (first and last as before), performance dropped some in both channels even though one channel is the same as before!  Maybe the two amps are fighting each other a bit for current.  Or there is some kind of beat frequency between them.  Not a real worry though as far as audibility but interesting nonetheless.Typical of these class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, there is no peak power:Here is our output with 8 ohm load:Testing for frequency dependency, we get good results as we expect from Hypex modules:ConclusionsI don't know the module price for the amps within this unit but getting 6 channels of amplification with such performance is a heck of a deal.  You are benefitting from a DIY person building these for you with no intention of making a living.    I will do a teardown soon and we can see if the internal build is good. I am happy to recommend the Buckeye 6 channel, NC252MP based amplifier.-----As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.Any donations are much appreciated using: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/how-to-support-audio-science-review.8150/\",\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of Accuphase E-270 Integrated Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from our friends at Gig Harbor Audio.  It is their demo unit so I have to return it on Tuesday.  So if you need something else to be measured, ask right away!  The E-270 was released in 2017 I think and retails for USD $5,000.  This is not cheap by our normal standards but in high-end audio, this is a pretty reasonable price.The industrial design of the unit seemingly has not changed from 1980s era with beautiful VU meters (with acceleration):At 44 pounds, the unit is quite heavy for its capabilities.  There is a massive transformer in the middle of the unit and the power amplifier modules with beefy heatsinks sit on either side.  During my testing, I could not even get the unit to become warm let alone hot!  It runs so comfortably that one thinks it is never going to stress out.The front has a slick finish that is lovely to touch.  Volume control is implemented through resistor ladders and hence has electronic control.  Accuphase says it has 6,500 steps which should be plenty for listening although was a bit difficult to dial in the exact value for measurements.There are slots in the back for optional DAC and phono stage (?) which mine did not have. All in all this is the type of construction, look and feel that would justify paying good bit of premium over a budget product. Given the likely reliability that comes from a high-end product from Japan, I say the stage is set for a good impression.Note: seeing how this is a demo unit to be sold, I did NOT attempt to stress the unit.  No long term warm up and certainly no stress test.  Given the overdesigned thermal design here though, I am not worried about the measurements holding under thermal stress.MeasurementsFor reasons that will become clear later, I decided to test the power amplifier section first.  Accuphase makes this dead easy with a front-panel button \"MAIN IN\" that decouples the power amp input from pre-amp output.  This allowed me to test the power amplifier separately and compare its performance to recently tested power amps.  So let\\'s start with our 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:I have added two more panels here: gain and dc output.  Have not verified the latter but should be correct.  As we see there is a 0.4 dB gain error and variation in distortion level.  The loads I use are not precision types (none are at these high power levels) so some of this may be instrumentation.  I did match levels (not shown) and distortion levels and differentials remained the same. At 92 to 95 dB SINAD, we are getting in territory of transparency for CD music.  The two distortion products are second and third harmonic at around -100 dB.Signal to Noise ratio is very good at 116 dB+:The E-270 is rated at 120 watts and it blows way past that to the tune of 155 watts prior to clipping (green pair):You can see the comparison to recently reviewed Onkyo M-282.  The E-270 outperforms it in every category from lower noise floor and distortion to more power prior to clipping.  The Onkyo of course is a budget product at $300. On not so good news, the Hypex based NC400 amplifier way outshines the Accuphase E-270.  It has far less noise, distortion and much more power. Whoever thinks class AB amplifiers are better than switching ones like NC400, this is the time to cry!  Pre-amplifierLet\\'s isolate the pre-amplifier and measure it at unity gain (same level output that is input):Wow, that is quite a bit better than the power amplifier with much lower noise floor and distortion.  Don\\'t get too excited though.  There are some really odd things going on here.  Let\\'s switch inputs to XLR:What the heck??? We lost 10 dB of performance.What is really, really strange is that if I measure RCA but leave the XLR cables connected, performance drops way down just the same!   You can see it easily in signal to noise ratio measurements:Accuphase hints at much lower performance of XLR input in the specs for the product:This aside, note as I have shown on the FFT chart above how we have lots and lots of power supply related spikes.  This is evident in an FFT of the spectrum (power amp only):Switching power supplies like used in Hypex NC400 amplifier shown in the inset in blue convert mains to DC and then convert it back to AC at hundreds much higher frequency (above audible frequencies).  As a result, you are free of mains related noise in good implementations.    There is no denying how clean the Hypex NC400 amplifier is in the audible band.  The Accuphase E-270 in contrast while cleaner than budget Onkyo M-282, has a ton of noise spikes.The problematic area for switching amplifiers is in the high frequencies so let\\'s look at that:The levels of noise and spurious tones is of course quite a bit lower than switching amplifiers.  We once again see that XLR input has worse performance (see zoomed inset).Let\\'s now re-measure the power versus distortion using the E-270\\'s pre-amp:We have a repeat of issues with XLR input again.  Notice the performance of RCA input with (red) and without XLR (blue) cable connected but not used.  And of course we leave fair amount of performance on the table with respect to the power amplifier alone. It seems that loading the pre-amp with the power amp reduces its performance substantially.  I traced this to pre-amp getting severely distorted when the power amp is under stress.  There is lack of isolation/independent power supply for the pre-amp.Story is the same with intermodulation distortion versus level:Interestingly enough the level sensitivity for XLR is the same as RCA.  I should be able to swing that to 4 volts for the same output with RCA at 2 volts.Frequency response falls in the category of very good news:I left the levels different for each input so that the graphs don\\'t fall on top of each other.  The power amplifier (blue) has the flattest response but by just a bit.  There is really no issue in the audible band to 20 kHz.ConclusionsOn fit and finish, the Accuphase E-270 integrated Amplifier delivers for a product in low thousands of dollars.  It has the nostalgic look of 1980s product which is popular now and certainly different than common mass market products.  Its power amplifier has respectable and conservative specifications.  Measurements show it to produce far more power than stated with massive thermal capacity which should spell long service life.Unfortunately I think there are some serious engineering issues in the pre-amplifier.  The XLR input not only generates much worse performance on its own, but also serves to pollute the performance of RCA input!  There is not sufficient power/isolation for the pre-amp causing its performance to sag when the unit is asked to produce a lot of power.  These are faults that I don\\'t tolerate in mass market products, let alone higher end ones.I would say if you want to get an Accuphase product, get a power amplifier.  The integrated unit as tested just doesn\\'t do that job so sadly, I cannot recommend it.EDIT: update the price to the correct one ($5,000 instead of $4,500).',\n",
       " 'This is a review and measurements of the Schiit Aegir stereo Power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member who has been patiently waiting since August for its review!  The Aegir is sold direct by Schiit and costs US $799 plus shipping.The Aegir is very heavy, substantial and serious looking piece of audio gear in black:What I don\\'t like is the extra sharp edges of the heatsinks on each side where you naturally want to grab it.  But I understand extruded aluminum comes this way and having the corners marchined would be expensive.Here is the back panel:At first I was super excited to see the XLR input but became puzzled why a stereo amp only has one of them.  Then I realized that it is only for driving the unit in bridged mode.  So for most of my testing I used RCA and then used XLR for bridged power testing.I can\\'t quite tell what type of amplifier this is from technical terms Schiit uses.  They seem to want to say this is mostly a class A amplifier but then it isn\\'t at higher power?  Anyway, the Aegir runs warm but not too hot so whatever trick they are using to lower power consumption of this unit versus pure class A is working.The Aegir is a new design which was introduced in 2018.  I see Audio Precision measurements for it which means it is part of the new design philosophy to take measurements and design verification seriously.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard feeding a 1 kHz tone into the amp, aiming for 5 watt output into 4 ohm:Starting on the left side, the gain of 20 dB is on the low side.  Then again the output power is so low (see later) that you don\\'t need a lot of gain to get to maximum power.SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) which is a positive dB version of THD+N mathematically (here anyway), puts the Aegir in respectable, above average ranking of all power amplifiers tested:We see good bit of power supply spikes which I verified to also exist in Schiit AP measurements.  Levels are below -100 dB so likely not audible due to our poor sensitivity in low frequencies.Frequency response is ruler flat in audible band:Signal to noise ratio is good, matching what we need for 16 bit audio playback:Multitone test tells us intermodulation between 32 tones fed to the amplifier:Once again, we see that we clear the 16 bit threshold of CD music.Most important test is power versus THD+N.  Let\\'s see that for 8 ohm:Schiit rates this amp at 20 watts into 4 ohm so we are close.  Likely they allow 1% distortion versus my standard of onset of clipping.What is puzzling is 4 ohm output:We are long ways away from 40 watts.  Then again, the clipping tilts to the right some so I suppose if you walked up that curve far enough, you get to 40 watts.  You would get good bit of distortion though so 40 watts is a marketing number.Note that one channel is more unhappy than the other.  I confirmed that exists just as well in Schiit measurements.  So likely power is fed is less efficiently to one amp than the other.  Or there are grounding, component mismatch, etc..To test bridged mode, I fed the Aegir vial XLR balanced connection and got this:I only get 23 watts of usable power which is hardly more than 19.5 watts I got in stereo mode.  The curve tilts to the right more now so marketing department went to town there to spec the \"80 watt number.\"  Measuring dynamic power which uses 1% number Schiit uses, we do get much more power:So with real music, you likely have more power than my continuous tone tests indicate.Let\\'s test how sensitive the Aegir is to input frequency:Sort of a classic output in that lower frequencies limit the amount of power available (clips earlier) but also have lower distortion.  I was asked to add multitone test to my amplifier measurements.  I usually use that for DACs since there, it is a lossless signal.  To use it for amplifiers, the signal has to be converted from PCM to analog which invokes the DAC in the AP.  That would put a limit on how good of a measurement I can make.  For amps like Aegir is not a limitation though so here it is:We see the general distortion floor is around -100 bits or 17 bits.  However, there are some earlier spikes due to power supply noise.  Again, our hearing is not very sensitive in that region so they can be ignored.ConclusionsThe Schiit Aegir is a competently designed amplifier with solid build quality and no design mistakes.  It shows the power of proper measurements and engineering verification to remove the element of surprise in third-party verification job we perform here.The main issue here is lack of power.  To someone like me, with very large spaces, rather inefficient speakers and desire for bass that you feel as much as you here, the Aegir is definitely not for me.  Nor do I buy into \"Class A\" having any benefit.  If it had, it would show up in measurements.  It does not.If have efficient speakers and/or don\\'t listen very loud, the Aegir is a solid offering from a western company.  I am going to put the Schiit Aegir on my recommended list for its solid engineering and design.  Fitness for application is up to you!  ',\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of a refurbished and upgraded NAD 2200 stereo amplifier. It was bought by a member, sent to QuirkAudio to be fully updated and then loaned to me. The work that Peter has done is exemplary.  The inside looks brand new! I have repaired hundreds of amplifiers but never seen one this clean!  So not only have the inside components been updated/replaced, but a lot of care has gone to cosmetically clean the unit. Peter sent me a long list of parts he has upgraded including reservoir capacitors and such. As a result, I don\\'t know how representative of measurements are of stock units although probably not too far off. Used 2200 go for about US $530 on ebay.The front panel is nice with an informative clipping indicator:As you see, you can put the amp in bridge mode (which I did not test) and select whether you want soft clipping on.  I left it off as you see in the picture.During use the protection circuit came on when appropriate and nicely reset as if nothing had happened.The NAD 2200 uses a dual voltage rail to keep power consumption and heat dissipation low when producing lower power and then upping the voltage for peak power.  This is a common technique but usually applied to low baseline power level.  Here, 100+ watts of power is provided using the low voltage power supply rail and it is only for power above that where the higher voltage is used.  Technique worked quite well as you see later and kept the amplifier cool and happy during my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:Not bad!  Distortion is at or below -100 dB.  With noise, SINAD degrades to about 93 dB putting the 2200 well above average of nearly 100 amplifiers tested to date:Notice that the gain is quite high at 32 dB.  Common range is 25 to 29 dB with the latter being a \"THX\" standard.  The higher gain increases noise so despite that, performance is as good as seen.  High gain makes it a good fit for AVRs for example that produce distorted output well below nominal 2 volts.Frequency response has a sharp roll off which seems to indicate the output is not direct coupled (DC) as is common today:Or maybe it is on purpose, I don\\'t know.Crosstalk is very good:As is dynamic range:It is power measurements where the magic of this amplifier comes to life so let\\'s look at that with 4 ohm load first:We can see a kink in distortion when we hit 200 watts as the unit sails past that to produce whopping 337 watts per channel, both driven!  Per design characteristics, you can have much more during momentary peaks:Wow, we have one kilowatt of power coming out of this amp in short duration!Switching to 8 ohm we see similar results as 4 ohm:Sweeping the power test at 4 ohm with different frequencies shows a well-behaved amplifier:You do loose power in higher frequencies but that is fine since music spectrum has lower energy there anyway.Due to the long duration of this test, the protection circuit likely backed off the high voltage rail, producing lower output levels.EDIT: adding Lab Input MeasurementsLab Input MeasurementsI was surprised that the frequency response was not flat but was relieved to see later in the thread that this is due to insertion of low and high pass filters.  So here is the frequency response with Lab input that doesn\\'t have such a filter:Response now (in green) as it should be, ruler flat to below 10 Hz, and well extending past the 40 kHz limit of this measurement.I figured the filters may be adding some noise/distortion so re-ran the dashboard again:Distortion doesn\\'t change but if you look at the noise floor at 20 Hz, it is down by some 10 dB.  That improves SINAD a couple of dBs, making the amplifier stand out even more!Zoomed:And signal to noise ratio:ConclusionsNice to see innovation like this from equipment that is over 30 years old!  Shame on manufacturers that produce amplifiers for much less power, more distortion and higher prices these days.  No, you don\\'t get a fancy case here and sheet metal is strictly budget category.  But you are not going to sit on the amp.  The guts are where it matters and NAD 2200 delivers.NOTE: the output relay on stock 2200 gets corroded and fails over time.  There are videos and DIY threads on how to upgrade the relay there to fix the problem.  The unit tested here has that fix.  Other than that, there are not reports of many other reliability issues even though NAD products are often said to be less reliable than other brands.Overall, I am happy to recommend the NAD 2200.  I almost gave it the highest honors but given the upgraded nature of the test unit, and the fact that used amps may have issues, I avoided that.  But you could have easily pushed me to give it the golfing panther.',\n",
       " ' Devialet Expert 200 Amplifier, DAC, Phono premaplifier and wired streamer.  It seems to be a generation behind the current products offered by Devialet.  The Expert 200 cost US $9,650. The Devialet line of amplifiers made quite a buzz when originally announced given its unique, lifestyle packaging which has not changed yet:A combination of class A amplifier and class D current source is used to keep the size down, and efficiency up. Innovative for its time was inclusion of an SD card and online configurator to change the operation of the unit including re-purposing the back RCA connectors:The thin package creates real compromises here with the exclusion of balanced analog inputs or preamp outputs. Usability suffers quite a bit as well with the display being on top of the unit which simply is not visible from afar.  There is provision for wall-mounting but come on, no audiophile is going to do that and then dangle the cables from it.There is a very substantial remote but strangely has no display on it.  That would consume a lot more power, likely requiring a charger and such.Trying to troubleshoot a problem let me to going to their configurator site and downloading SD images some 10 times.  I have to tell you, it gets old taking the SD card out of the unit, plugging it into a PC, making a simple change, put it back in the unit, wait for a restart, to see the effect.  Granted, you only do this once in a while but during experimentation is quite tedious.  In this day and age, such configurator should be inside the unit and activated vi an app or with a browser.  The data on the SD card is very small anyway (some kind of simple text file).  So it is not like it is data intensive.Overall, I think looks are put way ahead of function on Davialet amplifiers. I had planned to do a much more extensive review of this unit but sadly, right after my first power sweep, it shut down and no longer powers back on.    The online brochure talks extensive about protection measures.  Clearly they are not enough as I suspect the microprocessor board has failed as opposed to the amplifier that has health monitoring.  I am hoping Devialet is responsive to this review and failure and make good on repairing this unit.  I have never had an amplifier fail in such a simple sweep that keeps the power max for just a few seconds.Anyway, I had accumulated enough data that I thought it is worthwhile to post it while waiting for a response from Devialet.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsThe Devialet amplifiers digitize their analog inputs so I thought I start with our dashboard of 5 watts driving using USB input:Distortion products are quite low at < -110 dB.  However, the noise floor is high in low frequencies causing our SINAD to suffer a lot, ending with a metric of 92 dB.  This is well above average compared to all the amplifiers we have measured but way short of state-of-the-art:Analog input creates a lot of harmonic distortion and with it, drags down SINAD a few notches still:I don\\'t understand how their ADC could distort so much in a product this expensive.  It can\\'t even clear 15 bits of distortion-free range.There are some lofty numbers like -130 dB noise floor is thrown around by Devialet.  I am not sure how that is computed.  Using analog Line-in for consistency with other amplifier measurements we get rather ordinary numbers:Crosstalk is good but again, not state of the art:At this point I went to measure a simple frequency response and got stomped  big time.  No matter what I did, the output would drop off randomly between 8 and 10 kHz.  As mentioned, I messed with the configurator, doing everything in my power to turn off filters, tone controls, etc., nothing helped.  So I dug in with just feeding the amp a 15 kHz tone and noticed that the output would jump up and down especially in one channel!  What the heck is going on????My frequency response testing is at 5 watts as that is what I use in my dashboard.  Turns out this amplifier cannot reproduce high frequencies reliably at 5 watts!  It has some kind of limiter that kicks in and pulls power back.  It also does that at low frequencies but at or past maximum power.  That I can sort of understand but not the high frequency hold back.  To see this in action, I ran my THD+N vs Level vs Power test:Focus on the red line first.  That is at 20 kHz.  Notice how it actually zigzags back and forth as input level is increased, but output level does not.  Or even goes backward!  This must be the \"good\" channel as it produced 10 watts.  The other channel was more finicky and as noted, would get upset at even 5 watts.Problem severity goes down with frequencies but still there at 10 kHz as indicated by the light blue line which zips back at around 180 watts or so.At lower frequencies, the amp simply refuses to increase power and not go into clipping.With this knowledge, I reduced output power to below 1 watt and ran my frequency response sweep:This is line-in so is digitized.  It produces about 48 kHz of bandwidth which is fine.  What is not so fine is that there is a phase shift between channels as frequencies go up:Some kind of filter is active here that is causing a phase shift between channels.  Even if there is some processing active (which there shouldn\\'t be as I disabled tone control and \"SAM\" speaker EQ), it should affect both channels equally as far as phase.Our story ends with my power measurement as noted:This is healthy amount of power at 269 watts with both channels driven into 4 ohms.ConclusionsWhile the Devialet is an elegant looking audio device, it clearly sacrifices usability and reliability/performance to get there.  There is something clearly wrong in the way it handles high frequencies.  No, this is not just me saying that.  It is also buried in the stereophile measurement of another one of their units: $10,000 amplifier can\\'t produce more than 20 watts at high frequencies without \"power supply collapsing?\"  Conclusions like this don\\'t help:No, this is not a testament to how good an amplifier can get.  No amplifier should power limit to just 20 watts (or lower in my case) in high frequencies.  We have issues with class D amps generating out of band noise that causes measurements to be low in this regard.  But they are producing full power.  Not so with Devialet. Then we have the phase shift.  Poor usability with \"sneaker net\" style of shuffling SD cards back and forth to make simple changes.And of course the total failure of the unit under a simple industry standard test of power sweep.I feel sad that an amplifier has failed under my watch.  I hope Devialet steps up and makes this right for the owner. ',\n",
       " \" Emotiva PA-1 monoblock class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and unfortunately discontinued.  When it was being sold, it cost $299.There is not much to look at here other than a blue indicator for when the unit is on:It is a balanced amplifier which is nice:There is an automatic trigger as you see. I tested it using always-on mode.I believe this is based on some ICEPower module from B&O (300AS1?).  In use the PA-1 didn't even get warm to touch.  Protection circuit was very good in that if you overload it, it clips but keeps going.  Other amps shut down requiring power cycling and such which an become annoying in my testing.Emotiva PA-1 MeasurementsOur standard dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm (1 kHz tone) shows very good performance:Distortion is at -100 dB which is quite nice making SINAD around 92 dB:This is well above our average of 78 across nearly 140 amplifiers tested to date.SNR is very good nearly matching my target of 96 dB at 5 watts:Multitone shows the same good performance:Frequency response unfortunately shows dependency on speaker impedance:Power into 4 ohm shows early rise of distortion:I cut off the power early in that graph.  If one allows it to go higher in distortion it produces a lot more power:Switching to 8 ohm we get:Changing frequency shows what non-state-of-the-art class Ds produce:Namely a transfer function that changes with frequency and much higher distortion.Here is the spectrum of the switching frequency:ConclusionsIt is hard to get perfection at this price point but the Emotiva PA-1 tries hard.  It is a small package that runs cool yet produces well above average noise and distortion ratings.  It is a shame it is discontinued.I am going to put the Emotiva PA-1 on my recommended list.  Hopefully you can find some in second hand market or something.\",\n",
       " \" Yamaha R-N803 Receiver, amplifier, and streamer.  It was purchased by a member (b-stock?) and drop shipped to me.  The R-N803 costs US $750 from amazon including Prime shipping.The R-N803 has AV-style features such as Room EQ but with only two channels of amplification.  It has a retro look which is quite a bit nicer than an AVR though:Alas, beauty is only skin deep.  Those nice vertical controls are loose and have nowhere near the great feel of the 1970s gear with their solid mechanical selectors.  The back panel shows how the video features have been stripped away:As a package, it is much more appealing than the monster size of typical AVR.  So not a bad effort.Internally there are decent size heat sinks, one for each channel.  This is a huge step up from a shared flimsy heat sinks we see in modern AVRs with many channels.  This resulted in high robustness as in my testing, nothing caused the R-N803 to shut down or go into protection mode.  With AVRs it is common for them to do these things even though I still drive them with just two channels.Receiver Amplifier TestingI exclusively used the CD input for my testing.  There is a button for Pure Direct as there is on AVRs so let's engage that and see what we get:I set the volume control to +3 db to get the nominal 29 dB of gain.  Measurements were not that different at 0 dB.  I had to play fair bit to get rid of some ground loops (this is 2-pin, insulated device).  Once there, I was rewarded with pretty good SINAD which is a combined measure of distortion and noise:As you see, the ranking is way above average of just 77 dB SINAD.Switching off pure direct mode however, causes severe performance drop:Noise floor as moved massively up and distortion has increased.  Now we are back in the poor category of AVRs.  Sadly to use Room EQ you need to operate in this mode so you have a tough decision of whether you want to have low noise/distortion or room EQ.Dynamic range in pure mode is good:As is crosstalk:Frequency response is excellent in pure mode as well:Turning off pure (green) causes a sharp drop near 50 kHz which seems to indicate the input is digitized using 96 kHz sampling.  It is nice that this rate is a lot higher than many AVRs use.  Not so nice is the non-flat response even though I set all the controls to the middle.There is plenty of power into 4 ohm load at lower distortion and noise than a number of AVRs:Switching to 8 ohm load and measuring pure and non-pure modes, shows the poor performance of the latter:I had a slight issue with this test.  Just minor wiggling of the speaker terminals caused one channel to get distorted much earlier.  Not sure what is going on with that.Back to 4 ohm load, we see that we have plenty of headroom for momentary peaks in music:And here is our power test with different frequencies:At low frequencies approaching 20 Hz, distortion rises above 60 watts or so (orange).  Otherwise, this is a predictable performance with high frequencies being a bit more distorted than low.  And this is a good thing compared to nasty curves with get in some switching amplifiers.ConclusionsAs a pure, analog integrated amplifier, the Yamaha R-N803 does well.  It produces ample amount of power into 4 ohm with pretty low distortion and noise.  The visuals are also quite attractive.  Digital mode to use such things as Auto-EQ/filters is rather poor due to similar issues in many AVRs.  Sad that Yamaha did not go the extra mile and produce a better subsystem here.I personally don't like to use an AVR as a stereo setup due to their large size and not so pretty face plate.  So in that regard, I appreciate the Yamaha R-N803.Given the good, pure analog mode performance, and nice looks, I am going to put the Yamaha R-N803 on my recommended list. \",\n",
       " ' Audiophonics DA-S250NC class D amplifier (hypex NC252MP) and stereo DAC/Bluetooth. It was requested by a member and supplied by the company. It costs 582,50 € (tax excluded) (US$641).I really like the front panel display.  It has large font and super responsive rotary encoder that is a delight to use.  The power switch and input selections feel good as well.  Back panel shows the fact that only digital inputs are provided:In use the unit was robust in operation and recovered automatically from overloads.Audiophonics DA-S250NC DAC MeasurementsUsing pre-out, I measured the performance of the DAC.  Let\\'s start with our dashboard:I was surprised that I could not get more than 0.8 volt out of the pre-out. Like to see 2 volts.  Likely this is optimized for the gain setting of the integrated amplifier. Distortion is below -110 dB but because output level is rather low, noise drags that down to SINAD of 103 dB.  This is still competent performance:SNR is good enough for 16 bit content:Linearity is near perfect:Multitone is quite good until you get to upper registers:IMD vs level shows that impact of noise level:There were regular pulses at 1 KHz which is the USB sub-packet buffer size:I tried changing the filter settings but they seemingly made no difference:Might as well as this is a fine choice anyway.  Attenuation could be better, hurting THD+N vs frequency:Overall performance of the DAC is not bad.  Question is, is it good enough to not impact the amplifier performance?Audiophonics DA-S250NC Amplifier MeasurementsUsing the same USB input, I measured performance by setting the front panel volume control to -16.5 dB to get 5 watts and change output:This is very good performance, landing the amplifier well above average of all products ever tested:Zooming in:Noise performance is very good, almost meeting my 16 bit minimum SNR at 5 watts:Frequency response is nice in that it doesn\\'t show any load dependency:Crosstalk is better than average of all amps tested:Multitone test shows very good performance with almost no frequency dependency:I could barely get the amplifier to clip at max digital input/volume control:This tells me that we could have a bit more output voltage from the DAC to drive the amplifier.  This impacts 8 ohm more:Note that you want to operate in clipping region but a bit of power is left on the table as far as measurements are concerned.Since the amplifier barely distorts, I could not run my standard max and peak power using 1% THD metric.  I had to dial that down to 0.3% get max power:I was not able to run burst power due to same issue.  Note again that this is a \"good thing\" in that the amplifier just doesn\\'t distort enough to get more burst power.Let\\'s switch the load now from 8 to 2 ohm while also changing the phase angle as to represent capacitive and inductive loads:I am impressed that it handled 2 ohm at all but 60 degrees capacitive.  Output voltage dropped though so you don\\'t get to keep \"doubling down.\"  Likewise we lose output voltage at the extremes of ± 60 degrees at 4 and 8 ohm.Finally, as I suspected, you get double power on glitch with the amp and DAC powering on in sequence, resulting in some noise:ConclusionsThe DA-S250NC caught my eye from the moment I looked at the website.  The combination of a DAC and class D amplifier just makes sense to me for most people who only want a digital input. Many \"smart\" amplifiers exist in this domain but they are usually compromised.  Seeing a DAC married to hypex amplifier and combined with a nice front panel/remote seemed to be the ticket.  In testing, the DAC performance is just good but seems to be mating well enough to the amplifier.  Any more performance and it would kind be wasted there.  So I can\\'t complain much.  A version of this with higher performance DAC and amplifier would be just dandy!  Overall, I like and recommend the Audiophonics DA-S250NC.',\n",
       " ' NAD C 320BEE power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan.  The C 320BEE is a vintage product, dating back to 2003 I think.  The BEE designation is apparently a reference to Bjorn Erik Edvardsen who was one of their designers.  Can\\'t tell if he designed this version or this is based on work he did years earlier.  Either way, I am told it is a \"classic.\"  I don\\'t keep up with such things but I am sure some of you will set me straight if that is, or isn\\'t so.  From what I can tell the original cost was US $399.  So quite a budget piece for a mid-tier brand like NAD.The C 320BEE is typical of NAD design language which is maintained to this day:There are set of tone controls and balance which I appreciate in this day and age when it is removed from most gear.I did not seek out the manual and remain unsure how this thing powers on.  You hit the power button but nothing happens until you press one of the input buttons???Here is the back panel:It is an old school layout with non-removable power cord, jumper set for pre to power map.  And a set of RCA jacks lined up.The unit appears to run cool but there are large holes on the bottom where the amplifier heatsink is and if you touch that heatsink, it gets quite hot.In testing, without undue stress, the unit went into protection and would not reset until I cooled it off with a fan and left it off for a few minutes.  Most amps survive my testing without going into protection mode since I only push them to max power for seconds.Also, in the process of changing my setup for 4 to 8 ohm, the unit went into oscillation, producing 107 watts on its own with no signal.  So there is some instability in the design.  This happened when I changed my load impedance to 8 ohm so perhaps you won\\'t see it if you don\\'t mess with speaker output while the unit is on.To be on the safe side, for the last few tests I put a fan on top to keep it cool and that got it to run very reliably. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard into 4 ohm:The highest distortion product is at -100 dB.  Since out SINAD (signal to noise and distortion), is only 90 dB, it means there is 10 dB of noise that is degrading that.  All else being equal, noise is less of an audible problem than distortion so that is good.  Take at its value, the C 320BEE clocks much better than many other amplifiers we have measured in this regard:Drilling into the 1 kHz tone spectrum we see the nice clean output of classic AB amplifier:Those of you who hate class-D spectra in ultrasonics, can rejoice now.  Signal to noise ratio is good but is power dependent:I think the spec is a few dBs better than this but I am sure you can mess with levels and volume control position to get there.  Either way, this is plenty clean for CD/16-bit playback.Crosstalk is unremarkable compared to state-of-the-art:Fortunately, this should not be an audible issue as there is plenty of separation between channels here.  Frequency response is broad and quite flat in audible band:Even at 100 kHz, the response is only down 1 dB.  So your high-resolution music can sing without the amplifier truncating their bandwidth.Let\\'s look at intermodulation distortion (two tones at 60 and 7 kHz) versus power output:This is a well-behaved amplifier until it gets to its limit and then clips hard as amplifiers tend to do.  Of note, there is a \"soft clip\" light but I did not see it come on in any of my tests.We can run the same test but with two high frequency tones of 19 and 20 kHz:Forgetting about the ultrasonic ones around 38 kHz, the distortion sidebands remain at -100 dB which is very nice.  You can play your 16 bit content without worrying about any distortion above its noise floor.Most important test is power versus distortion.  Let\\'s start with 4 ohm load:This is very modest level of power but no strangeness in its response.  We can run the test again but compare to modern \"streaming\" amplifiers of today:We have very clean power compared to them but less power as compared to either SONOS or Amazon Link Amp.  The NAD does outperform the NuForce STA-200 though in every respect.  Switching to 8 ohm gets us this:I am puzzled that power output remains identical in both cases.  Something must be controlling that.The graph of distortion versus frequency at power levels is quite messy as it typically is:Putting aside the light pink which is at or near clipping, the amp if well behaved with only a modest rise in distortion as power levels increase.To keep things exciting , I added a new measurement to this test.  It is the \"dynamic\" power according to CEA-2006/490A designed to keep car audio amplifier companies honest with peak power:These are burst power measurements.  Let me know if you like them and I will run them in future reviews.  I think there is some merit to measuring this way as music is not continuous sine wave.ConclusionsNice to go back in time and test amplifiers which were simple to understand and simple to measure.  The NAD C 320BEE seems to have been competently designed for modest power delivery at a budget price.  In that regard, it completely succeeds in its mission.Personally, I think 67 watts is not enough for home listening.  Today\\'s speakers have become smaller in size and shrunk in efficiency, needing fair bit of power to get them to produce proper dynamics.  If you disagree otherwise, or have sensitive speakers, the NAD C 320BEE seems to be a good unit to buy.  It certainly does away with any anxiety you may have with using class-D amplification.',\n",
       " ' Yamaha WXA-50, multi-function DAC, pre-amp, power amp, streaming and multi-room unit.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Even though it came out a few years ago (2016?), it is widely available.  Amazon shows it costs US $478.Success of SONOS as a multi-room audio solution has been the envy of many traditional audio companies.  Many have tried to chase them with Yamaha being one of the earlier ones.The WXA-50 is a surprisingly heavy unit although looks somewhat unremarkable:The case is metal as best as I can tell which is good as the unit generates good bit of heat.  Strangely the heat is concentrated on the left side yet the vents are on the right!  There is an IR hole on the left which confused me to no end, constantly wanting to push it to turn on the unit.  I am not a fan of a single light indicating input and overload condition of the amplifier.  Worst part of the interface is the volume control which has no marking and no display.  Unless you use the app, you have no idea what volume you have set this to.  This made my testing maddeningly hard.I downloaded the App and here, I was pleasantly surprised by the performance and reliability of it.  With no configuration, the WXA-50 was recognized and manipulating its controls were instantaneous and reliable.  I only used the App to reset the EQ, etc. so for its full functionality, you should seek out other reviews.The back panel has extensive set of inputs and outputs although lacks USB:I was pleased to see both analog input and outputs.Yamaha heavily courted the Custom Install (CI) industry to use this instead of SONOS and it shows from inclusion of trigger input and output for control.  Inclusion of Toslink input goes along these lines to fetch audio from a TV being fed by HDMI.DAC Audio MeasurementsI briefly measured DAC performance.  I read however that there are two DAC chips inside this unit (an ESS and Bur-brown/TI) and that the fixed output is driven by the latter.  So this may not be representative of what happens when you stream music into this device:This is decent performance although it degraded fair bit if I turned up the volume on the amplifier to max.  That increased the higher order harmonics even though the output level of the DAC did not change.  We have seen this before and likely is the power supply sagging causing DAC performance to suffer.  SInce you don\\'t listen at max volume level, I did not derate the WXA-50 performance when including it in the performance chart:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsSince we have analog inputs, I started my testing using that and got this for our usual dashboard at roughly 5 watts:I played around with combination of input levels and volume control and performance was pretty consistent.  SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) is actually quite respectable for an amplifier:I tested the same, this time using Roon to stream the 1 kHz tone to it using Airplay:We lose just a couple of dBs although distortion levels are a bit lower.From here on, I tested the unit using its analog input unless specified.Frequency response shows decent bandwidth and flat response in audible band:No strange and limiting digitization of input is visible which is good.Signal to noise ratio is good enough for 16 bit audio:Let\\'s get into all important measurement: power into 4 ohm versus distortion:We are close to meeting the spec (I measure at much lower distortion than they do).  We have cleaner power than either Sonos or Amazon amps although the SONOS has much more power.Here is the performance at 8 ohm:I don\\'t have as much data for 8 ohm but what is there, shows competent performance but with just 55 watts on tap.Intermodulation distortion versus power level tells a similar story:THD+N versus frequency and power shows very predictable performance with no corner cases exposed:Only 20 Hz tones gives it a bit of trouble with rising distortion above 10 watts but that is slight.The unit also shut down at 20 kHz at max clipping level. I reduced the volume level a few notches and that went away even though I was still pushing the unit into hard clipping.Spectrum of 1 kHz tone with no AES filter shows the usual noise in high frequencies we get from class-D amps:While this looks ugly, the spikes near audio band are way down at -75 dB which is very good.  I have tested amps where these levels are much, much higher.The two channels have different switching frequencies.  Not sure if this is on purpose or variation in the clock source of their modulators.  The two beat against each other likely creating the intermodulation spikes that we see throughout the range.ConclusionsUnlike the bag of parts performance I often see in these modern streaming products, the Yamaha WXA-50 seems to have benefited from some attention to raw performance of each subsystem.  There are no funny results, strange pipelines that go in and out of digital domain, etc.  The performance graphs are all smooth with no sudden jaggies or other anomalies.  This makes it easier to use the unit, not having to work around its weakness (I am talking to you SONOS).We also have decent amount of power, approaching 100 watts into 4 ohm which should be plenty.  If you add the subwoofer to it, you will be golden even at high SPLs.The app likewise, gives a feeling of polish that I often find lacking in competing products.In summary, I did not raise an eyebrow when measuring the Yamaha WXA-50.  It won\\'t provide competition to state-of-the-art separate products but it also doesn\\'t embarrass.  As such, I am going to put the WXA-50 on my recommended list.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.I was reading that the standard diet for panthers is large animals such as deer, antelope, etc.  I have not fed anything like that to my panthers and they are starting to mumble \"animal abuse\" under the lips.

       " ' PS Audio Stellar S300 Stereo Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The S300 costs US $1,499 from the company.Fitting the design language of the rest of the PS Audio and using similar enclosure, the S300 is quite hefty considering that it uses class-D amplification:There is just a power switch and light that indicates whether the unit is on, or has shut down due to protection circuit kicking in.The back panel shows very high quality and beefy connectors:As you see, there are redundant pairs of speaker sockets which I assume is an invitation to use bi-wiring.  Or feed the subwoofer using them as Paul McGowan advocates although a warning tells you to be careful as these are floating signals, not ground referenced.XLR inputs are nicely provided which I used for all of my testing.The internal amplification is provided by ICEpower 300AS1 modules.  These are integrated power supply and single channel amplifier modules.   PS Audio uses its own input buffer on these which they call \"Analog Cell.\"  This got the owner worried that it would measure poorly as did the PS Audio Stellar Gain Cell Preamplifier and DAC.  I must say it got me worried reading the description of it too:Seeing how the class-d module uses ample feedback to linearize its response, it is puzzling that he thinks the input stage should be without one.  Either feedback is good ro bad.  Can\\'t have it both ways.Anyway, back to the operation of the unit, it ran cool and never got upset in my testing.  Overall, my subjective impression of the unit is positive.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs always, we start with 5 watt output into 4 ohm and see where we stand:Ah, that is respectable!  FFT spectrum just shows two distortion products with the second one at or below -100 dB.  There is however noise though which pushes the combination of those distortions and noise to -88 dB resulting in SINAD of same amount, only positive.  This puts the S300 amplifier above our median for all power amplifiers tested so far:Our frequency response is a bit variable at the high end:I looked up the 300AS1 response as shown in the inset and is consistent with that.  While most of us won\\'t hear that rise in response, it does show load dependency which means each speaker will interact with it differently.All my tests use an AES-17 filter which has a flat response to 40 kHz and beyond.  But for the purposes of finding the actual high-bandwidth spectrum of the unit, I take it out for this test of 1 kHz tone at 5 watt:Switching frequency is around 450 kHz which is fine.  Typical of many of these class-d modules, the level is high at just -15 dB below signal. @DonH56 recently asked me if the level of switching noise tracks the signal itself so I decided to test for that by upping the power by a good bit to 180 watts and see what happens:As you see in blue, there is good news and bad news.  Good news is that the level doesn\\'t scale with output power much.  Bad news is that its spectrum becomes quite wide so total energy may have increased that much.  Certainly scary to the eye but likely not to the ear.  Anyway, back to our regular programming, here is our signal to noise ratio:Not that good at 5 watt as we could have predicted from the SINAD in the dashboard.  At full power the situation improves but still not very competitive with top of the class switching amplifiers which can clock as high as 125 dB.  So be careful with sensitive speakers.Most important graph for amplifiers is power versus distortion+noise.  Here it is into 4 ohm:We have tons of good power to the tune of 256 watts.  Distortion starts to rise early though at just 10 watts.Here is the response into 8 ohm:Perhaps more revealing is what happens if we perform the same sweep but at different frequencies starting at 20 kHz and working our way down to 20 Hz.  An ideal amplifier would have all the graphs landing on top of each other.  But this is what we get here:At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the graphs indeed nicely land on top of each other (bottom group).  But at 5 kHz and higher, we get very odd responses indicating multiple non-linearities taking turn to dominate.  I thought this was an issue with PS Audio implementation but the same response is shown by ICEPower in their data sheet.Peak power shows disappointing level of headroom available for short durations as would be typical in music:The switching power supplies in class-d amplifiers are tightly regulated which means the power you get in steady-state, is what you get in peak.  Standard class AB amplifiers tend to have variable supply rails which if you don\\'t tax much, will maintain higher voltage and produce more power in short bursts.  For this reason, you may want to get a more powerful class D amplifier to replace a class AB amp.ConclusionsIt is a sigh of relief that PS Audio had not managed to reduce the performance of the ICEPower modules.  Response and sonic abilities are completely determined by those modules unlike what PS Audio marketing says.  The ICEPower module used here has a distinctly lower performance than Hypex modules we have tested in the past. So you are not going to get state-of-the-art performance.  For that, you need to go to amplifiers higher in the SINAD graph.Still, this is a competent, well-built and well-supported amplifier based on proven amplification modules within.  Build quality is much higher than DIY or garage shop amplifiers using Hypex modules.  $1,500 is not a ton of money given these attributes.  For these reasons and good looks of the unit, I am going to put the PS Audio Stellar S300 amplifier on my recommended list.',\n",
       " \" NAD 7050 integrated DAC, amplifier and streaming playback.  It is on kind loan from a member.  It appears the product was announced in 2014 and since discontinued as I can't find it on sale anywhere.  The cost was USD $999 from what I can gather.The unit can be used both horizontally and vertically.  A rotational sensor changes the display orientation conveniently.  Here is its upright position which I consider better for sound since the electrons can naturally free fall into the speaker terminals:The outside has what appears to be some sort of rubber glued to it.  It is soft to touch but picks up dirt very easily and is impossible to clean due to sticky nature of it.The large knobs imply great feel which they don't have.  They wobble as you rotate them.  The larger knob is the volume control which had an odd delay in updating the display as you rotated it.  Overall, a good effort has been made to create an unusual design but didn't quite get there in feel and functionality.The back panel shows off the inputs and speaker output:For my testing, I focused on USB input as I suspect that is the most common interface for consumers.  Alas, the USB interface is class one so only goes up to 96 kHz.  To get the advertised 192 kHz you need to use the other inputs.  I downloaded the NAD drivers which nicely gave me ASIO interface for testing.There is an app to control it and I downloaded it from Android play store.  It is a simple remote control but allowed me to change the audio-out to be full range so I could use it for DAC testing.  Otherwise it is filtered for subwoofer out.  Despite its simplicity the app crashed on me once.There is no analog input so I had do all of my testing with USB digital interface.As expected from a brand name company, the NAD 7050 comes with full set of safety and emissions regulatory certifications.The amplification in NAD 7050 apparently is a scaled down version of what is in NAD M2.  Here is what NAD says about it:My read is that it is a power DAC similar to Lyngdorf TDAI-3400 I reviewed recently.  Measurements will confirm if so.DAC MeasurementsAs usual, where possible I try to isolate the performance of the subsystems, in this case the DAC.  Here is our dashboard view using USB input/Line Out.  I hope you are sitting down if you owan the 7050 and use it as a DAC:What the heck is going on here?  Even at 0 dB the unit doesn't get to 2 volts yet it severely clips resulting all of those harmonic distortions.  Dialing down to -2 dBFS improved performance but just to 83 dB. By then the output voltage was even lower, making it not so useful as a DAC anyway.  My thinking is that this is a split off output from the power amplifier as opposed to a traditional DAC output.   I guess for the assumed subwoofer duty it may be OK.Naturally, with the SINAD as measured falls at the bottom of the graph of DACs tested:After the first bad impression, the 7050 almost nails the rest of the measurements such as linearity:And jitter:Since USB doesn't support 192 kHz, I had to run a different multi-tone test at 44.1 kHz:Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual, the dashboard view is at 5 watts of power into 4 ohm:As power amplifier measurements go, this is not too bad actually and almost matches the vaguely stated 90 dB spec by NAD.Power versus distortion+noise is also pretty decent:The downward part of the curve is always dominate by noise as the output level is low.  Here, that part of the curve is flatter than I am used to seeing which is good as far as level of noise.  Likewise, distortion is kept under complete control until onset of sudden and massive clipping at 54 watts.  This too is good (sans the clipping).  Stated rating is 50 watts at 4 ohm and we beating that a bit which is nice.  Then again, 50 watts is not that much power in grand scheme of things.THD+N versus frequency using my default 45 kHz bandwidth shows pretty awful results (in red):Suspecting ultrasonic noise at play, I re-ran the test with 22.4 kHz (as with the dashboard) in blue which shows that effect quite conclusively.  One channel is worse than the other though which is strange.  Note that the drop above a few Khz is due to bandwidth of the test being too low to capture all the harmonics (and hence the reason I like to use 45 kHz bandwidth normally).Broadband FFT shows of 1 kHz tone shows us what is going on:This is without my Audio Precision high-frequency filter (AUX-0040).  All the other tests used that filter.On the extreme left we see our 1 kHz tone as a spike rising to 0 dB or so.  We have a single and large spike at 850 kHz.  That seems to indicate to me that 850 kHz may be the switching frequency.  Given its high frequency, the power DAC is running likely with as a single bit converter which would create a lot of quantization noise.  Noise shaping is used to push that above 30 kHz or so with the peak at about 80 kHz.  This is the drawback of power DACs as we have seen in the Lyngdorf and SONOS Amp versus class D amplification which doesn't need noise shaping.  You can see the effect of high frequency noise in the thickened sine wave of the same signal in the inset.ConclusionsUsually, by the time I get to the end of testing, I have a good idea of if I like or don't like a device.  Here, I am not quite sure.  Let's agree that no one should be using the NAD 7050 as a DAC with external amplification as NAD suggests in the manual.  You will be listening to a heap of distortion products with anemic output to boot.The amplifier seems to have some good tricks under its sleeves with lower than normal noise and very controlled distortion until a very hard limit.  My issue there is the 50 watt rating for a $1000 device.  That is just not enough power for a product in this category.Seeing how the NAD 7050 is discontinued, maybe it doesn't need my recommendation or lack thereof anyway.  So I will leave it at that.  \",\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $89.99 with stock 32 volt supply.  Price goes up to $109.99 with the 48 volt supply.  There is a $10 discount coupon right now.Despite its budget price, the V3 manages to look elegant with the hole pattern on top and large and smooth feeling Volume/On/Off control. Power supply is external and as noted, you get a choice:As you will see later, you really want the 48 volt version:Yes, it is a larger supply but you are going to hide it behind your desk anyway so might as well live the good life with the increased power there.  The amplifier is based on TI TPA3255 class D amplifier IC.  There are replaceable op-amps for those of you who have nothing better to do than mess with the design.When I took the amplifier out of the package, I noticed something rattling in there.  Fearing the worst, I took the unit apart. Turns out one of the two large power supply caps had lost its adhesion to the PCB. The putty used is to keep the cap glued to the PCB was too flexible and had broken loose. No harm though as the cap is laying on its side and can\\'t go anywhere. The sound I was hearing was it moving just a hair up and down and hitting the top of the case.  Suggest company use a different material to fix this.I will post the pictures of the insides later.  For now, a large aluminum couples the amplifier IC to the case. There is no thermal grease but the amp ran cool enough that I don\\'t think you need to worry about it. But if you are, this you can remedy yourself.  Despite me pushing the amp to max power repeatedly, it just got warm to touch.  The protection circuit was the best kind with high tolerance of clipping and audio-restart.Fosi Audio V3 Amplifier MeasurementsI performed the low power tests using the 32 volt supply.  The rest is done with both.  So let\\'s start with our usual dashboard:Distortion is nicely kept to -100 dB so we are noise limited causing SINAD to land around 88 dB.  This is well above average for all amplifiers tested:Notice how many amplifiers it beats to the right of it!Noise performance is also quite good for the class, almost clearing the hurdle for 16 bit content at just 5 watts:Frequency response shows load dependency which all class D amplifiers in this price range show:In English, this means that depending on which speaker you use, the sound may be a bit bright or a bit dull if your hearing extends to 20 kHz.  You can counter with EQ (which you better have for good sound in your room).Multitone and 19+20 kHz show good performance for the class:Edit: forgot to post crosstalk measurement:Let\\'s see how much power we can get out of this little box into 4 ohm:You normally wouldn\\'t expect to get more power with a 48 volt supply compared to 32 volt when their current ratings are the same.  But as I noted in the picture at the start, the larger power supply is conservatively rated and is able to pump out more current for peaks.  We can see this in our short-term power measurements:With 8 ohm volt, we are more in need of voltage so naturally we get tons more there as well with the 48 volt supply:Transfer function is quite good for class D and I was especially impressed with its ability to pump out same power at high frequencies as many amplifiers go into protection there:There is some pop noise when turning on and off but it is very mild:The amplifier is stable on power up:Some of you have been aiming at creating more work for me by asking for for efficiency tests. I developed a test that is semi-automatic and provides reasonable accuracy (within 5%):Note that part of the heat is dissipated in the power supply and part in the amp.  The X axis is power per channel, not total (amp is driven in stereo).Edit: here are the teardown pictures:ConclusionsState of the art DACs run on highly performant silicon that when well implemented, produces the best performance we have seen.  We are seeing similar development with these class D IC amplifiers.  Noise and distortion is quite low and beats many amplifiers in the market.  They bring two drawbacks: external power supplies and load dependencies.  If the latter is resolved, these amplifiers would obsolete large segment of the audio market!The Fosi Audio V3 is well implemented and brings nice looks and design at a bargain price.  Company is also quite receptive to customer input and is a delight to work with behind the scenes.  I don\\'t know what else we could ask for!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio V3 stereo amplifier.EDIT: a few pages in the thread claim was made that the input buffer opamp must be fake as they don\\'t look like the official TI chip packaging.  Company chimed in a couple of days later saying they bought the ICs directly from TI.  And showed the purchase order proving the same.  It seems the \"internet got this wrong\" as far as what constitutes a fake as TI is using two different factories with different packaging.',\n",
       " ' Denon PMA-50 Audio (speaker) amplifier with included DAC and Bluetooth.  It is on kind loan from a member. It seems to be discontinued but when available, it cost US $599.  I see it on ebay and such from $370 to $450.The enclosure is more stout and nicer looking/feeling than a lot of products in this category:The volume control is large and nice feeling.  It works a bit odd though in that when you first turn it, it switches the display to volume level but doesn\\'t do anything with respect to changing the level.  You need to keep turning it to have it take effect.There is a headphone amp which I did not test yet.  May do that later.Back panel shows a nice suite of digital and analog inputs but no line out for the DAC:I performed all of my testing with USB and a bit with analog Aux input.Included mains power supply gets rid of the tangle of wires that comes with external supplies.Internally this is a \"DDFA\" design which means it accepts digital input and converts it to PWM for amplification. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI started my initial test with USB input to the amplifier and got this:While not state-of-the-art, performance is above average for amplifiers we have tested with respect to distortion:Using analog input degrades performance fair bit:We lose about 5 dB, mostly in elevated noise level.  Note the channel mismatch when you use analog input as opposed to digital.Frequency response using USB input and high sample rate of 192 kHz, shows the noise shaping/filtering of the digital amplifier:Young people with good hearing may hear some elevated sharpness.  Total bandwidth though is better than some other amps we have tested which truncate at 22 kHz and such.Looking at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone, we see a very well behaved amplifier despite being class-D:Ultrasonic noise is limited to -60 dB.  Some other products have peaks as high as -20 dB here.  There is a single spike at 840 kHz or so, which is likely the switching frequency.Note that I did not have to use my AES filter as I usually do with class D amp.  The analyzer was not confused by the ultrasonic noise as present.Using USB input we get very clean signal until the amp stops producing power:54 watts of power slightly beats the 50 watt specification into 4 ohm.  Alas, this is not much power, relegating the unit to office, small room use.As expected, power drops with 8 ohm load:I suggest getting a 4 ohm speaker to extract the max power out of the unit.Using analog input, we can compare the power at 4 ohm to other amps tested.  Here again, the gain was strange as turning it up to 0 dB, caused elevated noise and very early clipping.  So I dialed volume down and drove the unit to 2 volt input to get this:As we see, its modern competitors all have tons more power.The digital input though does better as we see in this IMD comparison:If the PMA-50 had more power, it would be a real contender here.Signal to noise ratio using USB input at nearly 5 watts and max power yielded this:We barely miss the spec at max power.  Even at 5 watt though, we are reasonably close to noise floor of CD/16-bit audio.  So not bad.ConclusionsThe Denon PMA-50 seems to be competently designed.  It has none of the performance quirks of cheap class-D amps.  It has a solid cabinet and controls to go with that engineering.The big knock against it is modest amount of power and high price relative to competition.  And in this day and age, lack of streaming support.I personally put huge value on power in amplifiers so can\\'t recommend the PMA-50 on that front.  But you have the data and can judge for yourself with your priorities.------Questions, comments, critique, etc. are welcome.The weather has warmed up and we are having a glorious, dry spring which is unusual for us.  The panthers have noticed the same and have been pestering me for a picnic lunch.  They may seem small in pictures but they have voracious appetite so I need money for food and drinks for them.

       " \" Marantz PM-90 Vintage stereo integrated amplifier.  It was purchased by a member from japan and drop shipped to me for testing.  It came out in 1991 with a price of 160,000 Yen (about $1,500 in today's exchange rate).  I looked online and I can only find one for US $950 but it is more beat up than this unit.I must say, this is one nice looking amplifier with a look that would fit in even today:The feel of the controls is excellent other than volume control which I found a bit loose.  A flip down door gives you additional control including switching between Class AB and Class A mode of operation!  Sadly it requires the unit to be powered down to change so no opportunity for instant switching and comparison.I was pleasantly surprised to see modern, beefy speaker terminals as well:Even more interesting is the inclusion of XLR balanced inputs for CD.This amplifier is back breakingly heavy due to use of two massive transformers.  It is at the limit of what I could lift and carry up two flight of stairs for testing.  Sitting here, my back aches just thinking about the reverse trip to pack the darn thing!  Speaking of packing, it was immaculately double boxed by Hifi-Do with zero impact to it despite the long journey.  Apparently it even came with one year warranty although you have to ship it back to Japan for that.Speaking of Japan, the unit is made for that market and hence 100 volt rating as opposed to 120 volts we have here in US.  If it were mine, I would go ahead and use it at 120 but being that of someone else's and hard to replace, I powered it by both my Lab AC generator and a Variac set to 100 volts.  This may have caused some measurement issues as I noted below.Marantz PM-90 Amplifier MeasurementsThere is a lot here to test due to dual mode of operation and dual type of input.  Let's start with Class A operation with RCA and then XLR:Unfortunately our measurements are polluted by high mains noise and harmonics.  I tried every which way but could not reduce that impact much.  Whether this is due design of the amplifier or longer AC mains connection due to use of lab AC gen or Variac, I can't tell.  As is SINAD doesn't appear to be better than modern AVRs with Marantz on their front plate:However, if we look at the FFT, we see only two harmonics and then it disappears into noise.  Here is the performance of Marantz SR7015 as a reference:Noise from power supply is lower there which aids it in getting similar SINAD.Switching to Class AB mode has no penalty:If anything distortion harmonics go a bit lower although that was not reliable.To see if there is a difference at all between Class AB and Class A, I turned on the residual mode of Audio Precision in the scope display.  This shows us the difference between input and output waveforms.  If there is zero crossing error due to class AB operation, we should see more difference around that part of the waveform but we don't:What is there is mostly power supply noise.  I changed frequencies, power level down to 1 watt and still saw nothing that would correlate with zero crossing distortion which class A is supposed to solve.  Feedback and class AB operation seem to have cured that ailment leaving little room for Class A to do better.Here is the comparison between Class AB and Class A again with respect to signal to noise ratio:Class AB pulls ahead in full power mode because it can create more power.  At baseline 5 watts they are similar likely limited by power supply noise.Crosstalk showed a tiny improvement in favor of class A but it is not material:Bandwidth is good but not exceptional:Notice how amplifier gain changes as you switch modes so for any listening tests, you may have to compensate for that.Class AB of course has tons more power:Overall shape of the graph is average.  Wanting to see the impact of the pre-amp vs power amp, I separated the two and fed the unit with my analyzer direct using RCA:As expected, my analyzer is cleaner but impact is on distortion, not noise which is a bit surprising.  As is one channel being worse than the other.   SINAD reaches almost 100 dB now near full power, good channel, which is very nice.There is a lot of headroom when using class AB vs Class A:Testing amplifier linearity vs frequency we get:Class A power limits more at 20 Hz than Class AB.  Both show very predictable and smooth responses which is great.Multitone tests shows slightly lower distortion at higher frequencies in favor of Class A:Effectiveness of feedback lowers at higher frequencies and likely this is the reason class A does better there.Marantz PM-90 Phono Input MeasurementsIt was hard to figure out a fair way to measure the performance of its phono stage to compare to stand-alone devices.  At first I used tape output but that didn't produce great response.  Best was from pre-amp tap to power amp:Sadly the mains noise is there and dwarfs SINAD.  There is no sign of harmonic distortion so that is very good.  Same situation exists for MC mode:RIAA equalization is probably the best I have measured:That story continues into headroom measurements:You get almost 12 volts of output before it starts to clip!  So pops and clicks should be much less noticeable.ConclusionsThe PM-90 does NOT show its age.  It produces above average performance compared to today's amplifiers.  It does so while running very cool and comfortable.  Not once did it get warm to touch or go into protection.  Push it hard and it just pulls back on the output but keeps going.  Clearly this is a very robust implementation.  Can it compete with state of the art amplification today in the form of Benchmark THX and Hypex/Purifi Class D amps?  No.  There is real innovation there to push down distortion and noise.  But we also have a lot of terrible amplifiers today which the PM-90 easily outperforms and does it with so much style.There is nothing to apologize for and a lot to praise for Marantz PM-90.  I hope the company goes back to these roots rather than horrible looks and performance of much of their AV line.On class A mode, I see no reason to recommend it and many reasons to avoid it.  If you run out of power there, you will certainly create audible distortion.  Whereas any benefit it might have is literally lost in the noise.I am happy to recommend the Marantz PM-90.\",\n",
       " \" XTZ A2-300 class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $500 from the company direct (which is located in Europe).  It is based on B&O ICE 300ASC or its newer name, 300A1.While you won't mistake the enclosure for A2-300 as a high-end, custom design, it has enough extra touches to set it above typical DIY type cases:There are some nice looking vents on the side.   Note however that all the heat is centralized in the center bottom panel as is typical of class D amp modules.  In use though, the bottom barely got warm although I could smell heat generation through side vents.I was disappointed to not see balanced inputs:The gain potentiometer will make the unit flexible but they are typically not good for reliability.  Since these controls don't get used often, then tend to go bad.  If you buy this unit, be sure to turn the control left and right once a few months.Binding posts are substantial which I liked.XTZ A2-300 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm:As noted, I adjusted the gain control to give me roughly 29 dB which is the standard value I use for my testing (and matches the THX recommendations).  Distortion is fairly low at -98 dB or so but there is enough noise to cost you 10 dB and a bit more in the other channel.  This makes SINAD still above average:As noted, noise is somewhat an issue and we can see that in signal to noise ratio:Notice how one channel is 3.5 dB worse than the other.I was a bit disappointed to see frequency response being impacted by my simple resistive load, showing peaking around 20 kHz:More complex speaker loads may make this worse (or better).  Crosstalk is OK:Here is our power level versus distortion+noise at 4 ohm:We see the same noise differential here and some distortion differential as well (although the latter is somewhat common).  Power is way short of 300 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% which is what the spec calls for, we are still shy of that:So definitely not conservatively rated.8 ohm load naturally produces a lot less power:Typical of ICE modules, they don't behave evenly across the frequency range:That is quite a variation in distortion and noise relative to power.  In some sense then our previous tests using 1 kHz are not as representative of the total performance.ConclusionsI started the review liking the enclosure.  But then got a bit more jaded with unbalanced only inputs, and higher than expected noise level, high frequency dependency on both frequency response and distortion+noise. Then again, performance is still above average compared to many amplifiers I have tested.  This produced a quandary for me.  I could recommend it and justify it.   At the end, I decided to not recommend it but without strong feelings one way or the other.  You have the data to decide for yourself.\",\n",
       " ' NAD C268 power amplifier with balanced inputs.  It is kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $900 at NAD dealers (not Amazon, etc.).  The C268 is built on Hypex UcD Class D amplifier modules so in testing it we will get coverage on that as well.  Then again NAD says it is a custom version for them.The front panel looks good and substantial:The unit is nice and light to move around and inside has fair amount of space.  Back panel is nice in the way it provides both balanced XLR and unbalanced RCA input together with gain control:For my testing I used the fixed gain mode to get around any channel differential the potentiometers may introduce.Speaker terminals are nice and easy to use and naturally the unit is properly certified for safety and emissions.  Keep the later in mind as you compare it with any DIY version of the same amplifier modules.  With anything with mains input, I highly recommend sticking with products with safety certifications.In use, the amplifier runs completely cool to touch.  Not even above room temperature it seems.  It never, ever shut down no matter what I did to it.  This is one of the reasons you buy a separate amplifier by the way.  These power amplifiers are far more robust than any in any home theater AVR.Stereo Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard where we feed the amplifier a simple 1 kHz sine wave/tone and ask it to produce 5 watts into 4 ohm load (typical for many speakers).  This is what we get:For some reason the channel in blue has much more second harmonic causing its SINAD -- which is a sum of distortion and noise -- to suffer by 5 dB.  There is always some differential between stereo channels but this is a bit much.  This aside, performance is above average with a SINAD of 87 dB once averaged (click on graph for larger size):Covering the basics, frequency response is very good:Crosstalk (one channel bleeding from one to the other) shape is unusual but fortunately it gives is near state-of-the-art performance where our hearing (more or less) is most sensitive:Noise performance is very good (much better than its distortion metric):You easily clear the CD/streaming content\\'s 16 bit dynamic range at almost any listening level.Getting fancy and using 32-tones to test for distortion/intermodulation we get what we already seen from the dashboard which is good:A power amplifier\\'s job is well, to produce power so let\\'s measure that starting with 4 ohm load:NAD rates the amplifier at 80 watts for both 4 and 8 ohm loads which is unusual.  Fortunately we are beating that with our 4 ohm load, getting 96 watts.As noted earlier, noise performance is very good as indicated by how low the red graphs are until distortion sets in and the graph starts to flatten and rise.  But then we hit a very hard wall at the end.  This is an amp that will sound good until it doesn\\'t.  You will instantly know its power limit for good or bad.There is some hidden good news here though.  Let\\'s measure power at 1% distortion+noise both continuous (like above) and burst:Wow, many switching amplifiers don\\'t produce much more power in burst mode.  Here, we are getting more than double the power to the tune of 230 watts while both channels driven!  This means for momentary musical peaks, you have much more power available than our standard non-burst tests show.Switching to 8 ohms we get what the company advertises:All of these power tests are at just one frequency: 1 kHz.  Let\\'s now run the same power sweep into 4 ohm load but vary the frequency:With class D amps, I expect these lines to have many different shapes and be all of the place.  Instead, they land right on top of each other which is an ideal response.  If you look to the right before clipping occurs though, you see that at the two ends of the spectrum -- 20 and 20,000 Hz -- power does get limited.  20 kHz doesn\\'t need much power as music spectrum is quite low.  But 20 Hz does and loss of power is unfortunate but very common.  The peaks at low frequencies last a while due to their slow \"speed\" (rate of change) which taxes the power supply causing it to run out of juice at lower power levels.Amplifier Bridged Mode PerformanceI usually don\\'t test bridged mode but knowing you rascals, you will immediately ask for it since NAD emphasizes this a lot.  So let\\'s reconfigure the amp into a single channel and see what we get:Company advertises 300 watts but that is likely at higher distortion than what I use in the above graph.  To approximate their performance, let\\'s use the 1% THD+N threshold again and measure again:Now we get the 300 watts continuous.  And better yet, we get close to half a kilowatt of power for peaks!  Nicely done.ConclusionsThe value proposition of the NAD C268 amplifier doesn\\'t look very good at first blush.  Just 80 watts per channel for $900?  Testing shows while that is more or less the continuous power level, for short duration the amplifier can provide far more power.  Combined with the nice and safe build quality, the C268 won my heart.As such, I am going to put the NAD C268 on my recommended list.',\n",
       " ' NAD M10 streaming amplifier and DAC.  It was purchased and drop shipped to me kindly by a member.  It costs US $2,749 from NAD dealers.The M10 sports a very large touch screen LCD display that covers the entire front face:Sorry for leaving the protecting plastic on.  Like to keep things as new as possible for members.As nice as the display is, it simply is not as responsive as your phone or tablet.  What could be really cool such as the VU meter mode, becomes a jittery display that doesn\\'t please much.  A much faster processor with GPU would be needed to really make the display the star.  Still, it is heads and shoulders above others that have small displays.The back panel is notable for inclusion of HDMI ARC input:Alas, I have no ARC capability on my workstation so could not test that feature.In normal use the plastic case barely gets warm.  Under heavy stress of power testing, it got somewhat warm making me wish the case was made out of aluminum than plastic.  You are not likely to push the switching amplifiers this hard and at any rate, the M10 runs much cooler than any Audio/Video Receiver.While I did not have time to test it, the M10 comes with Dirac Room EQ which is nice.I noticed one operational/design issue.  I unplugged the unit to take its picture but noticed that the display went crazy flashing random stuff.  I thought it was a capacitor that was discharging but this continued and would not stop!  I looked in the back and I realized I still had the HDMI cable plugged in.  Knowing that it provides a 5 volt \"hot plug\" signal, I disconnected it and the display finally shut down.  This is improper design.  The device must NOT draw any power out of HDMI connection.DAC Audio MeasurementsI connected the Coax output of my Audio Precision APx555 analyzer to the M10 and measured what came out of the pre-out with volume adjusted for 2 volt output:Distortion is quite low at -110 dB (near threshold of hearing) but the noise floor kept jumping up and down causing SINAD to vary with it.  This shows lack of isolation between sensitive DAC subsystem and busy processor running other functions of the device.  As it is, performance is respectable which is a sigh of relief:Anything in green and blue is good.Testing at other output levels shows that the M10 is capable of pumping out good bit of voltage:Dynamic range clears the bar for 16 bit CD/streaming content but not much more:IMD distortion versus level shows the same noise issue:Filter response also shows higher than it should be noise floor:Jitter and noise test shows a lot of unwanted tones but audibly they are below threshold of hearing:Linearity is very good:EDIT: forgot to include multitone in the original review:Finally, we see the penalty of the DAC filter not being sharp enough in distortion+noise versus frequency:Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI was hoping that analog input was not digitized but alas, it is:And at very low sample rate.  Maybe there is a setting to change this but I did not bother to look.Using the same analog input, I witnessed wild swings in noise floor of the unit:So I abandoned the analog input and switched to Coax for the rest of the amplifier tests:Performance is improved and stable as well.  This rates the M10 above average for more than 100 amplifiers tested so far:Signal to noise ratio is disappointing as even with full power, it barely clears the 16 bit hurdle:Frequency response using digital input is wide enough:But for those people with ultra sensitive high frequency hearing, you will lose half a dB at 20 kHz.Let\\'s see how much clean power we get out of M10 starting with 4 ohm load:I allowed the distortion to go higher (1%) and got even more power:I tried to get the burst power rating but some kind of limiter in the M10 was fighting the analyzer and wouldn\\'t allow me to get there.  It was nice that it would not shut down.Power naturally drops at 8 ohm:ConclusionsPerformance of the NAD M10 is generally acceptable especially for a multifunction device where we see a lot of fails.  Alas issues here and there took away my enthusiasm for it.  There is no excuse for poor analog input performance in a nearly $3000 device.  Or rather high and variable noise floor.So overall, I gave it a \"like it\" panther award but it is not something I would personally buy.  I can be stubborn that way!',\n",
       " ' Teac AX-501 integrated power (speaker) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The AX-501 is part of the reference series from Teac so doesn\\'t come cheap as desktop products go.  I see the price at USD $999 on Amazon plus $35 shipping.  There is a discount for silver a USD $899 but Amazon doesn\\'t sell it for some reason.When I reviewed the Teac HA-501 Headphone Amplifier, I heaped praise over its modern retro look.  The AX-501 takes that to an entirely different level with addition of a couple of super cute, yellow background VU meters:What is that?  I should have took the shot with the VU meters working and the light turned on?  Well, the owner played a cruel joke on me by not supplying me with the remote and leaving the setting to off for the VU meter!!!  The controls are almost as nice of the HA-501 with the exception of the volume control which feels a bit stiff and has some slack in it.  Otherwise, there is nothing to fault it as far as I am concerned.Here is the back panel:XLR inputs should be mandatory in this price range and I am glad to see then included here (that is the way I ran all of my tests).  The AX-501 uses a class-D amplifier and runs as cool as you could get in my testing.  I don\\'t think it ever got even warm.  Class D also means light weight and that is NOT the case here. The AX-501 is a very hefty unit for its size.  This means it stays put no matter how heavy your cables are.Notice the lawyers getting their hands on the unit as to indicate the class of speaker wiring you are supposed to use!  But hey, it is good to know the unit has been through corporate filter of certification and regulation.Even though Teac is a Japanese company, the AX-501 is made in China.Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard view using XLR inputs:Even though Teac specs the AX-501 at 1 watt, we see the same performance at 5 watts which is nice. Distortion and noise as stated in SINAD dB puts the AX-501 above average (of 74 dB):It loses to SONOS Amp using its digital input and ever so slightly outperforms the Amazon Link Amp.Signal to noise ratio matches company spec:Frequency response shows identical output for both channels which is a relief as poorly made class-D amps differ in this regard:Roll off is early for my taste.  I like to see flat response to 40  kHz. That said, early filtering seems to help bring stability to performance of the low cost class D amps and I saw that here as I measured power output:There is a broad operating range where performance is good between 1 and 30 watts.  We then run out of juice and clipping occurs at 88 watts.  Rated output is 100 watts although higher resolution measurement may have gotten us closer.The Amazon Link Amp has more power and SONOS even more.  You are guaranteed to hear distortion when an amp reaches its max power rating so on this all important metric, the Teac AX-501 loses to its cheaper rivals.  And of course we are worlds away compared to reference amps like those based on Hypex NC-400.I have added a new test to my power amplifier suite and that is intermodulation distortion relative to measured power.  I ran it against the recently reviewed Klipsch PowerGate Amplifier: We see more evidence of the stability and clean performance of Teac AX-501 as switched/class D amplifiers go.  The IMD graph is also more revealing of distortion set it around 7 to 8 watts and climbing before final clipping.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI ran a sampling of my headphone tests starting with power versus distortion using 300 ohm load:Wow, this is impressive amount of output power at such a high impedance.  I wonder if we are just looking at the output of the power amplifier, reduced with an in-line resistor.  Here is the results with 33 ohm load:Oh, this is not nearly as good.  The reason is this:Sadly, we have a high value resistor in series with the output to the tune of 58 ohm.  I don\\'t like to see a value much more than 10 ohm and ideally, down to 1 to 2 ohm.Best use would be high impedance headphone with relatively flat impedance graph versus frequency.  Otherwise some \"color\" will be imparted on the sound (for good or bad).ConclusionsPersonally I think Teac has nailed the look and feel of such a desktop product.  The AX-501 is in an entirely different class, rivalling Nagra when it comes to switch-gear and meters.  In that regard it is a \"bargain.\"The power amplifier seems competent without hairy corner cases.  It is above average in performance but not rising up to the levels I like to see for $1,000.  As I noted in the review. power is everything and there are much better choices in that regard such as SONOS Amp.  At nearly half the price, it delivers more than twice the power plus a bunch of other features such as included streaming/DAC.  It doesn\\'t look nearly as nice as Teac AX-501 though.The headphone output is a checklist item although it should sound very good with high impedance headphones (I did not test).The AX-501 runs cool and should be quite reliable and safe giving its pedigree.  Overall I \\'like\" the Teac AX-501 but can\\'t recommend it on performance or value.  We should be able to do better for $1,000 so the search continues.',\n",
       " ' Lexicon, first generation DD8, 8-channel amplifier.  It was purchased used by a member and drop shipped to me.  The DD8 came from collaboration of Harman with TI (chip company) to produce very low weight, switching amplifiers for BMW car audio system.  It was then later repurposed in this configuration for the Custom Integration (CI) industry.  It is actually rebranded by a number of companies and sold under their label. Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman products which includes Lexicon.  So keep potential bias in mind as you read this review.All 8 channels are provided in one compact, very cool running 1U rack mount chassis:A stout on off switch manages power duties together with heftiest relay sound you have heard!  The back will seem unusual for hi-fi market but is precisely what the custom integration channel needs:You can either feed the unit individually per channel or a \"bus\" input that feeds the same stereo input to all the channels.  The latter is very handy for \"whole house audio\" where the same music plays in every room from ceiling speakers and such.  A looped bus output is provided to cascade more of these units.Output is provided through phoenix connectors which again is common and desired in CI channel as they are secure but small connectors.  Individual gain controls are provided for every channel.  You can also select mono vs stereo (again, useful in whole house audio where you usually want mono).  And auto-sensing for channels not used.  Trigger is also provided of course.The available units are pulled out of existing installs so likely have many hours on them.  And if the installer didn\\'t know what he was doing, it may have been subjected to high temps.  Indeed the first unit the owner bought did not work right, changing its gain with temperature.  I traced it to the front-end of the unit.  So know what you are getting if you buy them used.Brand new, second generation DD8s cost US $3,500 (through dealer channels). This version listed for US $2,500.  I see them listed for $1,300 right now on ebay but I believe the owner was able to get it much cheaper.Lexicon DD8 MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard.  I set the gain to max which nicely gave me 29 dB which is what I have standardized on:This is above average performance with distortion kept below 100 dB;Noise performance is good as well:Ideally we would get 16 bits at 5 watts but 15 is a good effort.I was disappointed by the early cut off from the output filter:This is due to rather low switching frequency of 250 kHz (common values are in 300 to 400 kHz), which made the filter harder to design:Crosstalk is fine:Power into 4 ohm is rather low:The protection circuit was aggressive which made getting max and peak power difficult.  Still I managed to get some numbers:While we get more burst power courtesy of power supply designed for a lot more channels than two, max power with 1% THD+N still was rather low.I then tested the amp using 8 ohm and surprisingly, it produces more power there:To see how the power scales, I measured max power using two and four channels.  Both were the same using 8 ohm:Most disappointing was varying the frequency and producing a power sweep:As you see, there is huge penalty at higher frequencies.  Furthermore, there are power related linearities.ConclusionsIn mid to low frequencies, the DD8 produces well above average performance.  Above that frequency though, distortion increases substantially and other non-linearities surface.  Output seems to have some load dependency while also rolling off early.If you can get the unit for a few hundred dollars, then its compact enclosure and general performance may be a steal.  You could almost push me to recommend it but I am not going to.  I like to see better performance with respect to frequency response and high frequencies.   I think for its intended custom install market, it is perfect (our company has installed a lot of these).  For hi-fi use, you have to make that decision.',\n",
       " ' Outlaw 2200 single-channel amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 2200 costs US $399 plus shipping although I read that it goes on sale for less than that.I was surprised how svelte the 2200 is given its power capability:The diminutive size comes from \"class G\" implementation which varies the power supply with signal.  This sharply lowers the power loss at lower power levels allowing the heatsinks to be much smaller.   Despite its low \"1U\" height, the 2200 is heavy though courtesy of a larger pancake toroidal power transformer.It is always great to see balanced XLR input and trigger capability on amplifiers:In use, the 2200 was solid as a rock.  It never shut down or complain and ran very cool even after full suite of tests.  I was worried about recommendation to stack these from Outlaw but after testing, I think that can be done without much concern.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:SINAD is supposed to be sum of distortion and noise relative to our input signal.  Here, distortion is very low, approaching -105 dB.  So the fact that the SINAD is just 86 dB tells us that the number is dominated by noise as you will see shortly.  As it is, this is above average for some 75 amplifiers tested so far:Here is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and full power:Frequency response is a bit more limited than I like to see:Measured power at both 4 and 8 ohms exceed outlaw specifications:Even more power is on tap if you allow higher distortion or for momentary peaks:Wideband spectrum analysis shows very clean output:Those of you who are bothered by class D switching noise, should be happy to see this.  Indeed I performed all of my tests without an ultrasonic filter on my Analyzer.Thermal StabilityPerformance was rock solid from cold to operating temp:ConclusionsThe Outlaw 2200 monoblocks provides solid performance, easily besting the amps you get in a typical home theater AVR and then some.  Its slim packaging allows you to configure as many channels as you need without needing a lot of space.  Efficiency is good but doesn\\'t bring with it the light weight of the class D.  I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2200 amplifier.',\n",
       " ' Niles SI-2150 Class D amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  He purchased it refurbished and I see it for sale at $367.  Original cost seems to be US $850.By using efficient Hypex UcD250LP class D amplifier modules, the SI-2150 manages to fit in a small, 1U rack chassis:Niles is targeting this amp as Custom Integration (CI) channel so has good control as far as trigger and such:In use, the unit stayed cool and calm.  When pushed into clipping it will go into protection.  Sadly it stays in that mode until it is power cycled rather than recovering on its own.Nice set of gain controls are provided which lets you get precise channel matching -- something that is rarely the case in many amplifiers.  I set them to 29 dB for my testing.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone dashboard into 4 ohm load:SINAD which is the ratio of distortion and noise versus signal is better than average at 85 dB:Signal to noise ratio ranks in the same region:Frequency response is flat enough in audible band:Power into 4 ohm shows good noise and distortion:Lots of power is available if we allow the distortion to rise to 1%:Response into 8 ohm load is rather odd:Usually we have a declining graph with hard clipping in solid state amplifiers, not this gradual rise in distortion.  As such, it was not easy to determine the clipping point as I normally do.Typical of class D amps, the relationship with frequency and power is complex:Removing my ultrasonic filter allows us to see the switching spectrum of the amplifier:ConclusionsI am not sure at the regular list price but at refurbished cost, this is a steal of an amplifier.  Lots of power in a cool, small enclosure with above average distortion and noise.I am going to put the Niles SI-2150 on my recommended list.',\n",
       " \" Peachtree amp500 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,499.The amp500 comes in the same packaging of many previous Peachtree products. I wish company would innovate here as the design looks kind of dated. Then again it is very unique.  This amplifier comes with balanced inputs which I very much like:When I pushed the amp, the protection circuit naturally kicked it but unlike many other amps, recovered automatically without the need for a power cycle.The back half of the box is empty so the amp module is small.  And there is plenty of ventilation on top.  There was only modest temperature rise in the case post all the testing I did which is admirable.Peachtree amp500 MeasurementsThe amplifier was ready on power up:Dashboard measurement shows above average performance:Noise+distortion as embodied in SINAD is well above median although well sort of state of the art:I could not come close to matching company spec for SNR:Frequency response was flat enough and not dependent on impedance which is very good for a class D amp:Crosstalk was state of the art so I am assuming some kind of dual mono configuration:Multitone was respectable:Let's see how power it pumps into a 500 watt load:That is a lot of power!  The clipping is quite sharp though which when combined with the protection circuit, would not allow me to measure max power.  But I did get peak power:I think spec is 700 watts but we are close enough.  Even at 8 ohm we have good bit of power:High frequencies bother the amp but go lower and linearity is excellent:Finally, we have a new test: power on noise:I haven't run this test on other amps to know if this is good or bad.  Once I do get some mileage on it, we will better know what is going on.  If I were to guess, I would say this is good performance.ConclusionsStory here is simple: tons and tons of power with above average noise and distortion.  A cool running switching amplifier in small package as well.  Really, nothing much to complain about here.I am going to recommend the Peachtree amp500.\",\n",
       " ' Outlaw 2220 single channel amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $399.The look is simple but elegant in its slim form factor.  I like that it is just heavy enough to give you confidence but not so much that you can\\'t lift it.Nice set of features are provided from balanced XLR input to trigger.  A larger toroidal transformer indicates class class AB design (not switching).Outlaw 2220 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm:I like the very low distortion spikes that are around -108 dB or so.  Some power supply noise (120 Hz) and general noise lower SINAD down to 85 dB which is still quite competent:Noise level could be a bit lower at 5 watts but still respectable:Multitone test shows the very low distortion of the amplifier:Frequency response is flat which is an improvement over the 2200 model which drooped at 20 kHz:The word \"monoblocks\" sets up expectations of high amount of power and the 2220 delivers:This should be plenty of power for just about any use.Finally we can examine performance at different frequencies:Some strange distortion mechanism sets in at highest frequencies but only during a limited power range (hump in green).  Fortunately you hardly ever have content at high frequencies at high amplitude so not an audible concern.ConclusionsPerformance of the Outlaw 2220 is solid, solid, solid!  What can I say.  It delivers what you expect with nary any results that raise an eyebrow sans that high frequency distortion.  You have ton of power which should be handy for both stereo music listening and home theater.  At $399 it brings great value as well.I am happy to recommend the Outlaw 2220 monoblock amplifier.',\n",
       " ' all-in-one Marantz HD-AMP1 DAC and integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and retails for USD $1,100 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.The unit has a somewhat retro looking of other Marantz audio products with the round digital display and wood sides:There are both digital inputs and analog allowing one to build a complete system around the HD-AMP1.  I was surprised to not see RCA outputs though so no convenient way to use its internal DAC by itself.Amplification is through class-D technology which allowed the unit to run cool.  Without permission from its owner though, I did not put it through thermal stress.In addition to speaker output, there is also a headphone jack so I tested the output through that too.There is a lot of functionality in HD-AMP1.  I chose to test a few of them in this feature and will test more based on requests.MeasurementsI started by testing the DAC+headphone stage using our usual dashboard:As you see, I set the output to 2 volt which is the nominal output of stand-alone DACs.  Alas, performance is nothing to write home about.  Second harmonic distortion is quite high, setting the SINAD at just 85 dB.  This would put in the fourth quadrant of DACs tested (with one being the best).  We also have fair bit of harmonic spikes from the power supply from 180 Hz and up (multiple of 60 Hz mains frequency in US).Loading down the headphone output with 300 ohm, we get this:There are internal gain settings but I did not mess with them.  As it is, level of noise and distortion is quite high relative to desktop DAC+amp products.  Power output however is decent.Switching to the power amplifier, here is the power versus distortion+noise measurement:I have plotted three graphs using three different volume controls with input being swept up to 2 volts.  Distortion climbs less steeply than other amps so hard to know where to stop and measure the wattage.  I selected a conservative point and got 47 watts.  I believe the rating from Marantz is 70 watts using my 4 ohm load.    You could certainly get there and beyond if you tolerate more distortion.As I have noted, the performance is similar to budget amplifiers like NuForce STA-200 (dashed green) but not even remotely getting close to our best in class Hypex NC400 amplifier (dashed blue).  Best case performance is about SINAD of 72 dB or so.Above is with my 40 kHz AES-17 filter by the way.Frequency response was very good for a class D amplifier:And here is the broadband spectrum analysis of a 1 kHz tone:The first large spike comes at nearly 500 kHz which I am assuming is the switching frequency of its class-D amplifier.  Its second harmonic is at nearly 1 Mhz and down -60 dB.Finally, here is the harmonic distortion+noise versus frequency at 5 watts of output using 90 kHz of bandwidth:Once again, it is not on the same planet as the Hypex NC400.  It also has instability when the analyzer switches its frequency as indicated by the \"T\" symbols.  It takes some 5 seconds for the readings to become stable.  We saw this in the Behringer A500 amplifier review.ConclusionsI wanted to like the Marantz HD-AMP1.  It has been in demand for quite a while on the forum to measure it. Having done that, I see no signs of excellence. It follows the drifting backward industry trend of \"good enough\" performance specs.  This is reflected in lack of hardly any specifications provided by Marantz.  On feature side, it is very strange that there is no RCA outputs to use the DAC and pre-amp with a different power amplifier.Needless to say, I can\\'t recommend the Marantz HD-AMP1.',\n",
       " 'This is a follow up to my first test of the Cambridge Audio CXA81.  Results there showed fair bit of noise which was uncharacteristic of other products I have tested from the company.  There were a lot of speculation as to the source of the problem but no data to back any. Fortunately company CEO was kind enough to contact me about a week later expressing surprised at my results. I asked them if they have measurements that are better.  After some investigation, they said that they could replicate my results at their China manufacturing facility but not their R&D lab. I expressed that I no longer had the unit so there was not any work I could do to get to the bottom of this.  I was offered a new unit and offer for payment to test again. I accepted the second unit but turn down the offer of payment.In the communication, I was asked (as some members had also suggested) whether I lifted the USB ground using the switch in the back.  I had not and ran those tests on the second unit.  This is with the unit grounded:The low frequency noise was much lower in this sample but you can still see the channel in red showing a wide spectrum of high frequency noise.  This reduced its sinad fair bit compared to the \"good\" channel.  Lifting the ground made that better but created a new problem:At first it appears that there is more harmonic distortion given the spikes at 2, 3,4, 5, etc. KHz.  But that is not so.  USB micro packets are 1 Kbytes each and frame boundaries are showing up there as leakage from digital to analog circuits.  So lifting the ground is really not a good solution here although I appreciate it being there as it may help some systems.Post this we had a conference call with the designers of the product.  Issue was brought up that this is an instrumentation thing that the Audio Precision analyzer is creating a loop and ground noise that would not be there.  While this is true, I explained that I have tested hundreds of DACs that don\\'t have this problem.  I have once in a while seen this but it is exceptionally rare.  Since overall results were more positive than the first sample, I offered to re-run all the measurements and post them.A problem which we did NOT have a disagreement was, was the output limit of the pre-out.  Like many AVRs, this is lower than I like to see at 1.5 volt.  Above that it will saturate and distortion will increase.With this intro, let\\'s get into the measurements.  Company has seen all the measurements and agrees with them.CXA81 DAC Measurements (Sample 2)I wanted to break the electrical link between the analyzer and CXA81 so started my DAC testing using Toslink optical. Here is our dashboard:Note how I have picked the max output before output saturating.  If we sweep the input level we see the full range of output relative to distortion:As you see at 2 volts, we get down to SINAD of 75 dB which is what I measured with the first sample at that output.I next switched to USB input:We see noise intrusion reducing SINAD by a few dBs relative to TOSLINK optical.  Here is a key discovery though: this is NOT due to USB input but mere connection of USB cable.  You can see that noise even with Toslink when I have USB plugged in (but not used as an input):Turns out this noise issue will proceed to corrupt the measurements of all other subsystems and was the reason why the amplifier for example did not perform well either in the first round.  The impact with this second unit is lower than first sample though.  This could be due to noise conditions changing on my test system (nature of computers and grounding) or something is different in the second sample.To eliminate USB noise as a factor I continued the rest of DAC tests using Toslink so let\\'s go through them quickly:Linearity test was impacted by another rare issue which is power supply noise very close to the test tone of 200 Hz I use here.  There is a strong bandpass filter here but not enough to get rid of that:We see clear jitter sources but they are benign audibly:IMD test shows more noise than I like to see but is very good at the limit, beating my reference DAC in blue:Here is our reconstruction filter:And THD+N vs frequency:Pre-amp MeasurementsHere again we see the impact of connecting the USB cable or not while testing analog in/analog out:Power Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard:This is above average for all amplifiers tested to date and far better than noise-induced measurements of the first sample.  Distortion is at -100 dB which is very good.Power sweeps are much improved due to lower noise:We see that in various frequencies as well:The lower amount of noise allows distinction between the test tones.ConclusionsThe second sample combined with not connecting USB cable shows CXA81 in much better light.  Performance is competent now for the class and transparent for most uses.  Where would one put the blame for noise being induced using USB?  Me? Instrumentation? Vagueness of computer audio/grounding?  Some or all of the above?  When testing AVRs, I have started testing with Toslink to remove issues related to HDMI.  I should have opted to do the same here but did not since I consider the unit in a different class.  Still, I take some blame and should have done this before returning the unit. As I expressed to the company though, this is not a problem that other devices have so I implore them to investigate how to use this variability. After all, your system may be much worse than my configuration as your downstream devices and upstream computer may present even a worse situation. One likes to take comfort in thinking \"one digital input is the same as another.\"As it is, you have the tough situation that you can\\'t leave USB cable connected lest you degrade the performance of the rest of the system.  If you don\\'t have an audible issue, this is not a concern but if it is, experiment with removing USB cable and see if fixes the problem.For me personally, USB connection is critical and about the only input I would use on such a combo device.  So the above is not something that works for me.  But may be fine for you.I also like to see output levels of 2 volts for unbalanced without saturating.  We are seeing AVR/AVP companies going this way.  No reason to do different in a combo device like this.  Higher output level gives better freedom to use external amplifiers.Finally, let me express my sincere and deep appreciate for Cambridge Audio and company CEO for accepting the challenging results of the first test and working with me on better clarity and a constructive path forward.  In that regard, they earn highest levels of respect from me.  I look forward to quality products from them that come across my bench.',\n",
       " ' Allo Volt+ D class D amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $129 in this \"dual mono\" configuration with stepped attenuator.I am not a big fan of these clear cases but in this case, pun intended, it works!Hard to take a picture of it though without heavily accentuating dust and such that normally is not visible:Dual TI TPA2116 class D amplifiers are used plus a front-end switching power supplies to generate the required plus and minus supplies.Not that no power supply comes with this amplifier.  You have a choice of what you put in there.  I used my lab power supply at its max setting of 31 volts and 3 amps.  It could use more than 3 amps with 4 ohm load as the power supply current limited near max power sweeps.  It was fine with 8 ohm load though as that doesn\\'t need as much current.There is no remote control so this is really a desktop amplifier.  There is a gain switch below that switches between 19 and 26 dB.  I used the default 19 dB which works well with desktop DACs that have no trouble producing near 2 volts you need for max power.Overall the Volt+ D makes a very positive impression with respect to looks and build quality.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is nice!  Budget class D amps routinely produce SINAD in 55 to 65 dB and here we are well above that at 84 dB:I was also impressed with how low the noise floor was at 5 watt playback:Many amplifiers fail to achieve 96 dB which is my target for this level of playback.Crosstalk is superb, better than just about any amp I have tested recently:Frequency response has a tiny bit of roll off at 20 kHz:As I noted in the introduction, with 4 ohm load my power supply lacks enough current so I also tested with one channel driven:So it seems that getting the 60 watt advertised power level is possible.Taking advantage of onboard capacitors, I ran my burst test:So even in stereo you have over 60 watts, going to nearly 90 watts with one channel.Power into 8 ohm load is naturally lower:Notice that noise floor is very low contributing to very good response at lower power levels.Varying the frequency gives us the following power levels and distortion:At or below 1 kHz response is excellent and frequency independent.  Above that it varies which is typical of many class D amps.Finally, I ran a spectrum analysis without my usual class D amp filter in the path:Wow, TI put some clever filtering/design in there.  Usually the switching frequency is down just 10 to 2 dB from our main tone.  Here, nothing rises above -88 dB or so!  TI advertises that the amp will not interfere with AM radio and it definitely won\\'t.ConclusionsThe Allo Volt+ D amplifier is a delightful surprise.  Careful design has elevated the performance of these switching \"chip amplifiers\" to that of mass market hifi/class AB designs.  Yet, it runs cool and costs very little.  Yes, you need an external power supply and that is the only flaw I see with going with this solution.  Overall, I am happy to recommend the Allo Volt+ D for its nice and elegant design and performance especially at this price.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of Amazon Echo Link Amp power amplifier, DAC and network streamer.  I purchased this from Amazon for USD $299 and it arrived yesterday.While rather featureless from front, the overall feel of the plastic and case is quite good:When you rotate the volume control white LEDs light up to show a coarse volume control.  They time out very quickly though so I could not capture them on the camera.Not sure what the hole is for.  Maybe it is for a remote control but none was provided.The back panel is the more interesting bit:In addition to the power amplifier, we have a nice little DAC and pre-amplifier here.  There are digital inputs in the form of both Coax and Toslink S/PDIF.  And of course we also have streaming capability with the Ethernet jack and wifi.  Surprisingly we also have S/PDIF and Toslink output for digital connectivity to other DACs and amplifiers.There is analog input and output.  Former can be used for your analog gear and the latter, for use as a DAC or pre-amp.  There are issues with this mode though.  See later in measurement section.Operationally the Link Amp runs very cool.  However at higher power there is an audible mechanical hissing sound likely caused by resonance of an internal inductor.  It was audible to me from 3 feet away without use of speakers (dummy loads).As you can imagine for a product with Amazon name of it, there is a professional looking label underneath with every regulatory and safety certification you would want to see.  This is important as the Link Amp like many other power amplifiers is mains operated with a lot of high power circuits.  Oddly there is no power button.Sadly there is hardly any documentation provided with the unit.  You are supposed to seek help in the Alexa app.  I naively assumed that connecting ethernet cable would mean the Link Amp wout get instantly recognized by the app but such was not the case.  I had to configure it using Wifi with the mess that is: connecting to local ad-hoc wifi it creates and then using the main home network.  Process was quite non-intuitive and took multiple reboots of phone and link amp to get it to finally recognize it.  Boy, do I miss the simplicity of the original echo.  Oddly, Alexa app provides no control over inputs!  I just fed it S/PDIF and it output that. Ditto for analog.  Can't tell what priority it will use if both are active.There is a volume control in the app but it only controls local/streaming content, not the volume control on the Amp.  Really?  The volume control is digital so why can't I control it in the app???Amazon has really lost its way here with respect to software here.  Added complexity over time has not been managed.Also at fault is the computer and networking industry that has not invented a new revision of Wifi standard that just works with devices like this.Overall, my impression of hardware is positive and software negative.Anyway, let's get into measurements.  With so much functionality here, I have chosen a subset to test, mostly focusing on the amplifier performance.DAC MeasurementsI was happy to see line out so thought we can check the performance of the DAC this way.  Alas, this was not meant to be as without a load, the amplifier shuts down when you turn up the volume to max to get the nominal voltage you like to see on a DAC.  There should be a software option to turn off the power amp so it doesn't do that.  So I had to connect my dummy loads to the amp to test it.  Here is the outcome:The power amplifier reduced performance by about 5 dB. SINAD was 92 dB or so without the load.  The current values put the Link Amp in the lower tier of DACs tested:It would have gone into a tier higher if I didn't have to run the power amplifier along with it.Here is the DAC frequency response which was promoted by later test results:The 44.1 kHz sampling results are fine.  What is not fine is that no matter what other sample rate you use, you get the same bandwidth!  In other words, while higher sample rates are accepted, everything seems to be down sampled to 44.1 or 48 kHz.  So forget any dreams you have of high resolution audio.Power Amplifier MeasurementsImportant note before we get into this section: during testing the results were a complete mess at lower frequencies.  The graphs were literally not readable with very high variations of THD+N.  So I spent a few hours with my son working through it and turned out some of these class-D amps cause frequency modulation at low frequencies which throws off the analyzer notch filter.  The result was that THD+N would go from correct value to 20%+ which would totally screw things up on the graph.  I found a good work-around for this which made the measurements look a lot nicer.  Alas, this means you can't quite compare these results to previous measurements where this issue was visible.  Fortunately we had very clean amplifiers such as Hypex NC400 without this issue so those results stand.Let's start with power amplifier dashboard st 5 watts using digital input:When I tested the SONOS Amp there was a lot of degradation with analog input so let's test that:Ah, a sigh of relief.  Performance actually improves a bit using analog in!  Noise floor is flatter and lower although not enough to make the SINAD any different.  Putting that value in context of other power amplifiers tested, we get this:I updated this graph with the digital input of SONOS which nicely outperforms the Link Amp.  However, as noted with analog input the Amazon Link Amp is much better.Frequency response with digital input shows the same bandwidth limitation that the DAC did:Same test with analog input shows a droop at low frequencies as well:Note that even when using analog input, you are limited to the same 24 kHz bandwidth!  Someone didn't want you to mess with high resolution audio no matter what.  That aside, there is now a low frequency roll off too.Here is the signal to noise ratio:Let's deal with the most important test: power output versus distortion and noise:Compared to other budget amps like the $199 Topping TP60, there is much more power here and at lower noise and distortion.  Don't like one channel having more distortion though.A more direct competitor is the SONOS amp which costs twice as much but otherwise has streaming functionality:The Link Amp has better noise level but that is because SONOS has poor performance with its analog input.  The SONOS has tons more power and its two channels are staying in synch.  So the SONOS is a better deal here putting the cost aside.  Of course neither comes remotely close to our reference Hypex NC400 DIY build (at > $1,000).There has been some interest in running jitter tests on these power amplifiers.  So here is a snapshot of that:The THD+N versus level and frequency where my new tests show much cleaner results:Note that I have limited the bandwidth to 61 kHz. That is enough to capture the third harmonic of 20 kHz but low enough to keep the ultrasonic noise that these amps have.  I will show that in a bit.  Here we see that distortion rises with low and high frequencies.  The curve though matches how our hearing works in that we are much less sensitive in low and high frequencies so the distortion products are likely not audibly a problem.  Note then that testing at 1 khz shows the best case scenario for these class D amplifiers.I have another variation of above where I sweep the level/power and keep the frequency the same:We see that at 20,000 Hz, the two channels perform the same.  But as soon as we lower the test to 2,000 Hz and then 200 Hz, one channel gets a lot worse. This tells me there is insufficient power supply capacitor reserve for one channel than for the other.  The lower frequencies are more taxing this way because they stay at their extreme peaks of the sine wave longer.Lastly, here is our ultrasonic spectrum of a 1 kHz tone:We see our sharp spike around 600 kHz indicating that is the switching frequency.  The rise in ultrasonics around 100 khz shows noise shaping (pulling noise out of audible band and stuffing it here).  Levels for these are quite low as class-D amps go, showing good attention to filtering, no doubt helped with the limited bandwidth of 24 kHz.ConclusionsMechanically and from safety and emissions point of view, Amazon Echo Link amp delivers for just $299.  This puts it way ahead of many offerings in this price range which are more akin to DIY efforts than a polished product.  On top of that, you have streaming, DAC and a digital and analog pre-amplifier.  This is a lot and I suspect Amazon is losing money on each one or barely breaking even.While some attention has been paid to produce a performant product, there are clear limitations and issues here and there.  Limiting of the bandwidth to 24 khz in all modes is a miss objectively but not subjectively.  As with other class D amps, we have odd behavior here and there such as rise in low frequency distortion, ultrasonic noise.The mechanical whistling while the amp is pushed should have been caught and fixed although in practice, the music should mask that well.At $299 with so many features and generally good performance, I am going to go ahead and put the Amazon Echo Link Amp on my recommended list.  No, it is no audiophile find.  But for secondary use its performance is good enough to make it a good buy.\",\n",
       " \" Peachtree GAN400 stereo balanced (input) amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,499.I am not generally a fan of peachtree audio product looks but this one in coffee stain looks pretty good.  Other than a power switch, not much else is there.  Ditto on the back side:The claim to fame of this amplifier is use of GaN transistors which in theory simplify the design of a class D amplifier (a bit) and improve its efficiency (a bit).  And in theory, it can also produce lower distortion (in open loop anyway).  The drawback is much higher cost of the transistors compared to MOSFETs.  Let's see if the performance is there.Peachtree GAN400 MeasurementsI performed all of my testing using XLR input.  Let's start with our usual input of 1 kHz with output into 4 ohm to the tune of 5 watts:There is fair bit of inconsistency between the channels with respect to SINAD.  I switched my loads and issue persisted so it is not my setup.  Averaging the two we get 84 dB which is slightly average for all amps tested but not where performance should be:Frequency response is disappointing as it shows load dependency:This means that the high frequency response will be speaker dependent which is not good.  I expect this kind of performance in ultra budget amplifiers (under $100), not at this price.Noise performance is good but again, not where it should be:Same for multitone distortion:Crosstalk however, is superb indicating two independent amplifiers:There is lots of power both at 4 and 8 ohms:As noted though, the curve starts to go up prior to clipping which means distortion is increasing.The amplifier more than meets its 400 watt spec at 1% THD:The shape of THD+N graph is very smooth which perhaps could be attributed to GaN transistor design:There is no pop on power up but there is when you shut it down:The amp is stable on power up so no need to leave it on:Peachtree GAN400 Power Stress TestWith the owner's permission , I subjected the amp to varying load angle (phase) and down to 2 ohm impedance.  It did very well:Variations of ±60 degrees did not bother it at all at either 4 or 8 ohm.  A bit strangely, at 2 ohm it would not run with 0 load angle but did produce half the output at other angles (hard to see in the 3-D graph).  Since minimum impedance is 2.5 oh, we can't fault it for this.  FYI I tested a couple of amps at my disposal and the both got quite unhappy with varying phase angles, shutting down and such.  Whereas the GAN400 marched through this test without once going into protection.ConclusionsI just bought a 65 watt GaN based USB-C charger and am amazed at how small it is.  The buzz from there has travelled to audio and has resulted in GaN based amps like this Peachtree.  Alas, there is no performance advantage that can be seen in this implementation.  Noise+Distortion is only slightly better than average and far cry from top performing amplifiers we have tested in the past.  Combine this with quite high price of $2,500 and this is a difficult offer to swallow.  Good news is that there is plenty of power at 400+ watts independent of the load (4 or 8 ohm).Personally I don't see a reason to pay so much for this level of performance so I can't recommend the Peachtree GAN400 amplifier.\",\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A07 Pro stereo amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs about $90.As you see the distinguishing factor from some of the other Aiyima amplifiers is inclusion of tone controls. Alas, that is also where the problem is with this unit: there is no detent and no way of setting its response to flat. Worse yet small changes in the dials will make large differences in tonality. So while I like having toner controls, I definitely like to see a tone defeat feature.  Otherwise the unit feels nice to use and operate.  As is typical, the power supply is much larger than the amplifier itself:AIYIMA A07 Pro MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into a pure 4 ohm load, driven to stereo at 5 watts:We expect good performance from AIYIMA and we get it:Switching to my PowerCube Loadbox, we can simulate more complex loads: (1 channel tested)As you see, performance is essentially the same.Noise performance is good enough for this class of budget amplifiers:Multitone shows good performance:Frequency response unfortunately is load (speaker) dependent:So you may be forced to use the treble control to adjust high frequency response for your speaker.Crosstalk is very good:Let's get into all important power measurements starting with 4 ohm:This is plenty for desktop use.  Switching to 8 ohm naturally robs us of fair amount of power:Fortunately vast majority of speakers on the market are 4 ohm nominal.To see stability of the amplifier, let's subject it to suite of loads and reactive components:An ideal amplifier would follow the red line.  We are essentially there for both 8 and 4 ohm.  Surprisingly this little amp managed to also keep running at 2 ohm, albeit without capacitive component and some power drop.  Many amps simply shut down and won't even work into 2 ohm.Edit: here is the response vs frequency that I forgot to post originally:Finally, here is the warm up profile:In use, the amplifier ran pretty cool.ConclusionsThe AIYIMA A07 Pro continues the tradition of the company providing competent levels of noise and distortion, good bit of power and very reasonable price.  While tone controls are a nice added feature, they lack a defeat switch.  And we have our usual load dependency.Personally I very much dislike the lack of tone control defeat so won't buy it.  But if that doesn't bother you, then the AIYIMA A07 Pro is another good bargain in stereo amplification.\",\n",
       " ' Peachtree Nova 300 integrated amplifier with DAC and phono stage.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2,199.  The Nova 300 fits in the same chassis Peachtree has successfully used for last 15 years:It is quite beefy and heavy.  Volume indication overloads the LED indicators on the input selectors showing a coarse 8 levels.  For this price, I would expect an LED indicator of the actual level.Back panel shows good quality connectors and rich feature set for a desktop amplifier:Peachtree made its name on DACs and had quite a following 10 to 15 years ago.  I was curious to see if they had upgraded the DAC subsystem since that time so let\\'s start by measuring that subsystem.Peachtree Nova 300 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit over USB input, sampled the output from preamp out and adjusted the volume to output 2 volts:Well, this is quite disappointing.  Noise and distortion as represented by SINAD is in decidedly \"poor\" category in today\\'s market:The unit can output higher levels so let\\'s see where peak performance is:No luck there as the peak is actually at 1 volt out.Dynamic range is better indicating distortion is the problem:At this point I didn\\'t see a need to run more DAC tests and switched to testing the amplifier.Peachtree Nova 300 Amplifier MeasurementsFor this test I used the Aux analog input:Ah, this is very respectable and above average performance:SNR is not as good as I like at 5 watt but gets better at full power:Crosstalk is excellent:Frequency response shows a peaky filter though:Multi-tone results indicate \"good enough\" performance:What was most impressive is the amount of power available from the ICE amplifier module they are using:Since I am driving two channels, this is over 900 watts of power!  Indeed the peaks hit 1000+ watts:Even at 8 ohm there is copious amount of power available:Interesting to see little dependency on frequency until we hit a few watts:ConclusionsIt is clear from the measurements that the DAC subsystem is a relic that is simply behind times.  The product though benefits from using a competent B&O ICE module which has stayed competitive producing far more power than you would expect in a \"lifestyle\" product of this kind.  As such, I expect subjective performance of Nova 300 to be excellent regardless of what speaker you attach to it.  I usually don\\'t worry about price/performance in my reviews -- that is yours to worry about.    But here, the price seems quite high relative to the other internet focused amplifiers which have come out in the last couple of years.  Some of those are powerful and all of them cost a lot less than the Nova 300.Overall, I can\\'t recommend the Peachtree Nova 300 as a new purchase.  ',\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio BT20A stereo class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 IC. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $99.99 with 32 volt power supply.Despite its low cost, the case gives a feeling of quality. I am not usually fan of tone controls in low cost amps because you can never set them to flat response (the detents are there but don\\'t work). As you will in the measurements, Fosi has made sure that they work correctly in this instance.  A stout power switch controls power. In addition to 32 volt supply, company also shipped the optional ($40) 48 volt supply which is quite a giant:As you see, Bluetooth input is also supported.FYI there is an included orange volume control knob to give the unit some color.Fosi Audio BT20A Pro MeasurementsThe tests are in 48 volt unless I say otherwise (I had mistakenly assumed it was the standard, not the 32 volt).  Here is our dashboard:Notice the great channel match in addition to very good SINAD which represents noise and distortion.  Same is true with 32 volt supply:This nicely lands the BT20A Pro in the \"very good\" category of all amplifiers tested regardless of price:Zooming in to see the competition:SNR is good for the class:I expect load/impedance dependency in this class of switching amplifiers but here, the peaking is almost entirely out of band which is good:Seeing how you have tone controls anyway, you could tailor any peaking with adjustment of the treble control.  Won\\'t be exact but should be good enough.That aside, note how the response is more or less is flat in audible band with the treble and bass controls set to their detent, center position.Multitone is good enough for the class:Crosstalk is very good:Let\\'s start our 4 ohm power measurements with 48 volt supply:Wow, this little box can pump out some serious watts, albeit in the short term testing!  Switching to 32 volts cuts this down even though 4 ohm is mostly current limited:The larger power supply must have more capacitor reservoirs than the 32 volt.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally see the biggest hit to power: [Edit early version had the wattage wrong]Although to be fair, I put the cursor at an earlier point than for 48 volt supply (not enough measurement points there).I was pleasantly surprised by the transfer function being so smooth:Finally there is not much of a pop on but there is for off:ConclusionsThe TI TPA3255 seems to be a capable platform when paired with a good implementation which is what we have in BT20A Pro.  You get a sense of that in company marketing material which includes Audio Precision measurements.  Usability is excellent with high quality case and controls especially with respect to ability to set the tone controls to flat.It is also nice to see so much power coming out of this little box with the beefy 48 volt power supply, showcasing the advancements in amplification density we have today.As an aside, the company has been a joy to work with.  They were exceptionally polite, cordial and patient as I went through my testing and evaluation.  They tell me they have internal R&D team and it shows.I am happy to add the Fosi Audio BT20A Pro to my recommended list.',\n",
       " ' IOTAVX SA3 integrated stereo amplifier with built-in DAC and subwoofer output.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  It costs £399.00 (on sale from £449.00) on company\\'s website.  Hard to find it on sale in US but found one ebay listing for $498.SA3 nails the industry design with svelte chassis, dot matrix display and judicious use of backlighting for the logo: I left the plastic on the display as otherwise it looks nicer than it does in the picture.  A reassuring power button is the left and a nice feeling rotary control handles the volume.  If you press it, it becomes an input selector.  Very nicely done.Back panel shows a lot of inputs:There is phono input which I did not test.  I did test both analog input and Toslink digital input.  Sadly there is no USB input.  There is bluetooth but no streaming support over network.Let\\'s get started by using the line in (analog) input to the power amp and work our way out to the DAC section.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWith integrated amplifiers with volume controls, I adjust that to produce roughly 29 dB of gain which is a THX \"standard.\"  That gives us this dashboard:Distortion dominates with second harmonic telling the full story.  Wish channel 2 was as good as channel 1 but this is typical.  Averaging the two we get this kind of ranking:So above average among 89 amplifiers tested so far (!).  But not state of the art by any stretch.Noise performance is good:You almost clear the CD\\'s 16-bit dynamic range at 96 dB at 5 watts output.Typical of class AB designs, bandwidth is abundant:Should the zombie apocalypse come, you can hook up a few hundred yards of wire to the speaker wire and have yourself an AM transmitter power amp!!!  A microphone and simple modulator and you could be talking to people thousands of miles away at night....Crosstalk is surprisingly good:If you look inside the chassis, you realize why.  A toroidal transformer is in the middle with each amplifier nicely separated from each other by good 8 to 10 inches.Power output at 4 ohms falls a bit short of the spec:And I am not too happy about the constant rise in distortion from just 1 watt, ending worse than one of our worse performing Audio Video Receiver (the NAD T758).It is a bit happier driving an 8 ohm load:That\\'s not a lot of power though so best get an efficient speaker is 8 ohm is the language it speaks.Fortunately burst power is quite decent (only 4 ohm shown):Changing the frequency of the test tone hardly bothers the SA3:Other topologies such as Class D make a mess out of this measurement.DAC Audio MeasurementsTaking advantage of the pre-amp output, I fired off a few DAC tests to get an idea of how good that subsystem is starting with our digital dashboard:OK, this is a bit disappointing.  You want a SINAD here that is 10 dB better than the amp for it to be transparent.  Here it is actually a couple of dB worse then the amplifier which means the combo will drag down the performance of the amplifier some.As a DAC, it falls in the failing (red) category of all DACs tested to date:Noise performance is decent:Intermodulation+noise test is disappointing:The upper line in orange is a phone dongle!  The SA3 hugs that performs like it is related to it which it should not be.Jitter performance looks better than it is due to high noise floor potentially hiding other spurious tones:So overall the DAC portion is barely a match for the amplifier.  If the amp gets the grade B, the DAC gets a C+.ConclusionsIt is nice to see a fresh take on the integrated stereo amplifier from IOTAVIX.  The SA3 looks attractive, has good feature set including many inputs from digital to analog and takes up little space. You can nicely put it under your monitor, add a couple of speakers and be in business.You don\\'t get to brag its measured performance but what is there \"is not broken\" which is often an accomplishment in world of audio.  Performance is solid across the board with the DAC trailing a bit.  I would happily use it in a secondary system.Overall, I am going to recommend the IOTAVIX SA2 amplifier.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of Living Sound Audio Electronics Voyager GAN 350 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US 3,000 from the company.I really like the high-end look of this amplifier case:Strange though as there is no power indicator, nor switch.  The latter is in the back only:I really dislike the hard to read type on the back.  Other than that, the connectors seem to be of good quality.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses GaN transistors to ostensibly lower distortion and increase efficiency of the amplification.  In use, the bottom where all the modules are mounted barely god warm so efficiency is good.LSA Voyager GAN350 MeasurementsI started my testing with XLR inputs which showed really odd results:As you see, the gain is nearly 10 dB different between the channels.  I looked for configuration switches but couldn't find anything.  After wasting half hour, I switched to RCA input and problem vanished:If I were to guess I would say the XLR input is miswired on one channel.  Bad execution if so in such an expensive amplifier.  For the rest of the test I stuck with RCA input.Signal to noise ratio while OK, is not state of the art:I like to see full 16 bit/96 dB dynamic range at 5 watts.  We fall short here.Frequency response was sad to see:Class D amplifiers have a low pass filter that can interact with the load if not designed well and that is what we have here.  The impact falls clearly in audible band.  This would be OK for a budget amplifier in $100 range but not in this class.  Depending on what speaker you hook up to this amplifier, the highs may be exaggerated or filtered.Crosstalk on the other hand was exceptional due to dual mono design and no crosstalk through the power supply:Multitone performance was also very good, indicating low intermodulation distortion:Power was healthy into 4 ohm albeit with unexceptional distortion and noise levels:There is still plenty of power available even into 8 ohm:Interesting how distortion keeps rising and clipping is rather soft.  As they state, this indicates low amount of negative feedback.Transfer function is frequency dependent with distortion rising quite a bit at higher frequencies (likely due to that low feedback level):Spectrum of switching frequency shows good attenuation but not that high of a frequency:If they had opted for higher speed which GaN transistors allow, the impact of the output filter would have been lower (and possibly above audible band).The amplifier doesn't need any warm up as it is stable on power on:ConclusionsOther than having a lot of power and good efficiency, there is not much else to be happy here.  Clearly companies are using GaN as a buzzword without fully taking advantage of what it can provide.  Lots of money is left on the table here in many areas from frequency response load dependency to high amount of distortion.  At the end of the day, you have an expensive, high power amplifier here with average performance.I can't recommend the LSA Voyager GAN 350.  Performance is not there, nor is quality control.Edit: teardown just posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...a-voyager-gan-350-teardown-class-d-amp.28208/\",\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier with Bluetooth support. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $139.99.It is so nice to see a VU meter on an amplifier!  This one actually seems high quality with nice ballistic response (fast jump, a bit slower retard). Bass and Treble controls are there but I wish there was a tone defeat as well. The position of the indicators is where I had to set them for more or less flat response. I do like the very fine detents on it, allowing you to more precisely adjust them at least.The included power supply is one of the largest I have seen but is rather light for its size:There are no remotes so the amp is for desktop use.  Class D implementation means the amp ran with no temperature rise even after all my tests. Protection circuit was excellent with automatic restarted after overload. The meter is useful in this regard as the amp shuts down when the meter is almost at the end of its range.AIYIMA A08 Pro MeasurementsI warmed up the unit for about 10 minutes with very stable response:Running our dashboard we see the usual good performance from AIYIMA amplifier range:Performance is above average despite the very low cost:Noise level falls in the same category of very good:As noted, there was a bit of a struggle to get flat response:And typical of their designs, there is load dependency.Crosstalk was above average for all amplifiers tested:Multitone performance was very good:This little box outputs good bit of power at 4 ohms:Even with 8 ohm load you have good bit of it:Transfer function (frequency vs power) is pretty good for class:ConclusionsAIYIMA has a good class D platform which they turn into various configurations with good success.  The A08 Pro is no exception.  You get unique looks and to some extent, functionality at still a very reasonable price.  With 100 watts per channel, both driven, you have very nice capability to drive any desktop speaker to its limit.  My own wish is the remedy of the load dependency but otherwise, this is a job well done.I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A08 Pro stereo amplifier.',\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A07 desktop amplifier based on TPA3255 class D amplifier chip.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  The cost is US $72 on Amazon including prime shipping.  And as of this shipping, it also included a 32 volt, 5 amp switching power supply.  Member also purchased and sent me a 48 volt/3 amp power supply which I also tested.The case is standard budget audio affair:The volume control feels cheep but does the job.  The back panel terminals were way too small for my binding posts:The DC input socket was quite stiff especially with the 48 volt power supply.  Tightness is not a bad thing as far as power transfer is concerned but this was a bit too stiff.  Here are the two power supplies:They both feel kind of cheap as they would be at these prices ($21 for the 48 volt one).  Personally I would not leave these plugged in permanently if I am not around.  The included power supply has a two-pronged AC cable that was not polarized.  Rotating it around made a small difference in mains leakage.AIYIMA A07 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohms:As you see in the FFT display, there is considerable amount of mains leakage at 60 Hz.  This tends to be a function of switching power supplies.  I played with grounding and improved it a lot in one channel but not in the other (not shown).  SINAD did not get impacted since it is bound by distortion harmonics.  As it is, performance is above average:Signal to noise ratio is not great due to the mains hum:Frequency response is well behaved, albeit with a slight droop at 20 kHz:Crosstalk is good and well above bargain basement desktop amps:Power is everything in a small amp so let's see how we do with 4 ohm load:As expected, with low impedance of 4 ohm we are current limited so the 5 amp stock power supply does better, turning in 77 watts.  Yes, the 300 watt rating is a fantasy but maybe it can do better with momentary peaks.  Alas, its aggressive protection circuit would shut it down and not let me test max and peak power.Naturally the higher voltage power supply does better with 8 ohm load where we become voltage limited:Sweeping power vs frequency and distortion shows a very well behaved class D amplifier:ConclusionsTraditionally these desktop amplifiers have produced really poor performance in the form of noise and distortion.  Not so anymore.  These TPA3255 based amps seem to have good bones in them, producing above average performance for peanuts.  Alas, you are saddled with two boxes and cheap and potentially non-safety compliant parts.  For desktop use, these are probably acceptable compromises.  I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A07 based on its performance.And with this, our last review of 2020 comes to an end!  Nice that it is ending on a happy note.  \",\n",

I only see one used one on ebay for $2100 which seems pretty expensive for an old amp.  Then again Linn is a high-end audio company so maybe it holds its value?EDIT: member feedback shows prices are really in US $600 range for used units.Despite the high channel count, the AV5125 is quite light and small:The back of the unit shows the unusual BFA (British Federation of Audio) speaker connectors:I had to rebuild my test harness to test it which I was none too happy about it.  It basically a banana plug but hollow on the inside.The trick to light weight is a switching power supply and a set of fans to cool the heatsinks:A pair of integrated IC amps are used for each channel.  The heatsink is beefy despite its reduced height.  In use the fans never came on.  I am suspecting some kind of rail switching is used to keep power consumption low.Overall, it is a \"cute\" design if you have to ask me.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with a simple 1 kHz tone driving the amplifier to 5 watts with 4 ohm load:SINAD which is a combined metric of noise and distortion is above average of 90+ amplifiers tested in all forms:Crosstalk is not very good:Frequency response is also not flat which is surprising:Dynamic range though is very good especially near full power:As noted though, when I ran the full power test momentarily, it started to scream quite loud.  How loud you say?  Well, my wife who was downstairs, listening to her podcast using headphones heard it and asked, \"are you making that beeping sound?\"  So there, we also have wife stories in our tests!Power test produced an unusual curve:As you see in the two reference amplifier tests in dashed lines, usually the graph points down due to noise contributions lowering as power goes up.  Not here.  The curve is flat which indicates constant distortion.  That is not a bad thing per se as we see really good performance until we exceed 20 watts and then we get ordinary response.Same repeats with 8 ohm load:Here, at low power we have very clean output.Back to 4 ohm load, we can see how much more power we get if we relax distortion to 1% and also measuring momentary power:The news is not good as is typical in amplifiers with switching power supplies which run regulated.  For good or bad, you get maximum power they have in all conditions.  Typical class AB amplifier has unregulated power supply rails which due to a capacitor bank, can produce more power in short duration.ConclusionsThis is an unusual design from a high-end company which went after \"home theater\" market back in the day when they could (prior to HDMI video standard putting them all out of this business).  The guts is not high-end but seems custom and well thought out.  Performance is reasonable to good.  I tend to like the originality, small size, light weight and proper engineering from this Scottish company.If you can find one on the cheap (well under $1000), then it is worth looking at the Linn AV5125.  I am going to recommend it more from emotional point of view, than logic.  ',\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A200 stereo amplifier with USB DAC and Bluetooth. It was sent to me by the company and costs about US $160.The compact size should fit on desks well.  Controls are simplicity in themselves: push in the volume control to select input (RCA or Bluetooth/USB).  Rotate for volume.Nice to see built-in power supply unlike other AIYIMA offerings that required large external ones.  Design is based on TI TPA3255 IC.AIYIMA A200 MeasurementsLet's start with RCA input:SINAD which represents a measure of noise and distortion is above average:Unfortunately digital input degrades that some:So the rest of the tests are with RCA input.  SNR is good for class:As is distortion as represented by multitone:Frequency response is flat enough but is load (speaker) dependent:Crosstalk is good:Let's see how much clean power it can produce with 4 and 8 ohm loads:Allowing for 1% THD we don't get more power but burst delivery is higher:For a desktop amp, this is pretty good amount of juice.Sweeping at different frequencies shows very predictable response:Of note, power doesn't drop much at 20 Hz which is very good (and important).Finally the amp is good more or less when you power it up:ConclusionsAIYIMA once again shows that it has as solid hold in the mid-power amplifier market with above average performance at bargain prices. Integrated power supply solves one of the hassles of their separates and provides nice turnkey solution.  Interface and build is good for the class.  So really, if you want a competent amplifier with good power and little money, you have it.I am going to recommend the AIYIMA A200 amplifier.\",\n",
       " \" Hegel H95 integrated amplifier with DAC and streaming support. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $2000.The H95 looks pretty nice:I really like the large, high resolution and very responsive graphic display. What I don't like is the absence of power button on the front face.  After some research I found out it is on the bottom.  I realize without it there is symmetry but the one or two times that you play something super loud and want to rush to shut it off, you will hate the fact that it will take some effort to reach under to power it down.  Another thing I didn't like is lack of acceleration on volume control.  You have to crank and crank it to turn it all the way up and down.The back panel shows the extra connectively over a standard analog amplifier:Very nice to see built-in DAC and Ethernet streaming.  What is not is the maximum supported sample rate of 96 kHz over USB.  This tells me they are using ancient and obsolete USB interface.  They say they did this for ease of design and to save money to put toward making the DAC itself better.  We will see about that.A simple plastic remote control is provided which is very similar to what we see from Chinese desktop manufacturers.  I tend to like it but it is unusual for such an expensive product to come with this kind of remote.  Usually they include some heavy but harder to use remote.Hegel H95 DAC MeasurementsThis being an amplifier, I immediately jumped to measuring that part of it first.  But then I had to backtrack when I noticed digital input performance was worse than analog.  Given the line out, I decided to measure the DAC using coax input.  For some reason, like a Hegel DAC I tested in the past, my ASIO4ALL interface would not see the USB input so I decided to test with Coax.  Here is our dashboard with volume control adjusted to produce the nominal 2 volts:I don't need to tell you that this is stunning high level of distortion, landing the H95 seven from the bottom list of some 350 DACs tested:When sweeping IMD distortion level, we can see part of the problem:This is something we see in Audio/Video receivers where they set the optimal gain to drive their amplifiers and not the 2 volts we are looking for.  Even then performance is not good, barely showing less noise than a $9 phone dongle!  We can measure the noise itself:This is horrid performance in any modern DAC.Back to distortion, we see that again in multitone test:Jitter performance is lackluster and what I would expect to see from random ebay DAC:To finish our suffering, here is poor linearity measurement:I think they may have unseated Schiit with their multibit DACs and poor linearity!Really, really bad showing.Hegel H95 Amplifier MeasurementsI first started with line in and adjusted the volume to get the nominal gain of 29 dB we use in integrated amplifier tests:Noise and distortion is just above average:I expected a lot better as the company's claim to fame is a comparator which supposedly detects distortion and sends an inverted signal to the amp to correct.  We see plenty of amplifiers without such circuit performing far better as you can see in above graph.  And of course we have products that use true feed forward technology such as Benchmark AHB2 currently occupying #1 spot in above graph.What's more, there are stability issues with that circuit (my guess).  Check out the warm up performance of this amplifier:I have never seen anything like this.  Variations are quite large (as much as 3 dB) with two very large spikes.  It never stabilized even though I let it warm up far longer than other amps to tune of 17 minutes.  Best case performance was actually when the amplifier was just powered on at 80.5 dB SIAND but then finishing at 79.5.  Switching to DAC input which one would hope would eliminate source of external noise made things worse, not better in that regard:You are losing 9 dB in SINAD due to much higher noise floor.  Why or why?  Again, AV receivers do this but I don't think I have measured this kind of degradation before when using digital input.So from here on I focused on analog input.  Here is our dynamic range:I like to see 96 dB at 5 watts but 91 is fine.  The max power performance doesn't improve much because this is not a very powerful amplifier.Crosstalk is also good:Frequency response is flat in audible band:Power output is just 63 watts into 4 ohm at the knee of the distortion curve:Allowing for more distortion and busting sharply increased available power:Power into 8 ohm is very low for this expensive of an amplifier:Checking for frequency dependency we see something limiting power before the amplifier naturally doing so:Hegel H95 Headphone AmplifierI usually don't bother testing headphone output on this type of amplifier as it is usually an afterthought.  But company talks about improving its output and noise level relative to prior products so I decided to test it some.  Here is our power curve into 300 ohm:I like to see 100 milliwatts of power here and 80 is close enough.  Switching to low impedance, we should get a lot more power but we do not:The guarantee reason is high output impedance and that is precisely what we have:I am amazed that in this day and age companies like Hegel are not aware of the fact that high impedance is bad for many headphones (changes their tonality) and that even budget headphone amps have impedance below 1 ohm.  77 ohm is just out of the question.ConclusionsLet's quickly agree that both the DAC and headphone amplifiers are junk.  They are better off leaving both out.  You can do better with hundreds of products that cost the same as the shipping or tax of the H95.  I watched one video where the youtuber said he preferred the sound of Hegel DAC to his Chord Mojo in some ways.  Wonder what he thinks now.The amplifier in H95 is good as far as noise and distortion but nothing to write home about.  Continuous power is very low for an amplifier costing $2000 however.This is just a bad attempt all around.  I can't see any reason to recommend Hegel H95.  Company needs to go back to the drawing board and design performant DACs and headphone amplifiers as a minimum.  On amplification, they are being left behind by proper feedforward designs and excellent class D with tons of power. \",\n",
       " ' SMSL DA-6 stereo desktop class D amplifier. It was sent to me by Shenzhen Audio and costs US $99.Ah, what a pleasure it was to unpack the DA-6 and see this nice thin packaging!  That niceness extends to the back, fixing one of my main complaints with compact amplifiers:Instead of stacking the binding posts on top of each other and thereby making it very difficult to put large binding posts, they are lined up horizontally.  This allowed me to connect my locking banana plugs into them with relative ease. Of course we are saddled with large laptop power supply running at 24 volts at nearly 7 amps.A remote control is provided to navigate through the menus to change bass/treble settings, volume control, etc.  Same can be done with the front panel and rotary control.A new Infineon class D amplifier IC is used here (didn\\'t see the model number).SMSL DA-6 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual dashboard:Relative sum of noise+distortion as expressed in SINAD lands the unit above average of some 350 amplifiers tested:I am assuming volume is controlled digitally given the perfect channel balanced.  Noise performance by itself is good for the class:Frequency response in EQ bypass mode still has a bit of low frequency roll off:Type of speaker you drive with this little amp could benefit from being pushed to play those low frequencies.  I thought I could fix that by boosting the bass setting one notch.  That tool though brings a sledgehammer to a nail being put on the wall to hang a picture:Oh, I forgot to mention that there is no load dependency which is something we often can\\'t find even in expensive class D amplifiers.  Not only that, the response is quite extended, going beyond 100 kHz!  I guess this is what they mean by \"high-resolution.\"There is no warm up requirement as the unit is stable out of the box, running quite cool:Multitone performance is again good for the class:Output power is more modest than I wanted to see but I guess you can\\'t have miracles:The response though seems dependent on level and keeps changing at micro level.   We see the same when we sweep with different frequencies:There is no headroom as expected:ConclusionsSMSL nails the industrial design and usability of a super compact desktop amplifier offered in attractive aluminum case.  A clear white display shows the volume control and inclusion of remote control lets you place it out of the way and still change its volume.  I don\\'t usually take price into account but in this class I must.  For $99 this is a lot of performance and good lucks/design.I am happy to recommend SMSL DA-6.',\n",
       " ' B&K Components AV30.2 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The AV30.2 is discontinued but is available on the used market for low price I am told.  I found one listing with asking price of $175 but not others.  The good news is that it uses the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE class-D amplifier module so the review should be relevant to other amplifiers in the market now.The B&K amp is targeted the CI (custom integration) market meaning it is usually installed in home and businesses by a dealer/installer as part of a larger system.  This amp for example could be hidden behind a flat panel TV powering a couple of speakers.  For this reason, the form-factor and connectivity follows the requirements for this market.Here is the front panel:The \"business end\" is on the back:As you can tell, there is fair amount of connectivity for home automation.  I did not investigate them but I imagine you can power the unit on and off remotely to say, synchronise with the TV being turned on/off.I liked the level control for both channels.  It is buttery smooth, putting many other volume controls to shame.  Using that, I was able to get perfect match between the two channels -- something you can\\'t hardly do with any modern amplifier anymore.The speaker connections use phoenix connectors which while super common in CI industry, was not the greatest choice here.  It was very easy to have the outputs short out if you left any copper sticking out the screw terminal.  In use, the connector did not make tight enough connection causing the performance of one channel to vary as much as 20 dB.  It was tight by feel but noise level would go up and down if I wiggled it.  For intended application probably did not matter.  If you want to use it for hifi home application, you may want to hard wire them if you run into the same issue I did.In use, the unit barely got warm to touch.  There is plenty of ventilation on top and bottom which helps in this regard as does the high efficiency of its switchmode power supply and class-d amplification module.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard at 5 watt into 4 ohm:I adjusted the output gain to 29 dB which means the controls were near max.  Performance may vary some at lower gain values.  I used 29 dB since it is probably the most common/THX recommended gain level.THD+N was 0.008%.  The 50ASX2SE spec from what I recall is less than half at 0.003%.  The discrepancy may be due to gain stage, the connector and just variation in units.  Overall, it is in the ballpark of what they advertise.   This translates into a SINAD above mid-point of all the amplifiers we have tested:Signal to noise ratio is just good enough for 16-bit audio playback at 98 dB at full power:On right is the same measurement but relative to max of 5 watts.  SNR does not drop much which is very good.Frequency response was dead flat in audible band and quite well-behaved with output filtering:Wide-band FFT spectrum shows ugliness that we typically see in class-d amps (at 5 watt here) and this is probably a more uglier than the normal picture:More of a visual scare though than audio.Most important measurement for an amplifier is power versus distortion and noise.  Let\\'s start with the common load of 4 ohm:As you see, one channel started to deviate as I said in the introduction.  But still, both of them are smooth and well-behaved giving us a power rating of 42 watts before hard clipping sets in.At 8 ohm, power level drops a lot as you would expect:Funny there though in how much lower noise and distortion the AV30.2 has compared to the NAD T758 AV Receiver (in dashed blue).  Would be a good replacement for it had it had more power.  If the modules higher in range have same performance, they may be a good application to power home theaters.That said, these modules have almost no headroom as their peak power is almost the same as average:This is because unlike class AB amplifiers, the power supply in these class-D amps is regulated and so other than some storage in output caps, can\\'t provide more juice for short periods. Another sign of good design is how the performance of the amplifier varies with level and frequency:Each line pair of the same color (solid and dashed) is at a different frequency.  An ideal amplifier would not care about frequency so all the graphs would land on top of each other.  Here, they vary some but much less than some other amplifiers I have measured.ConclusionsThe B&K AV30.2 provides competent performance across suite of measurements.  It runs cool, is efficient and small.  It easily outperforms mass market AVRs for example.  Alas, there is not a lot of power here so other than desktop speaker application, I would seek out something more powerful.Overall, I am going to put the B&K AV30.2 and by implication, the ICEPOWER 50ASX2SE on my recommended list for mid-level performance amplification.',\n",
       " \" Niles SI-275 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The SI-275 is discontinued.  But since it is sold to the custom integration channel, they come up used and in working orders (companies pull out gear wholesale to redo homes).  I am told it can be picked up as low as US $100 to $150.  I see one on Amazon for US $230.  But there is a used one on ebay for $100.The look is fine:I like the tall feet on amplifiers to allow for more air flow.  A massive heatsink goes the full width of the unit with beefy transistors.  Love the fact that it has two trim resistors to balance the gain in both channels.  So annoying that these days balance controls are impossible to find yet amplifiers routinely have gain that is different in each channel (causing slightly shift in imaging).Back panel is simplicity in itself:In use, the SI-275 was solid as a rock.  Never shut down.  Never complained even when fully clipped.  The top of the unit barely got warm despite using traditional class AB amplification.  That large and heavy heatsink does a great job of spreading the heat load.  Nothing remotely like flimsy heatsinks in mass market stereo amplifiers or audio/video receivers.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsHere is our dashboard:Notice the perfectly matched channels.  SINAD is middling but is actually better because distortion is near -100 dB.  It is pulled down by power supply noise which due to being low frequency is not very audible.  Using what we have, performance is slightly above average:Noise performance follows the same standard:Frequency response is dead flat in audible band and extends way up:The wider the bandwidth, the more challenging the design (if not done well, the amp can oscillate).  Power into 4 ohm is healthy:Allowing for 1% THD+N, we get even more:8- Ohm power is:Response with bot loads is very controlled with no oddities.  Amplifier was stable as soon as powered on and performance did not change much after running for a few minutes (not shown).ConclusionsThe Niles SI-275 is made for abuses of custom integration channel which routinely stuffs amplifiers in places they don't belong (i.e. lack of circulation/cool air).  Its construction is well beyond today's mass market product.  Measured performance is just above average.  Combine these with prices as low as just $100 and you have a great deal.I am happy to recommend used Niles SI-275.  Bargain shoppers rejoice!  \",\n",
       " ' SMSL SA400 switching desktop power (speaker) amplifier.  It was sent to me by the company for testing and costs US $660.The SA400 is a powerful amplifier yet it comes in the same compact SMSL package and UI you would find in their desktop amp:Amplification is provided courtesy of ST Micro STa516BE.  The marketing material for SA400 shows a digital feedback but I don\\'t see that in the ST specs.  I am not clear if this is an addition by SMSL or it is part of ST amplifier chip that they don\\'t talk about.  Either way the input to the amplifier is digital so even though we have analog inputs, they need to be digitized to be used internally:A resonant LLC switching power supply provides the heft juice needed to drive this amplifier in a small package.  Bluetooth input is provided as well as a subwoofer output with low pass filter.  In addition, tone controls are included using a dedicated JRC chip.There is an informative temperature measurement you can turn on which I did as you see in the picture above.  With normal music listening (one channel) the unit stay pretty cool.  In testing however, the case got fairly warm and the display indicated 58 degrees C.  I suggest not stacking anything on top of SA400.One issue is a mechanical whine from an internal coil.  I can hear it even when nothing is playing from about 1 foot or so.  When testing at higher powers, this became much louder but when playing music, you won\\'t be able to hear it most likely.  SMSL SA400 MeasurementsThere are three gain settings but performance is very similar between them.  I adjusted high gain for 29 dB which is my standard (defaults to 30 dB):For the rest of my testing I used the adjusted high gain for better comparison to other integrated amps adjusted the same way.Distortion is around -90 dB but what pulls down SINAD is the rather high noise floor.  This causes the overall ranking to be just slightly above average:Indeed we can see the noise issue in our SNR measurements:State of the art amplifiers get 16 bits of dynamic range at 5 watts so we are two bits short here.  Even at full power you are adding noise to a 16 bit signal (you want your amp to be cleaner than the noise in the source).  This, and the fact that there is no bandwidth above 20 kHz nukes any idea of playing high-res content:Sure would have been nice to use an ADC that was running at 48 kHz, not 44 as it seems to be.  Use of the ADC is likely the reason the noise floor is higher than it would be otherwise.  We have seen this in AV receivers which likewise digitize their analog inputs (unless you put them in \"native\" mode).There is some very good news though. The feedback for the amplifier is taken post filtering which means it can compensate for the interaction between that filter and the load.  The above measurement shows actually two graphs: one at 8 ohm and the other, 4.  Both land on top of each other showing the amp doesn\\'t care which is great.  We only see this in the best class D amps like Hypex Ncore and Purifi.Crosstalk was very good but unpredictable:You can see the normal trend in the other two amps (dashed lines).Most important test for any amplifier is how much power we have and how much distortion and noise so let\\'s look at that at 4 ohms:This is a powerful little amp, producing nearly 500 watts of power especially if you allow some peaking:It complies with the spec which I think is 220 watts.  Power naturally drops at 8 ohm but still healthy:On our last test which is power versus distortion+noise at different frequencies.  The output was quite unique:I have not seen a power amplifier show this level of frequency independence.  Yes, having only 20 kHz bandwidth helps but still, even linear amplifiers don\\'t produce such dead straight and sameness the SA400 is producing.  This is quite excellent.Note that the the amp went into protection at both 20 kHz and 20 Hz in this sweep.  Alas there was no indication on the display. I had to power cycle the unit to get it to work again.SMSL SA400 Amplifier Listening TestsEven though I listen to every headphone amplifier, I only do so rarely for power amplifiers.  I decided to start doing listening tests with this amplifier which was a good thing.  I used an Infinity 253 speaker for my testing.  Despite driving only one channel, the SA400 drove the R253 with extreme authority and clarity.  Tons of detail and dynamics with little else to wish for.  Putting my ears next to the tweeter I could hear a slight hiss but a few inches away it would disappear.  The sound was so enjoyable I am still listening to it as I type this!ConclusionsSMSL brings us an interesting and unique power amplifier to us.  Love the load independence and small packaging plus tons of power.  Performance drops to average levels in some areas but nothing that appears to be faulty or poorly engineered.  I guess my one reservation is the cost.  I am not sure how much of this is temporary given the world order with component shortages, high shipping costs, etc. but to me, the better retail target would be $499.  The warranty is short at 1 year as well.  For DACs and such I am not worried about warranty much but for amps I do like to see longer warranty.Overall, I am going to put the SMSL SA400 on my recommended list.  It delivers tons of power with no weak points. ',\n",
       " \" Crown DCI 4 | 300N four channel DSP and networked professional amplifier. It was kindly purchased (used) and sent to me for testing and costs US $3,511.There is only a power on/off on the front. I wish there was a processing bypass as well. The full capability is visible on the back:I wouldn't be able to scratch the surfaces of all that this amplifier can do.  Suffice it to say you can do full processing (speaker and to some extent room EQ), environment/remote control, and transmission of digital audio over Ethernet type cabling.  Configuration is available using Audio Architect software.  Typical of these Pro applications, it takes a bit of effort to get used to its operation but after that, it seemed easy enough to use.A rather loud fan turns on during power on testing and then goes off.  Alas, during my testing it came back on.  Unless the amplifier is way away from your listening spot, better plan to put it in another room/dedicate closet.Connections are all through screw terminals. Not so bad for speakers but for balanced/unbalanced input, you are going to need to have bare wires (upper right phoenix terminals).  Not the end of the world but don't expect to buy and power on the same day if you don't have these bits.I was disappointed with the trim controls in the back.  They are very coarse and hard to adjust to an exact value.  And being on the rear makes it harder to manipulate.  For its intended application of professional installation is not a big deal but for one-off testing/use, is more work.I chose to test channels 3 & 4 as my standard setup is stereo.  During use, the amplifier case did not rise above ambient but again, the fan was running the whole time.Note: our company, Madrona Digital is a dealer for Harman and we move probably more Crown amplifier than any system integrated on the west coast.  So feel free to read bias into my subjective remarks.Crown 4|300N Amplifier MeasurementsUpon power on, output noise+distortion was quite stable which is nice:So on to our 1 kHz dashboard @ 5 watts into 4 ohm load:I must say, I expected much worse performance!  Distortion is below -100 dB and SINAD as a result, is dominated by noise.  As is, performance is a bit above average of many amplifiers tested to date:As noted, noise floor is somewhat high causing SNR at 5 watt to be below desirable level (90+ dB):Using default settings (which is how I conducted all of these tests), this is our frequency response:I was surprised to see the response not being flatter at 4 ohm.  Still, we are talking about less than 0.5 dB.  Importantly, there is slight change with load change to 8 ohm, indicating small amount of load dependency (which you could correct using DSP subsystem).Multitone yet again displays the low levels of distortion:Crosstalk is better than most amplifiers I measure:We have healthy amount of power into 4 ohm:And get even more when we allow 1% THD+N:Switching to 8 ohm load, we naturally get less but there is still good bit of power on tap:I was disappointed to see distortion rise though above 1 kHz as power increased:On the positive front, there is not much impact at 20 Hz so you can comfortably use the amp to power subs and such.Finally, turn on and off behavior is very good:Do notice the long time to turn on though (nearly 20 seconds).ConclusionsNice to see that as we go up in price performance of a pro amplifier improves as well.  No, it is not state of the art but this combination of four channels with sophisticated DSP and audio streaming is not easy to find in consumer domain.I am going to put Crown 4 | 300N amplifier on my recommended list.\",\n",
       " ' Behringer NX1000D power amplifier with DSP.  It is on kind loan from a member.  Can\\'t tell if it is discontinued or not but see it on sale at one place for $299.  Retail cost is $549.I am a fan of orange displays and NX1000D delivers on that (sorry my sample is not powered on):What I am not a fan of, pun intended, is the super loud fan that stays on all the time.  I walked away to go to the bathroom and was so surprised that I could hear it from very far distance in the house.  Unless you can put it in a sealed cabinet, I don\\'t see it being useful for hi-fi use.  Maybe you can modify it to quiet the fan or make it temperature sensitive. On the positive front, I really liked the look and feel of the control app that talks to it:The only thing I did not like about it is that it is not clear when some processing is on or off.  For example above, is the peak limiter on or off???The back panel shows SpeakOn connectors:And of course combo XLR/1/4 inch balanced inputs.  You can bridge the two channels although I did not test this configuration.  The \"1000\" designation is for total amount of power available.  As you will see, I was not able to come close to that in stereo use with 4 ohm load.Behringer NX1000D MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:This is average performance as amplifiers go:But it is good for pro amps.  SNR falls in the same category:Best in class amplifiers produce 96 dB at 5 watts and we are pretty shy of that.  So be mindful of background noise you may get out of your speakers if they are sensitive.Frequency response thankfully is load independent as the company advertises: Due to inclusion of DSP though, your bandwidth is severely cut to that of 44.1/48 kHz sampling.  So \"no high res sampling for you!\"Crosstalk was surprisingly good for the class:As I hinted, power delivery into 4 ohm is way under specifications:Even allowing for 1% THD and burst mode, we can\\'t get to the company spec:How did they get their 300 watt number?  Using car stereo \"standards?\"Power drops quite a bit into 8 ohm:Just 78 watts in a pro amplifier???  This is AVR class amount of power, not what you see in this class of product usually.Multi-tone test shows distortion increasing at both low and high-end of the spectrum:We see the same in our power testing versus frequency and distortion+noise:Notice how the 20 Hz distortion rises unusually what way.ConclusionsWe, the home users, look to pro products to get more wattage on the cheap.  Behringer unfortunately doesn\\'t give us that here.  Instead, it saddles the product with a loud, non-temperature sensitive fan which rules it out of many applications we may have for it.  So I don\\'t think it is a fit for what most of us want out of an amplifier even though there are some good qualities like load impedance independence, DSP, low cost, etc.As is, I can\\'t recommend the Behringer NX1000D.',\n",
       " ' five channel Classe Sigma AMP5.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and originally cost US $5,000.  I see one on ebay for $1,900 right now.This is one heavy amplifier for a class D architecture:At first I thought it had a linear power supply and its transformer was the reason behind the weight.  Alas, looking into other reviews and pictures inside, it uses a switching power supply.  So all the weight is from the enclosure and likely the very thick front plate.At first I was hoping that the glossy front where the logo is, is an LCD display with VU meters and such.  But there is not.  It is just for looks.  I must say as high-end products go, it is not that attractive to me relative to the high cost of the enclosure.  It has sharp corners which is not nice.The back shows quality selection of parts:I like the staggered speaker binding posts which makes it easier to plug things in.  XLR connections is what I like to see in an amp in this price range and we have them.  This amp was mated to their processor of the time which I suspect is discontinued longer than this amp.Amplifier MeasurementsI tested two channels (Ch1 and Ch2) using XLR input.  Here is our dashboard:Rather high second and third harmonics dominate causing the overall ranking to be middle of the road:Nice to see precise channel matching though.Frequency response showed unexpected results:Researching I found out there is an analog to digital converter which explains the sharp cut off.  I thought that meant DSP functions but there is none.  Instead, the digital signal is used as part of a protection circuit.  I can see that as a parallel path but not as the main path compromising the response this way.  This amp came out in 2015 so it is not like we didn\\'t have higher sample rates available then to at least go up to 48 kHz and get us flat audible response.Signal to noise ratio is middle of the road as well:Crosstalk is \"OK\" but should be better:Power vs distortion shows odd response at 4 ohm which gets worse at 8 ohm (see later):Very strange noise response at the start and the multiple sources of distortion take over, each causing their own non-linearities. On the positive front, we have healthy amount of power.  Not much more is available though in burst mode (typical of class D amps with their regulated power supplies):Here is power into 8 ohm:That step function is quite bizarre. Worst measurements came when bandwidth was increased to 45 kHz and frequency sweeps were used:No way this amplifier is so well behaved.  Instead I think there is high amplitude noise that is masking any distortion present (until clipping).  We can see that if we perform a wideband frequency analysis:We see sharp increase in noise right above audible band.  This is either caused by noise shaping in the ADC, the Amp or both and explains the previous graph.There is naturally switching spikes (near 400 kHz) but I am disappointed that its level is just 8 dB or so below our fundamental.  I like to see 20 dB or more attenuation. ConclusionsThis is a custom Class D design and switching power supply from Classe.  It clearly shows deficiencies of the design and creating a market for Hypex to come and show how class D is done.  Digitizing the input is not a good idea if there is no user benefit to it and there is none here.We could get depressed about the above or look at copious amount of power this amplifier produces while remaining cool (a bit above room temp in testing).  Since lack of power is the #1 reason amps sound bad, I am going to put enough emphasis on this as to not give it a failing grade.Overall, I am neutral on the Classe Amp5.  At current sale prices, you have about $400 per channel for 400+ watts of power.  It may be hard to match this with Hypex amp so you decide if it is worth it or not.',\n",
       " \" Schiit Vidar stereo amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Vidar costs US $699 and nicely comes with a five (5) year warranty.  With amplifiers being one of the most susceptible audio products to failure, long warranty is a real value.The Vidar sports the usual design style of Schiit which in this form factor is attractive:Despite its narrow width, the Vidar is quite heavy as it uses a linear power supply and class AB amplification topology.Back panel connectors are fine but I always miss balanced inputs in audio products:During power testing and such, the Vidar got fairly warm but not too hot and typical of the category.  It only shut down once when I ran a sweep causing it to clip at 20 kHz.I only tested the unit in stereo mode and not bridged.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz tone delivering 5 watts into 4 ohm load:We see the typical power supply noise spikes to the left and right of our tone.  SINAD (measure of noise and distortion) is dominated by second harmonic distortion though which rises to -80 dB or so in the worse channel.  As it is, performance is a few notches above average of some 85 amplifiers tested to date:Signal to noise ratio and crosstalk follow the same ranking:Frequency response is excellent though:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important aspect of an amplifier is amount of power it can deliver cleanly.  Let's start with 4 ohm load:We are getting 183 watts which is a bit shy of the 200 watt specification.  But that is at higher distortion.  If we allow that, we get there as well:Unlike class D amplifiers with regulated power supplies, class AB amps like Vidar have much higher peak performance for short duration as you see above right.Using 8 ohm load we actually beat the company spec:Finally, the difficult test of power versus distortion versus frequency:Nice to see these lines without any strange curves and overlap.  This indicates there are no hidden dragons in the design of Vidar, just a standard degradation with frequency.ConclusionsSeems that Schiit set up to design a straightforward Class AB amplifier with lots of powers and no design flaws.  In that regard, it succeeds.  You have an attractive amplifier with long warranty and lots of power into 4 ohm load.  At US $699, it is priced well.Overall, I am happy to recommend the Schiit Vidar.\",\n",
       " ' Parasound 2125 V.2 power amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $899.The 2125 has an understated look with just a few touches to keep it from looking boring. The only controls in front are for which set of speakers it drives.  There is more however in the back:For those of you wanting to use it with a sub, it has selectable high pass filter of 20 or 40 Hz.  Trigger is supported as well as bridging.Parasound 2125 V.2 MeasurementsI had a heck of a time getting stable ratings in the dashboard with channel 1 mostly going nuts on its own. I thought this was a grounding problem so tried many things.  There was hardly a difference.  It was not until the power measurements that I realized something is going on the amp in the 5 to 20 watt range.  Anyway, here is our dashboard when both channels were behaving:Measured noise+distortion lands the 2125 above average ranking:Noise performance is not great at 5 watts but naturally improves at full power:Multitone reflect the average distortion rating:Frequency response is very good:I was however surprised that gain dropped when I activated the high-pass filters.As noted, my first power sweep had instability in mid power.  I thought this was instrumentation error so I filtered the heck out of it and got these:On reflection though this was amplifier instability as we can see when I sweep the frequency:There is a frequency dependent hump in distortion which is very strange.  It is likely due to some kind of voltage rail switching.There is a lot of power available though in a cool running case:ConclusionsThis kind of performance would usually garner my recommendation for the 2125. On reflection though, I am worried about increased distortion in the \"sweet\" area of power band -- 5 to 20 watts.  Company needs to work on mitigating this issue.  So for now, I won\\'t be recommending the Parasound 2125 even though it checks many boxes from value to functionaltiy.',\n",
       " \" Class D Audio (the company) CDA-250C Power (speaker) Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The CDA-250C costs USD $495 from the company direct which barely sneaks it into affordable class.There is not a whole lot to look at on the face of the unit:As you see, the unit is made in USA.  I suspect the case is generic Chinese though given the DIY look and feel it has.The power button is oddly in the right side of the unit.The back panel sports very large speaker jacks which is nice:Unfortunately there are no balanced inputs even though the holes seem to be made for them.Another miss is lack of any safety or regulatory certification.In testing, the CDA-250C ran completely cool.  I could not feel slightest rise in temperature of the case whether I touched the top, left or right, which is really good.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard at 5 watts of output:I was pleased to see the unit working well enough to allow me to measure it down to DC and hence the DC offset.  Many recent switching amplifiers make my analyzer go crazy if I DC couple of it.SINAD (signal over distortion and noise) is rather low and seems to be driven by high noise floor than distortion products (which are below 100 dB).Signal to noise ratio is disappointing:We can't even clear the CD's 96 dB at either 5 watt.  We barely get there with 200 watts of output (which is already pretty distorted).The news gets pretty ugly when I measured THD+N versus frequency at six different power levels:We have multiple problems here.  At both low and high end of the frequency spectrum we have rising noise and or distortion.  The higher the power, the worse they get.At low power outputs (around 1 to 2 watts), low frequency noise seems to escalate which may be due to power supply noise.To top it all, two channel are wildly different than each other.  One seems to be a lot more susceptible to noise than the other.Let's look at the spectrum of 1 kHz tone with wide bandwidth and see if we can figure this out:I should have run this without my external filter but let's run with it anyway.  We see our usual spikes in hundreds of kilohertz due to switching frequencies.  But we also see a rise in noise around 50 kHz or so.  The previous test uses 90 kHz bandwidth so this peak will impact the measurements.  Note again the channel mismatch.Let's rerun the previous test, this time by limiting the bandwidth to 22.4 kHz.  Note that this means that we can't capture anything past second harmonic for the high frequencies (hence the reason the levels artificially drop there):The graph becomes somewhat cleaner especially at low output level (in red).  But otherwise, the signature issues with distortion/noise remain.Let's run our typical power versus distortion test.  Note that 1 kHz tone is used for this test so doesn't incorporate the issues we see above:We have good bit of power reaching 178 watts into 4 ohm before clipping sets in. FYI, I have refined this test to give us more resolution near max power so it is a bit unfair to previous products I tested.  Still, this is quite a bit more power than the two reference amps in the graph.When I get a chance later, I will test the output impedance versus frequency.  And a frequency response test which I just realized I forgot to run too.  ConclusionsGetting nearly 200 watts/channel into 4 ohm for a US made power amplifier for $500 is not bad.  Outside of that, you have to close your eyes to many flaws.  These noise and distortion issues way dwarf anything upstream.  As such, I don't see the Class D Audio CDA-250C in any kind of high fidelity system.  Our search will continue for something with Hypex NC400 performance but at half the price.Needless to say, I can't recommend the CDA-250C but you can judge it for yourself and your application based on above data and decide.\",\n",
       " ' 3e Audio SY-DAP2002 stereo desktop DSP amplifier with Bluetooth.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  I will also do a teardown and test with upgraded op-amps.  I went to look up the price just now and it says no longer available!  I think it was US 116.The enclosure is heftier than is typical for the class:A cute set of white LEDs rotate around the volume control when first turned on and then indicate volume level.   An unusual twist for this class of amplifier is inclusion of mains power supply:No figure-8 power cord was included however so I have to supply my own.  As you see, there is a little fan to help with cooling but it never came on during my testing.  I had the top open and touching the heatsinks showed that they were pretty cool which explains the fan staying off.Note that while there is a DSP subsystem, I did not test it.  It is based on \"Sigma\" ADAU1701 platform which I already reviewed. Amplification is provided using the ST Micro TPA3255 chip.SY-DAP2002 MeasurementsI started my testing using stock configuration:Distortion is quite low at -95 dB however SINAD is way worse at just 72 dB indicating noise as the limiting factor (SINAD is sum of noise+distortion relative to signal).  Don\\'t be confused by the -100 dB noise floor in FFT.  That is after some 35 dB of \"FFT gain.\"  The owner had warned me about the noise and indeed had gone ahead and purchased the recommended upgrade opamps, the LM 4562.  I took the top off and swapped both and performance indeed improved:Noise still dominates though so performance continues to be average:You can see the effect of noise in SNR tests:Here is the comparison of noise with no input signal with or without the op-amp upgrade:Frequency response is limited based on digitization and load dependency:Crosstalk was generally good but somewhat variable:Multitone test shows how low the distortion is, alas with high noise floor:Healthy amount of power is available before shut down:Because of aggressive protection circuit, I could not get to 1% THD to measure max or peak power.Good bit of power is available at 8 ohm indicating that the 4 ohm performance above is current limited:Transfer function is quite good for a switching amplifier:SY-DAP2002 TeardownOverall construction seems reasonably clean:Top row is the switching power supply which naturally has high-voltage rectified mains in it.  As such, I would have liked to see a routed slot in addition to existing isolation that exists on the PCB.  That would reduce the chances of arcing from high voltage side to the low voltage amplifier.Capacitors are lower grade as usual but at least all the ones I looked at are higher grade 105 degree C.  The heatsink is quite beefy for its size and seemed to do its job keeping the TPA3255 chip amp cool in my testing.  I am not sure the fan will do any good since it likely pushes air in but there are no vents to push air out.  High static pressure then reduces its effectiveness although likely it is better than nothing (if noise is not a problem).I did not like the Bluetooth antenna lead travelling from the front of the board to the mains side.  The noise from switching power supply may reduce Bluetooth range and at any rate, it is not a safe place for it should the lead come off and touch the high-voltage areas of the power supply.  The RCA cables could have been moved a bit up (in the picture) and made room available for that in the low voltage section.I see no regulatory and safety certifications which is not good in mains powered gear.Overall, this is not nearly as bad as it could be.  ConclusionsGetting a DSP platform and top-flight chip amp and power supply in a small box takes good bit of effort.  Overall, this is not a bad platform but compromises are there with performance dropping below what the chip amp can do.  Personally I use DSP upstream so have no use for it in the amp in this configuration so the performance hit (if due to that) is not good in my book.  But you can decide otherwise.I could have recommended the amp but seeing how I had to upgrade the op-amp to get good performance, I am going to pass.',\n",
       " \" Rotel RB-1070 stereo power amplifier. It was released in early 2000. Can't find the cost then but I see it used for around $400 to $500.I have always found Rotels to be most attractively designed power amplifiers.  One look at that front panel and you immediately think of muscle and beauty in design.  Alas, the extruded aluminum in front which gives it that look, is cosmetic.  There are two others internally which do the job of cooling this classic AB design.  In use the heastsinks got pretty warm to touch to give it some air to breath.Not much news in the back other than nice inclusion of trigger input/output:Rotel RB-1070 MeasurementsThe unit warmed up nicely without its performance changing much:So let's see what our dashboard of 1 kHz tone does into 4 ohm load:The amp is about 2 dB more sensitive than usual which likely accentuates the power supply noise a bit.  I was able to reduce 60 Hz hum in one channel but not simultaneously in the other.  That is exceeded however by the power supply noise at 120 Hz and multiples.  SINAD is likely dominated by distortion to the tune of -80 dB.  This lands the RB-1070 slightly above average of all amplifiers tested:Despite the power supply noise, dynamic range is very good:Frequency response is excellent and spec compliant:Crosstalk is good:Multitone shows no frequency dependence which is nice:There is ample power available into 4 ohm:The response is quite odd in that it doesn't slope down.  Don't know if that is intentional, accidental or due to power supply caps aging, letting in more ripple as power goes up.Regardless, lots of power is available:Company only specs the power into 8 ohm at 130 watts.  It certainly delivers that:Putting aside noise floor which is rather high, the units transfer function is one of the best I have ever seen:Sadly there is a significant power on pop:ConclusionsAs one of my favorite (looking) brands, I was very anxious to measure a Rotel amp, hoping it would not let me down.  Fortunately it did not.  No, the SINAD doesn't break new ground but the rest of the measurements are very good with plenty of power available.  It is a great choice for people wanting good amount of power in an attractive package with competent performance.I am going to recommend (used) Rotel RB-1070.\",\n",
       " \" Outlaw Model 5000 five channel home theater amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me.  Despite the number of channels and power of each, the Model 5000 costs only US $649 though shipping adds fair bit to it.The shipping is expensive because this is thing is super heavy.  It is at the limit of what I can reasonably carry upstairs to my lab (50 pounds):My back nearly got killed just rotating the darn thing in my photo booth:Sadly, as you see, there are no balanced XLR inputs.  You are given heavy binding posts though which is nice.Left and right channels are far apart which is the right away to do it as they, and the center channel get beat the most.  And is most logical layout in my book.In use the Model 5000 never complained, shut down or anything of the sort.  The heatsinks are below the top cover so you can't exactly feel their temps.  I would imagine it would shut down though if it got too hot.Not much else to talk about so let's get into the measurements.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Nice to see the gain at 29 dB which is the only recommended standard in the wild (from THX).There is fair amount of mains hum and power supply noise.  I improved them a bit with messing with grounding but this is the nature of the beast when a linear power supply is used.Distortion is dominated by second harmonic which combined with noise and hum gives us a middle or the road SINAD:Speaking of noise, there is our signal to noise ratio at 5 watts and near full power:I like to see 96 dB or better at 5 watts to clear the dynamic range of the CD but we don't get there.  At full power though, we meet that target and a bit more in the good channel.Frequency response is basically flat in the audible band:Testing with my simulated speaker model did not change the response hardly at all:Crosstalk was good as it should be in modular amplifiers like this with independent amps:Amplifier Power MeasurementsMost important deal with any amplifier is its power versus distortion and noise so let's start with 8 ohm load:Nice to see the Outlaw 5000 completely outclass our NAD AVR both in much lower noise, distortion and available power.  The picture is almost the same with 4 ohm load although distortion rises:These are two channel tests.  Adding two more 4 ohm loads power drops a bit naturally:That is over 800 watts delivered into the load which is great.Back to two channel power, here is what we get with short bust (simulating what you may get in music) and more steady state -- both at 1% THD+N:The toughest test I run is power versus frequency while trying to achieve 0.1% THD+N. The amp has to deliver its output while being stressed the entire 3 to 4 minutes the test runs.  Many AVRs quit.  Not so with Outlaw 5000:As you see, it not only passed the 2 channel test, but also 4 channel.  A quick statistical analysis of my high-res music library shows highest peaks at 40 Hz and that is where the cursor is.  We are getting 252 watts at that frequency with two channels and 207 watts with four channels.  Yes, it is lower than 1 kHz peak I use in other graphs but still a lot of power.ConclusionsDespite its bargain price, the Outlaw Model 5000 is solidly built and delivers tons of power without complaining.  It provides a clear setup over the built-in amplifiers in home theater AVRs.  No, it doesn't deliver state of the art distortion and noise.  For that, you will have to pay a lot more money.  For what it is, it is very good and I am happy to recommend the Outlaw Model 5000.\",\n",
       " ' Douk Audio H7 stereo class D desktop amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped to me by a member and costs US $144.Right away we see differentiation in the form of the nice looking VU meter.  Not only that there is a control to set it sensitivity which is a must in my view. The backlight is nice and bright and goes well with that yellow/orange ring.  The case is machined aluminum so feels nice and heavy for its size.  The switches and controls are surprisingly robust and impart a feeling of quality.  In other words, this is in entirely different class compared to typical budget desktop amplifiers.  Surprised continue to the back side:Yes, we have real, full size XLR inputs!  Of course there is also RCA input but they also added a set of RCA outs.  I am assuming that is to connect subs and out but there is no internal filtering.The heart of the unit is TI\\'s TPA3255 single chip stereo class D amplifier with very lofty specs:Wide input range is provided. Included power supply is manageable with 32 volts output with 5 amps of current.  If you are going to drive higher impedance speakers and you want to go louder, you may want to up that to 48 volts.One negative which actually follows some \"high-end\" gear is dual volume controls.  Yes, to increase or lower the volume, you have to crank both of them. I would have wanted to see a single volume control with a balance knob.  As is, you can set them once and use an upstream DAC with its volume control (and remote).  That is how I tested it by setting the gain to 29 dB and treating it as a power amplifier.  You can see the position of the volume controls in the picture for that gain setting.Douk Audio H7 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 1 kHz dashboard into 4 ohm load using XLR input:The SINAD of the good channel at 82 dB is above average for all amplifiers tested.  But for some reason the other channel (in blue) is distorting more which drags the average down some:Zooming in:Noise performance is quite good for class although short of the TI specs:As is typical of budget class D amplifiers, the frequency response varies with what load (speaker) you connect to it in treble region:This means you may hear brighter or softer sound depending on exact impedance of the speaker. Best to use EQ and tailor that to taste.Distortion is kept very low at 5 watts:The less good channel lost 1 bit here (not shown).  So still quite good and more than enough for the application.Crosstalk is very good for any amplifier let alone a budget one:Let\\'s see how it does in power department starting with 4 ohm load:This is good bit of power and only gets better if we allow 1% THD:I ran this three times as I could not believe it breaking into 3 digit department!  200 watts out of this little box?  Granted, the test is short term but still, that is quite healthy.Switching to 8 ohm we naturally get less power:Note that most speakers are around 4 ohm in bass frequencies where most of the volume is so don\\'t go optimizing for this unless you know you have an 8 ohm speaker in that region.EDIT: forgot originally to post the power vs frequency:There is only a dB or so impact due to warm up (one channel getting better and the other, worse) so I would just turn it on and use:Finally, there is likely to be some audible pop on both turn on and off:Kind of strange to see the blue channel die out that way.  This may have something to do with that channel also underperforming in the dashboard.I had no luck trying to test the H7 with my powercube reactive loadbox. It caused some kind of interference that would keep it from switching loads.  Will need to spend more time investigating what is going on.ConclusionsThe Douk H7 breaks new ground in multiple areas from nicely done VU meter, nice looking case, and very good measured performance.  The only issue is if you can live with dual volume controls.  I am happy to see such differentiation in this highly price sensitive and crowded market.I am going to recommend the Douk Audio H7 amplifier.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of a DIY combination of ICEpower 200AC and 200ASC in a Ghent audio case.  It was kindly supplied by a local member.  Total part cost is US $310.The case work is fine:I like the hefty power switch which also acts as protection circuit indicator.  Speaking of that, it is of nice variety that self-resets and doesn't require manual power cycling.The back panel sports far better connectors than you could get in any mass market amplifier:And of course balanced inputs.The internal amplification for one channel is provided by the ICEPower 200ASC which has an integrated switchmode power supply.  This in turn feeds power to the amplifier-only 200AC module.  Nice and clever!ICEpower 200AC MeasurementsLet's run our usual dashboard into 4 ohm:Having been spoiled by high performance class D amplifiers, this is somewhat of a letdown.  Distortion is dominated by third harmonic at around -78 dB which sets SINAD to the same rating.  Result is average performance among all amplifiers measured to date:Signal to noise ratio is good though:Frequency response is as well:Power into 4 ohm though show early rise of distortion:Disappointing to see performance be worse than some of the worst AVRs we have measured at the limit.  Same is true at 8 ohm:Even when we allow distortion to rise to 1%, we still don't get the rated 200 watt power:The power supply is the limiting factor likely.Sweeping the power range at different frequencies gives us very complex response:The lines going backward are caused by the amplifier going into temporary shutdown.  This is occurring at just 40 or so watts at 20 kHz!  Fortunately there is not much music power there but still, from engineering point of view, I like to see far cleaner and stable response.  In some cases SINAD is rising to below 50 dB at just 2 watts!ConclusionsAs usual, we have high efficiency and compact packaging of class D amplification here.  What we don't have is performance that matches or beats good class D amplifiers.  Of course the cost is much lower as well (compared to higher performance class D amps).  So you have a trade off to make.  I am too much of a perfectionist to want to recommend this unit but depending on what you are using it for, it may be fine.\",\n",
       " ' Emotiva BasX series A-500 five channel home theater amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The A-500 costs US $529 which seems reasonable given the functionality and ratings.I can\\'t say that I find the A-500 attractive but is not ugly either:Here is the connectivity which sadly does not include balanced XLR connections:This is a Class AB amplifier with a rather larger toroidal transformer.  It is not overly heavy though which my back appreciated.The heatsinks end well below the top of the case so it was hard to judge how warm it got by touching the case.  A quick test with IR temperature sensor showed the heatsinks running around 50 degrees C.In use the A-500 never complained, shut down or go into thermal protection.  This is nice benefit over the delicate amplifiers in AVRs which if you look at them wrong, they go into protection/shut down.  Clearly this is much more robust solution.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts output:I was surprised by two things: large channel disparity with respect to distortion (SINAD) and very high mains hum at 60 Hz.  No amount of playing with grounding fixed the latter which tells me the 60 Hz is probably induced from the transformer into the amplifier section.  The former, channel distortion parity varied with which channel you used.  Channels 1, 2 and 4 were very close and good.  Channels 3 and 5 lagged way behind.  The \"good channels\" had their SINAD actually dominated by that mains hum and power supply noise, not distortion (red channel).   The situation was reversed for the \"bad channels.\"Averaging all the channels we get a middle of the road score:Signal to noise ratio reflected the above issue with a-weighting resulting in substantial improvement of SNR:Our threshold of heaving in low frequencies is quite high so this is not as big of a problem audibly as it is in measurements.Frequency response was very good, almost ruler flat in audible band and going beyond 100 kHz at -3 dB:Crosstalk between channels 1 and 4 were rather disappointing:It is closer to a $29 amplifier than our state of the art Benchmark AHB2.The meat of the review is power measurements versus distortion.  So let\\'s get into that at 8 ohms:Nice to see the massive improvement relative to a higher end AVR (NAD T758) but as soon as distortion takes over, that advantage is sadly lost.  We do get a few more watts though than our AVR.Here is the same measurement with 4 ohm load:Let\\'s sweep from 20 kHz to 20 Hz and see how much power we get with THD+N set to 0.1% (barely or not audible distortion):We see a small drop in power at the extremes which is good.Some of you have been demanding that I work harder and measure performance with more than two channels.  So here you go:I could not get the amplifier to distort less than 0.1% with 4 channels regardless of output level. So I stepped that up to 0.2% to get the third graph.  I could have been watching a movie instead of running these extra tests so I hope you are happy!ConclusionsThe Emotiva BasX A-500 seems to be a decent shot at building a 5 channel amplifier for a very decent price.  Yes, it is a bit of a gamble how good each channel is, and how audible that mains hum can become.  Other than that, it is a definite step up very amplifiers in AVRs.Overall I can recommend the A-500 if you are on a budget and have a bad back stopping you from lifting something heavier.',\n",

It has been discontinued but back in 2010 (?) when it was announced it was US $4,200.  I see a recent ebay sale for a bit over $1,000.The Linn is an attractive unit:The interesting bits are in the back:You have full suite of analog and digital inputs although given the age, USB input is lacking.  Roon remote is built into the networking which is very nice for an older device.  And of course you have full amplification in there for a single box solution.Streamer DAC Stereo MeasurementsSince there is line out, let\\'s use the Toslink input into its DAC and measure what comes out before the power amplifier:By today\\'s standard, this is definitely subpar with sum of distortion and noise relative to signal not close enough to beat the CD format:I tested streaming with Roon player and performance was identical which is good.Amplifier Stereo MeasurementsI started testing the power amplifier by using the Toslink optical input first:We see sum total SINAD of 78 dB.  This obviously is NOT limited by the DAC as it produced 20 dB better performance.  Indeed switching to analog input we see that confirmed:As its, the DS-1 lies smack in the middle of rankings of all the amplifiers we have tested regardless of price (nearly 120):I quickly ran a frequency response test using analog input and was quite surprised that it was not flat:Thinking it may be digitized, I switched to digital input with both 44.1 kHz and 96 kHz sampling:We see the same curve.  So unless there is some kind of EQ I don\\'t know about, it is sad to see such roll off.Let\\'s measure power into 4 ohm:This is very little power for all but secondary use.  It naturally drops lower with 8 ohm load:And these are not \"good watts\" either given how early distortion takes over and flattens the curve and then swings up at clipping.ConclusionsIn 2010 this kind of functionality would have been advanced.  But today there are a range of streaming solutions with amps that retail in hundreds of dollars with much more power.  It is disappointing to see an engineering focused company like Linn target so low in power and noise and distortion.Anyway, even at $1000 I can\\'t recommend the Linn Majik DS-1.

The A800 costs US $299 including free shipping from multiple sites.The member who loaned it me has done a youtube video of it which you can see by clicking on this link.Behringer has been in this game for a long time and it shows from high level of optimization of weight, size and robustness of the A800:The unit is quite shallow relative to its width. Standard gain controls are provided which go up to 30 dB (for balanced input).  Nice set of LEDs show the output level including clipping indicators.  All amplifiers should come with such displays (with switch to turn them off).  I could do without the notches in the volume control though as they are fake (they are fully analog) and made exact setting harder (it would creep into the notch).  Not a big deal though.Back panel shows nice set of connectivity:For my testing I focused on XLR input only and standard speaker banana connectors.The amp hardly radiates any heat and has no fan.  Given the pro application of these amps, I expect them to be robust and reliable.During measurements, the A800 provides high level of predictability and assuredness that I sometimes miss when testing switching amplifiers.  It only shut down once after fair bit of experimentation at full power.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a gain of 29 dB to deliver 5 watts into 4 ohm load:This performance is very close to the Behringer A500 which I reviewed before.   That amp though, generated much worse SINAD because of its non-switching power supply:Its distortion products are capped to -80 dB which is what we see in A800.   Eliminating those power supply components sharply improves SINAD which is relative to sum of noise and distortion:Signal to noise ratio is \"OK:\"Don\\'t use it on sensitive speakers you may hear some hiss (although turning down the gain may help some).32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows early rise in distortion with frequency:Crosstalk is reasonable:Dual, 19+20 kHz tone shows very high level of intermodulation distortion as we saw in multitone test:Fortunately your music doesn\\'t have such high amplitude tones and threshold of hearing is high that I don\\'t think this is nearly as much of a problem for the ear as it is for the eye.Frequency Response MeasurementsThe necessary low pass filter is causing some peaking at 20 kHz to the tune of 0.5 dB:The above is with a resistive load.  I have been asked frequently how the amp performs with a real speaker.  Stereophile uses a simulated load of a 2-way speaker that was given to them by NHT.  I built a similar load based on schematic from Doug Self:Here is the impedance of my load versus frequency:My response is more damped in low frequency than what Doug Self and Stereophile show.  I will investigate this further but for now, it is close enough.  Here is the phase response:And Stereophile graph of the two:Using my simulated load this is what I get with A800 amplifier:As you see, there is hardly any difference.  Looking at stereophile graphs, they use highly zoomed version to show differences.  This is what happens when I do the same:So a bit of ringing becomes apparent but it is so small as to not be of any consequence.  Heaven knows your speakers are not anywhere close to this level of variation.I will test some of the other amplifiers I have with this load and see if it causes more variation.  As it is, resistive load is the same as complex one.Note that neither my load, nor stereophile\\'s are high power ones.  So I cannot plot full power graphs and such.  Above measurements were at 5 watts.Amplifier Power MeasurementsGoing back to our resistive load, we get this output with 4 ohms:The show starts well with A800 being much quieter than our premium brand NAD AVR.  But then distortion kicks in and we don\\'t do as well.  We get however tons of power nearly a quarter of a kilowatt.  Similar story holds for 8 ohm load:Still, that is a lot of power at 8 ohm leaving our AVR way back in the dust.Using 1% threshold for THD+N, we get more power naturally than my graphs above indicate:Left hand is short-term burst power, right side is long term.Thermal StabilityPerformance improved just a bit after 10 minutes of warm up at 5 watts:So you don\\'t have to leave it on for good performance.ConclusionsThe Behringer A800 does what pro amps try to do: provide solid, middle-of-the-road distortion and noise with tons of power in quiet and light package for little money.  The design is stable and better than the A500.  As such, I can recommend the A800 as an everyday amplifier.',\n",
       " \" Wyred4Sound mINT integrated stereo amplifier and DAC.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,499 from the company.  I see reviews dating back to 2013 so the box has been around for a while.The design goes with the rest of Wyred4Sound gear although in person looks less refined than I expect in this price range:The back panel shows some very good functionality such as triggers and home theater pass through:The overall package is small and convenient from that point of view.  It ran reasonably cool which was also nice.As I took this picture, I realized USB only goes up to 96 kHz which is the old school USB interfaces of the time.  Fortunately it is asynchronous which was novel at the time and could have been worse in the form of synchronous USB.Wyred4Sound mINT MeasurementsWhen I first powered on the unit, the measurements were low so to make sure it was not my setup, I took the time to route all cables separately tightened all the connections and performance seemingly improved.  But this morning I got up and thought maybe the box was warming up and changes had nothing to do with the wires so ran my standard warm-up test:Looks like my guess was correct.  The amp did not stabilize even after 7 minutes of running with load on.  I waited at least that long before I took the measurements you see below so represents the warmer side of things.  With amplifiers with both digital and analog inputs, I always have to determine which input is best which depends on topology of the amp.  So let's do that here, first using Aux In analog input:I tried hard to suppress that mains noise at 60 Hz but every change made it worse.  I then switched to USB input:Man, this is bad.  It should be a walk in the park to have  DAC that keeps up with an amp that has a SINAD of 77 dB but here we are, with one of the worst performances I have seen with digital input.  So let's continue with analog input for the rest of the tests starting with our SINAD rating:So below average and disappointing.  Even more disappointing is the high noise floor:Crosstalk is fine:Frequency response unfortunately shows variability which means the class D amp used doesn't use a feedback loop outside of its filter to remove that dependency:Assuming you have good high frequency sensitivity, this amplifier will sound different with different speakers.We see that distortion sets in early and rises a lot:Here is our peak and max power at 1% THD:Sweeping different frequencies shows reasonable response for a class D but not in general:ConclusionsI very much like the functionality of the mINT with cute small size.  Performance though is subpart and much better can be done than what we have here with discrete parts which may cost even less than this combo.So I can't recommend the Wyred4Sound mINT.  But if you are fond of the functionality, I am not going to chase you out of the room .\",\n",
       " \" Jeff Rowland 535 stereo (bridgeable) amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  I believe it costs US $5,900.If you are not familiar with Jeff Rowland, it is a high-end audio company, known for their gorgeous machining of their cases that imparts a 3-D look.  You can see that coming through the protective film which I chose to leave on:The unit is incredibly heavy for its small size.  The back panel shows the most unusual binding posts I have seen:Those big knobs rotate to tighten bar on two spade terminals.  The feel incredibly nice.  Alas, they don't mate with banana leads and I had to screw around to connect mine.The amplifier is said to be balanced throughout including input transformer which is made with wire from Cardas (!).  Company only states that a switching power supply is used but says nothing about the rest of the functionality.  From my testing, it seems to be class D which would explain why the amp stayed completely cool to touch under testing as if it was never on!  The massive chunk of chassis aluminum is likely responsible for great thermal performance.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 1 kHz dashboard at 5 watts into 4 ohm:Ah, this is disappointing.  Distortion peaks to -80 dB which sets SINAD at an average number of 77:This is way below stated of the art in switching amplifier design.  Company specs are similar by the way so this is representative performance as designed.Where specs don't match is in signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk curve usually gets worse with frequency (due to increased effect of stray capacitance) but here it is rather flat:Frequency response is very good with no indication of interaction with the load:Another shortfall from the spec is in power department:Letting distortion peak up to 1% still doesn't give us what the spec says:I don't know how they get to 500 watts unless it is at even higher distortion levels.As a way of comparison, let's see how the power curve looks like relative to noise and distortion of Hypex based NC400:We have slightly more power although the NC400 I tested had a shared power supply.  That aside, there is no comparison in noise and distortion department.  The 535 way underperforms the Hypex.Finally, here is an unfiltered output of the amplifier at 5 watts:We clearly see the switching waveform.  Attenuation is better than 30 dB which is more than a number of other amps I have tested so that is good.ConclusionsThe Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier has beautiful fit and finish.  And is solidly engineered to run cool and I am sure reliable as a result.  It produces good bit of power which should be able to drive many speakers to desired loudness.  Alas, it reinvents the wheel and makes it less round.  Any amplifier based on Hypex modules will have as much or more power with far less noise and distortion and lower cost.Bottom line, I can't recommend the Jeff Rowland 535 due to its high cost and average noise and distortion.\",\n",
       " ' Fosi Audio TB10D stereo amplifier. It was sent to me by the company and is only sale for US $70 on Amazon including shipping.We have the typical compact desktop aluminum case. Controls feel nice for the class.  Tone controls are not centered however for flat response (you can see in the picture what I set them to). Typical of these budget amplifiers, power is provided externally through a switching supply:Binding posts are spaced out a bit more which made it easier for me to plug in my large cables.This is a class D amplifier based on TI TPA3255 single chip amplifier.Fosi Audio TB10D MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watts measurement of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load:Dominant distortion is third harmonic which essentially sets SINAD to same level. This is slightly below average but considering the price of this amp, it is reasonable:Kind of interesting that the $5,900 Jeff Rowland 535 amplifier lands almost next to it!Signal to noise ratio is modest but again, good for the class:Crosstalk holds its own against much more expensive amplifiers:Frequency response is variable due to bass and treble control and load dependency:The load dependency is the norm in this class.  Hopefully some amp comes along and with no cost penalty takes care of that (by incorporating the output filter into the feedback loop).Distortion rises with frequency which we can see in multitone test:Power is everything in amplifiers so let\\'s see how much we have:This is quite healthy for such a small and low cost amplifier!  It gets even better if we allow 1% distortion:We are talking essentially 200 watts coming out of this little box!  Cost per watt is just 35 cents.  Amazing.Even with 8 ohm load we get good amount of juice:Amplifier \"transfer function\" (output vs input) is very good for class D although it does show rise in distortion as noted earlier:Of note, you still have 66 watts of power at 20 Hz.  Many budget amps drop to 20 or so watts which can be problem as bass is what requires power.ConclusionsMaybe one day this will change for for now, in under $100 range you can\\'t expect perfection in performance of a stereo amplifier.  What you do want to see is delivering healthy amount of power with close to our average of all of our amplifiers tested to date.  On that front, the Fosi Audio TB10D delivers. If you need an amplifier for secondary use (bedroom, workshop, etc.), the TB10D is a very good candidate for no more money than one or two dinners!I am going to recommend the Fosi Audio TB10D amplifier.',\n",
       " ' SMSL A100 A100 stereo amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member. I can\\'t find it on sale anywhere but seems to have cost US 100.I like the simply but rather elegant/symmetrical design.  Same for thoughtful rear connections:Almost every manufacturer puts both speaker outputs together making it so hard to plug in the banana plugs. Here they are spaced apart which essentially solved that problem. Inclusion of an AC power supply is unheard of in this price class and nicely declutters your desk.Oddly the USB input is type A.  At first I thought this was for external storage but manual talks about using this with a computer.  I didn\\'t have a type A to type A cable so didn\\'t test this and stuck with Aux analog input.The heart of the unit is Infineon MA12070 class D amplifier.SMSL A100 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard:Distortion is actually better than 90 dB but there is rising level of noise and high order spikes which drag it down to 76 dB.  This puts is slightly below average:Edit:Request was made to measure using USB input.  I had to use a special breakout box to interface to the unit given its type A connector.  Here is the dashboard:As you see, performance is degrade fair bit.  My breakout may be causing some clock jitter but then again, if async USB is implemented, this should not be the case.Noise performance is \"OK:\"Multitone shows the same problem at high frequencies:I expected frequency response to have load dependency but thankfully, it did not:What ringing it has is above audible band which is good.Crosstalk is very good, beating some home amplifiers:Power output is naturally modest:Sensitivity to high frequency input becomes very clear as we do power sweeps:Unit didn\\'t need any warm up.ConclusionsThe message here is a sum of good and not so good.  I really like the frequency response for a class D amplifier and inclusion of AC power supply.  Distortion on the other hand rises with frequency.  I like to see perfection but we don\\'t have such an example below $350 currently.  Overall I would say not a bad attempt.  Strange that despite having become available late last year, it is discontinued already.  Maybe there are part shortages.I am going to recommend the SMSL A100 as a budget amplifier.',\n",
       " \"This is a review and detailed measurements of BasX A-100 Class AB amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member and drop shipped to me for testing.  The A-100 costs US $229 from the company direct.I must stay, this is one gorgeous looking and nicely feeling amplifier:This is a deep cabinet ending in the terminals in the back:As you see it has trigger capability.  Not a fan of the figure 8 AC mains cable as I have very few of them.  Best to not lose it.There is a fan on top but I did not hear it come on.  The unit does get quite warm though so allow ample cooling/space above it.Emotiva BasX A-100 MeasurementsAnother member had contacted me asking me if I could test if the unit was distorted while cold.  I had stopped testing for this since the warm up effect has been so minimal.  Not so here:You see what I am seeing?  12 dB improvement in distortion after 5 minutes???  I am assuming bias is not optimal while cold but why? Temperature compensation is quite cheap and has been part of design of amplifiers forever.Anyway, here is our usual dashboard:Not happy about the channel gain difference.  As it is, performance is a bit below average:I like to see a dynamic range at 5 watt approaching 96 dB and we are fair bit short of that:Frequency response is flat enough:Crosstalk is pretty good for a budget amp:Here is the multitone:Power versus distortion+noise is good:If we allow 1% THD, we get the power spec from the company:Distortion characteristic has a simple relationship with frequency and that is it:ConclusionI really like the packaging and price of this amplifier.  While overall performance is good, having to wait 6 minutes before it stabilizes is just not acceptable.  I would be tempted to buy this and mod it to make it temperature stable.As is, I can't recommend the Emotiva BasX A-100 amplifier.\",\n",
       " ' Argon SA1 integrated amplifier with phono input and Bluetooth. It is on kind from a European member and costs €369.I have a soft spot for white audio electronics and the SA1 goes right after that!  Quite elegant. What I didn\\'t like is the lack of indication on the file LEDs which indicate inputs. The volume control is digital (also controlled via an included remote). Pushing it selects the input.  The LEDs also blink for other reasons I did not try to figure out. Here is the  back panel:It was odd to see just a type A USB that is indicated as USB power.  There should be proper USB input in this day and age. There is pre-out but in my testing, I found that the volume control did not adjust it when using digital input but did with phono. Maybe this was operator error, I don\\'t know as only a single half-sheet of instructions is provided with the unit.The unit as shipped is for 50 Hz/250 volt so I used my lab AC generator to power it.  Specifications say \"40 watts\" of power so thought my 300 VA lab supply is enough.  As it turns out, it was not.  See the measurement section.FYI, there is a very clos cousin of this unit from NAD in the form of AMP1. I could not find either for sale in US.  The AMP1 lacks Bluetooth I believe but has Chromecast built in (?).  It is not clear who built this unit.  Likely it is an OEM for both.Argon SA1 DAC MeasurementsI fed the unit Toslink and measured from the pre-out.  The output was severely clipped.  So I brought the input level down -12 dB to our nominal 2 volts and no clipping:This lands the unit in the middle of our \"fair\" category:I like to see a SINAD of over 100 dB for this class product and we are good few dBs short here. Here is the response sweep of digital input levels:Our dynamic range is just \"OK:\"At this point, the picture of the DAC performance is clear so I thought I cut to the chase and measure the amplifier.Argon SA1 Amplifier MeasurementsWith amplifiers that have both analog input and digital, I start by testing both to see which is more transparent and run with that.  Here is analog input:This is not a happy picture with rising low frequency noise and distortion that is just below -80 dB.  Let\\'s try Toslink input:Ah, that is much better.  The combination of noise and distortion is well above average now:So let\\'s continue with Toslink input starting with our SNR:We are a few dBs short of my 96 dB requirement for 5 watts but 88 dB is not so bad. I expected crosstalk to be better given the digital input:Frequency response shows some load dependency in this Class D amplifier but better than many with this problem:Let\\'s see how much power we have starting with 4 ohm load:Multitone performance is good:I could not get to clipping range as my AC lab supply would shut down.  So likely there is more power to be had as you can see in this dynamic test:I did have enough juice to run the 8 ohm test:In both cases the SA1 beats the ARCAM AVR10 in noise which is good.Argon SA1 Phono MeasurementsThere was tremendous amount of mains interference in the phono stage dashboard.  I am not going to show that as it may be due to use of my lab supply.  But here is the all important RIAA equalization:It seems to be a little heavy handed in upper bass with a rumble filter built-in.  Not bad but not perfect either.ConclusionsI really like the way the SA1 looks.  But looks can\\'t get me over \"checklist\" DAC performance of around 16 bits.  The analog input on the amp doesn\\'t perform well but digital does.  Overall I have mixed feelings on the unit so not going to pass judgement one way or the other.

       " ' Crown XLS 1502 \"PA\" Power Amplifier.  It is on a kind loan from a member who bought it new and drop shipped it to me.  It retails for USD $349 including free Prime shipping from Amazon.  At that price, it seems like an incredible value.I have to say, while the unit looks industrial/military, it does not at all feel cheap.  As expected it comes in 19 inch rack mount configuration but very shallow:Not only do you get a high power amplifier with front graphical display and such, but also a built-in DSP.  It is not a fancy subsystem but allows you to dial in crossovers and such which is very handy in live sound.   At may company (Madrona Digital) we use a ton of Crown amps not for hifi applications but for music distribution in the home.  The built-in DSPs come in handy for limiting the frequency range, max output, etc..Unlike home units, the XLS 1502 has a built-in fan with tons of holes for ventilation as you see.  Fortunately it is temperature controlled and barely came on during my nearly 50 watt soak time.  And when it came on, it was very quiet.Here are the guts of the unit (click on the image for larger size):Man, is this clean!  Look at the beefy mains chokes to keep noise at bay.  The power supply is integrated on the same board as the power amplifier so you can\\'t swap one to fix the unit although at these prices, getting a new unit is more economical anyway.  The fan is placed not only in front of the heatsinks for the power transistors but also the output filter inductors which is nice as far as keeping them cool too.I noticed that the output stage is depopulated.  Seems then that the step up model just has a few more parts in it and that is that:There are tons of connectors in the back which I let you read about elsewhere.  Overall, this is jaw droppingly nice unit and unbelievable at the price that is being charged.I did a lot of searching and was surprised that there were no measurements of these units.  A lot of empty reviews, yes.  But no measurements.  So you get to have an exclusive set of data in this review!    So let\\'s get into that.MeasurementsI started by cooking the unit for a while at 48 watts with kind permission from its owner:Unlike some other amps, bringing the unit up to temp ever so slightly worsens performance.  There are also some interesting thermal effects from time to time represented by the spikes.  Anyone who thinks they can predict what thousands of components do as they warm up should get into predicting the weather on tuesday next week, 10 years from now!  Anyway, let\\'s look at our dashboard at 5 watts of output:Sorry I did not set the reference in the FFT.  But the news is there in the SINAD (signal over distortion and noise) of just 75 dB.  We have seen worse but also much, much better.  Gain is about 30 dB by the way.Signal to noise ratio is decent but again, nothing high-end about it:Let\\'s look at power versus distortion+noise:So we see that the Crown XLS 1502 easily outperforms the no-name Chinese class D amp we recently tested (IRAUD350).  It has a well behaved response with sloping down curve and then onset of clipping.  Power was around 336 watts @ 0.008% distortion.  I say \"around\" as there are not enough points in these measurements to find the exact onset of clipping.  The number is therefore a bit understated.  Crown specs the unit at 525 watts though at 4 ohm and we are not going to get there without a lot of distortion.The hypex Hyped DIY Nc400 amplifier far outperforms the XLS 1502.  It has far lower noise and distortion although not as much power before clipping.  It costs nearly four times as much though.I thought I do a comparison against the Behringer A500.  The A500 feels a lot more cheaply made but is also priced at $199:We see that the Crown XLS 1502 is better in every regard with lower noise and much more usable power before clipping.I thought the continuous power would be a walk in the part for the XLS 1502 but did present a surprise:The red \"thermal\" light came on the front panel but instead of shutting down, the power was reduced a bit.  \"The show must go on\" seems to be the rule here and nice to see instead of full shutdown we saw with Hypex Nc400.   As you see, I let the unit keep going and it went to 8+ minute maintaining that status.Frequency response was surprising but easily explainable:We have a \"brickwall\" style filter which indicates our analog input is digitized first through an ADC running at 48 kHz sampling, processed through DSP (or not), and then converted back to analog before amplification. Both the ADC and DAC therefore sharply limit the bandwidth to 48 kHz.  I was surprised to see some roll off at 20 Hz too.Wideband FFT (without AES filter) as usual shows a lot of activity in higher frequencies:The first peak is very nicely truncated at a little less than 100 kHz to pass emissions standards (by 60 dB).  Crown class I devices interleave the output stages which would explain the energy spread over four quadrants at multiples of that ~100 kHz pulses.  Since the XLS 1502 has passed emissions standards I would not worry too much about them.ConclusionsIt is hard to fathom that a properly engineered and produced mainstream brand amplifier with so much power can be sold for so little money.  This is a robust but bargain amplifier designed for heavy punishment in live sound.  Can it be used for hi-fi use?  Sure but it will severely limit both the resolution and potentially bandwidth of upstream sources.  Its best use would be as a subwoofer amplifier.  If you need an all in one unit, Hypex NC400/NC500 designs are so far my choice among amplifiers tested.',\n",
       " ' Outlaw Model 7140, seven (7) channel home theater power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 7140 seems to have come out a few years ago and is shown as discontinued.  At the time it was out, the cost was a reasonable US $1,100.  The new replacement series, 7000X looks just like this so not sure what they have changed.The 7140 is a beast of an amplifier, nearly breaking my back carrying it up to my lab:The design is highly modular with a massive toroidal transformer powering 7 independent amplifiers, each with their own power supply on board.  The heatsinks are rather beefy with plenty of distance between them and top of the unit.  The feet are also quite tall allowing better ventilation from bottom to top.The back panel shows the inclusion of XLR inputs which I appreciate:The inclusion of a grounding terminal was interesting.   It did no good in my testing with XLR inputs as it should not.During use, the 7140 was quite stable, never complaining, shutting down or anything as Audio/Video Receivers (AVRs) tend to do.  Clearly then this is a more robust solution than internal amps in those units.Power Amplifier MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard view of 5 watts into 4 ohm load using a 1 kHz tone:I was surprised to see such high mains hum at 60 Hz.  A prior review of another unit with just RCAs complained about the same thing and recommended a ground terminal on the unit which they have added.  But as I mentioned, it made no difference.  I have to think this is magnetically coupled into the amplifiers.Fortunately or unfortunately the distortion spike from 2nd harmonic is bit higher still so didn\\'t impact measured SINAD (combination of noise and distortion relative to our main tone).  As it is, the 7140 lands below the average for all the amplifiers we have reviewed so far:Frequency response is flat enough:32-tone signal to resemble \"music\" shows the typical rise of distortion with frequency:And rather high noise floor which could be caused by that power supply hum.Here are the noise figures for 5 watt and full power:We are not clearly more than 14 bits or so at 5 watts so not very quiet.Here is our power versus distortion and noise at 8 ohm:We see the elevated noise and distortion relative to our reference amplifier.  Power produced is right on the money at 146 watts.Here is the same at 4 ohm:The above tests are at 1 kHz.  Here is what happens when we sweep the frequencies, aiming to measure power at 1% THD+NQuite a drop in power with both loads when we get down to 20 Hz.  The power supply capacitors are likely too small to keep up with the slow rate of change at low frequencies.We see a similar view when we look at sweeps at different frequencies:Finally, some people like to see intermodulation distortion of 19 + 20 kHz tones so here it is at max power:ConclusionsThe Outlaw Model 7140 has a very sturdy build.  It produces good power per specifications provided from manufacturer (at least in two channels).  The down side is too much ground/mains leakage and distortion+noise that is slightly below average.  Paying more (a lot more actually) will get you sharp reduction of such problems.For typical home theater duty, the 7140 should do the job fine.  It just isn\\'t something to get excited about from pure performance point of view.',\n",
       " \" Sound Town ST-UPDM4C four (4) channel professional amplifier. It was purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me. It costs US $540.As you see, there is a bit of style to this amp with the front panel.  This is a straight amplifier with no DSP:The fans came on immediately and made moderate amount of noise (much quieter/lower pitched than many small fans like this).  As you see, input is XLR and output is speakon connectors.I was very pleased to see Audio Precision analyzer graphs in the manual.  They were quite tiny and hard to read but made me hope that the design was verified through such.Sound Town ST-UPDM4C MeasurementsThe tests you see are all performed using Channels 1 & 2 on one side.  Let's start with our dashboard:SINAD is below average of all amplifiers tested by 4 dB but for a Pro amplifier, it is not bad:But there is more going on here.  There is broad set of noise between 2 and 4 kHz.  I shut off the signal feed to it and was very surprised to find this noise component:Seems like some square wave with harmonics buzzing around internally that is bleeding into the amplifier.  Not good.That noise limited the signal to noise ratio:It also showed up in multitone test:Notice how the ends of the spectrum has reduced levels which indicates non-flat frequency response:Not only do we have (speaker) load impedance dependency but we are missing the lows as well below 40 Hz or so.  As such, you can't use this amplifier for subwoofer duty.Amplifier is rated at huge wattage so I was shocked to see so little output with 4 ohm load:I am used to seeing power exaggeration in pro amplifier specs but this is in entirely different class.Strangely, I got identical amount of power into 8 ohm load:Is there some kind of limiter in the unit?  There must be.  See what happens when I change frequencies:See how the curve goes up but then starts to go backward below 1 kHz?  That is electronic limiter in action.  Finally crosstalk was very poor:ConclusionI have hardly seen any audio device show issues in every test I run but here we are.  I don't understand what is going on here.  How can they have analyzed the performance using AP yet have so many issues left on the table?  Did they design change post those measurements?  This is the frequency response from the manual:It shows flat response to 20 Hz.  Notice the date is 2003.  Is it really that old of a design?Anyway, I can't recommend the Sound Town ST-UPDM4C. \",\n",
       " ' PS Audio Sprout100 integrated DAC, headphone and power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The Sprout100 is an upgrade over the original Sprout and costs USD $599.I remember the first time I saw the Sprout at an audio show.  I thought it was utterly cute!  It is small and handsome little package with a ton of functionality:As you see, in addition to functions I mentioned, it even has Bluetooth included.  And moving magnet turntable input.  It is a dream product for a frustrated marketing guy in a high-end audio company like PS Audio, wanting mass market product that appeals to the \"younger audience.\" The volume control is a rotary encoder with a built-in switch that powers the unit on and off.  If you hold the button down, the LED color changes from purple to white, indicating bass boost is on.  The rotary encoder is poorly programmed to have linear and slow response, making it very, very slow to change volume.  To go from low to high volume you may have to turn it seven or eight times!  We live in a digital age with music that is fast to access and comes at all levels.  Having the ability to quickly change volume is important.Input selection is old school mechanical selector.  I like the clear labels.The backside shows how much is crammed in there:I did not test sub out but it has sensor that automatically activates that output (and rolls off the mains?).In addition to USB input, we also have toslink optical which is nice in case of ground loops.The nicest bit is included power supply in such a small package.  Kudos for managing to fit that in there and reduce clutter.There is protection circuit for both power amplifier and headphone.  During testing I found it to frequently activate which simply turns off the unit.  It caused a lot of head scratching until I discovered the latter action.It is also I think underdesigned from cooling perspective.  When I started my DAC testing, I had the dummy load connected to the unit as well.  After a few minutes of testing I noticed the signal went away.  Then I realized per above it had shut down.  Went to touch the power button and it was hot as heck.  As was the rest of the enclosure which was super hot.  Even the top \"wood\" panel was hot to touch.   I would not rely on the 100 watt rating into 4 ohm to be a continuous rating for any length of time.The Sprout100 is rated at 100 watts into 4 ohm and according to PS Audio uses ICEPower modules.I should tell you that I hate testing multi-function devices like this.   Every subsystem takes as much time as reviewing another product with just that functionality.  In the interest of getting the review done, I did not bother to test the Vinyl input.  I also did not touch the sub out or toslink.DAC MeasurementsThe inclusion of line out allows us to test the DAC subsystem independently so let\\'s start with our dashboard there:The output was variable so I adjusted it to 2 volt.  Per my review notes above, the power amplifier was on and was whaling away into the dummy load at the same time.PS Audio rates Sprout100 as having less than 0.01% THD+N distortion from line out.  We are beating that although that is such a low bar.  Equivalent rating in SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) puts the Sprout100 in our bottom quarter of DACs reviewed:Not a good place to be although probably fits the performance target they created for themselves for \"lifestyle product\" like this.Back to our THD+N rating, we can separate the components of distortion and noise and get this ratio:They are both contributing to the final THD+N but the noise is a bit more dominant.  Likely in this small enclosure the could not get enough isolation for the DAC subsystem to reduce noise levels.The high noise level makes the jitter graph \"pretty\" with almost no spikes visible but that is because the noise floor is so elevated:Best in class DACs put that noise floor down to the bottom of the graph.Same noise problem manifests itself hugely in linearity test:That smooth, exponential rise indicates random noise polluting the voltage reading at each level.  Noise-free performance then stops around 80 dB or 13 bits -- quit a bit shy of 16 bit performance of CD.  In this day and age, I like any DAC to at least do justice to CD format, bringing fully transparency to 96 dB.Intermodulation test shows similar higher noise floor but also pretty early rising of distortion levels:Similar story for THD+N versus frequency:Dynamic range of the DAC is as spec\\'d:Speaker Amplifier MeasurementsNote: all amplifier testing except when noted, is with an AUX-0040 Audio Precision filter in place to reduce high frequency components given the fact that this is a switching amplifier design.As usual, for amplifiers I test with 5 watt output.  The trick is to know what to use for input level and volume control.  With digital input that was easy as I set the level to 0 dBFS.  But then I thought we want to know the performance of the amp alone so we better test with analog input and here is what I got:With digital input I could get over 80 dB by the way.  But no combination of input and volume level could get us there with analog input.  In some sense then the amplifier is good enough for the performance of the DAC.Frequency response showed different response in each channel:I swapped my loads and the curve did not change, indicating that the variation is due to the amplifier (filter) design, not differences in my loads.  Clearly the channel in blue is resonating around 50 kHz, causing that large boost of nearly 20 dB!  What you get with your speaker load and its wiring is unknown.  The red channel is more behaved.  We saw the same discrepancy between channels in the SINAD in the dashboard.Poking our noise into the design using high-bandwidth spectrum (FFT) analysis, we see this:Note that this is a raw test with the external filter removed.  We clearly see the switching frequency around 600 kHz peaking up to almost -20 dB.  You can have your own AM station if you like.    We have an early rise in noise before 100 kHz which is due to some kind of noise shaping.  There are a lot of other spikes which one could examine to see what is going on but I am too lazy to do so.  Regardless, these amplifiers are not pretty to look at as far as performance above audible band.  It is the price you pay for having 100 watt/channel amplifier squeezed into a little box.Speaking of power, let\\'s measure that into 4 ohm load:We get 82 watts with both channels driven which is shy of the 100 watt specification.  Noise and distortion is lower than Topping TP60 ($200) amplifier.  And there is more power.Signal to noise ratio is \"OK\":Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s jump right in with power versus distortion and noise at 300 ohms:We have competent level of power but much more noise and distortion than our reference Topping DX3 Pro ($220 when not on sale).  I like to see at least 100 milliwatts here and the Sprout100 delivers.Here is the picture at 33 ohm:We have 420 milliwatts of power until the Sprout100 shuts down causing the graph to shoot back to the left.  In other words, the unit is distortionless until it shuts down.Output impedance is a bit high at 5.7 ohms:Headphone Listening TestI started my testing with Sennheiser HD-650.  There was enough power there for a very good experience.  I could not detect any onset of distortion.Switching to Hifiman HE-400i, I got a bit more power and again, clarity and power until the end.Dedicated headphone amplifiers will produce more power but there was enough here with either headphone to give a bit of tingling to my ear lobes during bass so I was happy.  I could not get the Sprout100 to shut down with the HE-400i so in practice this may not be a serious problem.ConclusionThe reviews I read prior to testing the Sprout100 all point to how great it is that a \"high-end\" company like PS Audio has produced such a mass market product.  And that this association must be translating into excellent sound.  Our objective measurements show that this is not the case.  Performance of such subsystem as the DAC and headphone amplifier is nothing to write home about. Subjective aspects though are good: lots of power from the headphone amp and to some extent, from the power amplifier.The miss from usability is the super slow to change volume control.  In many cases I could move it a notch and nothing would happen to the output in my analyzer let alone the ears.So where do we land?  From objective performance I can\\'t say that the Sprout100 lives up to the promise of the brand.  From full functionality point of view at $599 it seems to be there though although I have yet to test many products in this category.  For this reason, I am going to withhold giving or holding back a recommendation.  Let the data guide you in that regard.',\n",
       " \" Crown XLS 1002 rack mounted pro amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new by a member and drop shipped to me.  The 1002 costs US $339 including Prime shipping from Amazon.Note: our company, Madrona Digital, is a dealer for Harman and hence Crown products.  We use fair bit of Crown amps in custom installs usually to power in-ceiling speakers and such.  Member wanted to buy it through us but the margin on it was no more than a cup of coffee (relative to online sites) so I suggested he buy it elsewhere which he did.Not sure what to say about the look other than it is made to have some style while being rugged:The LCD with bluish backlight reminds me of displays on electronics back in 1980s.  I guess at this price they had to cut every penny.I was relieved to see binding posts besides speakon connectors:Now don't laugh but I could not figure out how to pull out the safety plugs they put in the darn binding posts!  There is no way to grab then and I did not want to put a mark on them by using a sharp tool.  The manual says only European units have it but clearly that is not correct.  Anyway, I resorted to using the SpeakOn connectors for my testing.  For input I focused on XLR inputs.I set the gain to max to get the nominal 29 dB I have standardized on for testing amplifiers.There is a fan in the back and some inside.  But none came on that I could hear above the sound of my PC during testing.  Nothing shut down even when the amp was pushed into clipping.  Some kind of limiter would kick in after short period to keep the power level at max.  Temperature of the case didn't even rise above room temp.  Amplifier Audio MeasurementsPerformance was stable during a 5 minute warm up time so I ran with them:Strange to see higher order harmonics dominating the distortion profile (FFT to the right).  Ratio of noise+distortion to signal as expressed in SINAD is what I expect decent pro amps to produce:Slightly below the average of all amps tested.Signal to noise ratio is in the same range:Crosstalk is reasonable:Frequency response test shows that everything is digitized due to inclusion of DSP functionality in this amp:Power into 4 ohm is healthy as is the case with most pro amps:I was disappointed to see one channel be much worse than the other though.Letting distortion go higher we get higher power output:The burst/peak power is not higher because of the limiter I mentioned in the intro.Using 8 ohm load gives a more behaved response than 4:This indicates the one channel is starving for current than the other (likely longer path to the power supply).I was unhappy to see distortion shoot up at higher frequencies:Fortunately in practice there is not much energy up there so you will be operating in low wattage area where distortion is quite a bit lower.Finally, I removed my AES filter to get the spectrum:Switching frequency is around 380 kHz and decently attenuated.ConclusionsCompetent pro amplifiers target for good enough noise and distortion.  The Crown XLS 1002 falls in that category so if you were expecting to have anything better for so little money and so much power, you would be disappointed.  But otherwise the amp does what it targets to do.I am going to put the Crown XLS1002 on my recommended list for non-critical applications or for driving subwoofers and such.\",\n",
       " ' Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 Stereo Class D power amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member and costs US $799 (recent price increase).The GaN 5 comes in a compact enclosure with plenty of ventilation at the cost of decent looks:Beside the sole power button and blue indicator, there are two red LEDs that turn on when you power the unit on and then go off.  Strangely, when the amplifier goes into protection, they do not light up and getting the unit working again requires a power cycle.  I like to see protection circuits that self recover when the extreme condition goes away.The back panel shows binding posts that are too close together for easy fitment of my large banana speaker cables.  But I like the inclusion of balanced XLR inputs:As you see, there are also jumpers to change the gain setting although the range is not very large (26, 28 and 32).  Most of my testing was with medium gain which is as shipped.I had trouble getting the amplifier to function initially.  It would simply not output anything.  I played with grounding as I have seen some very low end amps cause AP to not be able to capture their output due to high level of noise (despite my use of AES-17 filter).  This didn\\'t work at first so I switched inputs to RCA.  That did not work either.  After some fiddling and switching back to balanced input, the amp all of a sudden started to work.  Not sure how much of this is interaction with Audio Precision or design issue.  Either way, it is an exception to the rule of 95% of amplifiers I have measured.As the name indicates, this amplifier uses the new Gallium Nitride transistors (GaN) which has some advantages over classic Mosfet transistors.  All else being equal, it can produce higher efficiency and better performance at expense of higher cost.Mini GaN 5 MeasurementsAs noted, I started my testing in medium gain which produced near nominal 29 dB which is my standard for amplifiers.  XLR input was used per introduction:Well, this is disappointing.  Distortion is fairly high causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion+noise to be worse than a number of budget desktop amplifiers:Noise performance by itself is not good either:I had trouble getting the amplifier to go to full power for the right graph.  It would shut down at just 0.7 volt input. Strangely, later on it accepted higher levels of input.  I think the impulse nature of this measurement was causing it trouble.  So maybe it can produce higher SNR at higher power but still, none of this is competitive.On the other hand, crosstalk was very good:Multitone performance was also reasonable:What is not reasonable is high dependence on speaker load when it comes to frequency response:This is just not proper.  Clearly the output filter is interacting with the load.Power measurements were quite puzzling:Notice the pull back due to some protection kicking in, likely the power supply rather than the amplifier.  I could not remotely get the power rating they specify using medium gain.  I thought maybe low gain does better but then the pull back occurred at even low power (blue and green)!  Beside lack of power, distortion is also quite high for this price class and category.  We are talking about poor Audio/Video Receiver amplifier performance!Switching to 8 ohm tamed the output a bit but power shortfall is still significant:This being the second amplifier I have recently tested with such power shortfall, I started to doubt my instrumentation.  So I pulled out my Purifi reference design and measured it.  It tracked the dashed line in the above graph from a year ago 100%.  Someone had posted this from their website:600 watts per channel??? Into 8 ohm?  This is the spec from the manual:How on earth did they measure 600 watts when the spec is 200 watts?  Strangely, that graph is nowhere to be found on their site.  There is some talk about a larger amplifier of which is a shrunk version?  Maybe that is the one that produced higher power but why does it say \"mini\" in the title of above graph?FYI, this amplifier has the green board which I understand to be the newer design.  Maybe the older red one had more power.  Hard to say.Anyway, I tried to run my max and burst power:In Burst mode, the amplifier would keep going into pull back and so I could not compute anything for that.  Likewise the THD+N vs frequency and power could not be run.  As the frequencies got lower and lower, the point where the amp would pull back would also shrink to lower and lower wattages.   What I could get did not show great transfer function.ConclusionsWhile I leave the door ever so slightly ajar to some interaction with Audio Precision, the measurements seem to indicate an amplifier that has both design issues and inability to meet specifications.  The fact that the company took away the only measurement graph makes it suspect that maybe they had have modified the design and selling something different than what they originally intended.  As it is, it is a waste of GaN technology as it brings nothing to the party but high expense.I can\\'t recommend the Premium Audio Mini GaN 5 amplifier.',\n",
       " ' \"upgraded\" TPA3221 chip based AIYIMA A05 integrated amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $80 from Amazon including Prime shipping.For a budget amplifier, the controls feel nice:As you see, tone controls are provided.  Alas, there is no detent or switch for flat response.  If you center them, you actually get too much bass.  I had to adjust them using iterative measurements to settings you see in the picture above for flat response (see measurements later in this review).A giant external power supply providing 32 volts is included which dwarfs the size of the unit itself:I dislike these little speaker terminals but they are very common in this price class.  They are too close to each other to connect beefy locking banana connectors I use for testing.Bluetooth is provided which I did not test.In use, the unit never even got warm so efficiency must be quite high.  Or else, the heat is not transmitted to the case.AIYIMA A05 MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:SINAD is dominated by distortion and ranks below average of all the amplifiers tested to date:Still, for this price and category, I think this is pretty good.Signal to noise ratio becomes good at full power:Crosstalk is decent as well:Here is our frequency response with my adjustments of the tone control:As you see we get a typical peaking of the response when I change impedance to 8 ohm.  This is due to the filter in the class D amplifier interacting with the load.  Fortunately you have tone controls here so you can compensate for it.Multitone shows best performance in mid frequencies which is a good thing compared to the alternative:Let\\'s see how much power the A05 can produce into 4 ohm load:This is much more than I expected.  We get decent amount of power even with 8 ohm:Above is with 1 kHz.  Let\\'s see how it does when we vary that:Not pretty at either high frequencies or very low.  As noted, mid frequencies do well which is good as that is where we are most sensitive.  ConclusionsGetting decent amount of power and low distortion and noise is hard in ultra low price category but the AIYIMA A05 gets there.  So I decided to grade it on a curve and give it my recommendation.',\n",
       " ' Monoprice 150 watt \"605030\" rack mountable \"pro\" stereo amplifier.  It was kindly purchased new and drop shipped to me for testing.  The 605030 costs just US $119 from Amazon including Prime shipping which is remarkably low.From a distance the unit looks like any other pro, R1U amplifier:It looks rather cheap an unattractive to me but hard to imagine any pro amp getting some kind of design award for their looks.Two gain controls are provided in the front which I appreciated.  For testing I aspire for gain of 29 dB and I almost got there at max level as shown.  That is how I tested the unit.  There overload indicators which was niceWhat I did not like one bit was the rather loud fan which runs continuously.  Monoprice, please take another $5 from me and make the fan temperature dependent please!Seeing balanced input in any amplifier at $115 price range is incredible but that is what we have here:Output is provided in the form of SpeakOn and mono 1/4 inch sockets.  Neither is convenient for in-home use but you can deal with it as I did.The loud fan did have one benefit: the amp never changed temps above the room after all my tests.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsI powered on the unit and ran the dashboard and was immediately disappointed with the very high distortion:I checked all of my connections and distortion persisted.  I almost didn\\'t run the rest of my tests but decided to do anyway.  As another 5 to 10 minutes passed, I noticed the performance had improved so I went back and re-measured the dashboard again:I have never seen an amplifier improve by 11 dB after brief warm up.  Some kind of thermal compensation is left out to save money I guess.  If the fan was not running, you could leave it running all the time but with the fan, I certainly would not.  Anyway, the ranking is still below average but at least not in the broken category:Frequency response shows anomalies in the filtering of the switching design:Depending on your speaker and its impedance, you may get accentuated highs.  There is also low frequency roll off which indicates likely capacitor coupling.Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about:Crosstalk is kind of average:Power versus distortion and noise into 4 ohm load shows unacceptable rise at higher power levels:We get the rated power and no more:Into 8 ohm performance is rather strange:Weird to see that smooth and gradual rise in distortion as if not much feedback is used.Sweeps versus different frequencies indicates the same issue as distortion rises with frequency:Finally, without my AES filter, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:Pretty ugly but levels are low and of course well above our hearing.ConclusionsThe cheap looks, loud fan, and lack of power for a pro amp was enough for me to dislike the Monoprice 605030.  Then I wondered what else you could get for so little money and there is nothing that comes close.  Hell, if this doesn\\'t work as an amp, you would get your money\\'s worth in the form of chassis, power supply, etc!Personally, I am too much of an equipment elitist to want to buy this amp.  I would pay more to get a quiet unit, with more power and slightly better looks.  But you all can decide as you want.',\n",
       " \" Starke Sound AD4.320 four channel amplifier.  It was kindly purchased by a member new and drop shipped to me.  It costs US $1,499 but they have had sales with prices as low as US $900.The Ad4.320 looks a bit industrial and is quite heavy for a class D amplifier:The reason for heavy weight is dual linear transformers and power supply on the right side.  Usually class D amplifiers use switching power supplies which keeps the unit light.  My own switching amplifier also uses a linear power supply with its weight and size penalty.I was pleased to see balanced inputs and triggers for remote on and off:As you can see, you can bridge two channels together and get double the power.  Unlike other amps that require funky connections, you have two dedicated terminals with a slide switch to select the mode (which need to be activated when power is off).  When I powered on the unit, I could not get output out of one channel.  I switched the bridge mode left and right (when off) and it got both working.  For bulk of my testing I tested channels 1 and 2.Starke Sound AD4.320 MeasurementsWe start with our usual dashboard of 1 kHz tone with a load of 4 ohm with power of 5 watts:Gain is atypically low at 21 dB (usually it is in 28 to 32 dB).  Not a problem with our dedicated DACs as they can easily provide the voltage the unit needs.  Sadly we have high 2nd and 3rd harmonics that cause SINAD to droop down to 73 dB. This is well below average of all amplifiers tested:We are talking chip-amp performance level here not anything that would come at this price range.Signal to noise ratio is better but not exciting:Multitone test shows rapid rise in distortion with frequency:The class D amplifier filter is not inside the feedback loop so shows high sensitivity to load:This means the tonality you get may depend on the actual impedance of the speaker you use.  Crosstalk between channels 1 and 2 is very good:Key performance metric for any amplifier is powered and I was very surprised to see far less power than specified:We are not even in the same planet with 104 watts vs spec  of 320!  I switched channel 2 to 3 just in case there is a power supply limit but it almost made no difference.  We are still way short of the company specs:Story repeated with 8 ohm load:Forgetting about lack of power, we also have very early rise in distortion and rising before clipping.I thought maybe they had used peak power to rate the amplifier but that is not in the same vicinity either:We do see the benefit of the linear amplifier in the way it allows higher burst power than tightly regulated switching power supplies.Sweeping the frequency and measuring power and THD+N, shows smooth lines which is good but they are quite elevated at higher frequencies:ConclusionsThe AD4.320 underperforms in so many categories.  You can argue about audibility of this and that measurements but not the lack of power. That, you will hear.  Is the unit broken?  Could be but it doesn't perform like it is broken.  I thought maybe it is set to 240 volts but it is clearly marked as being a 120 volt unit (see the back panel picture).  And at any rate, if they shipped the amp this way to a US customer, then that is what they are going to get.I can't recommend the Starke Audio AD4.320.  Getting four channels with so much power would have been a good value if they had delivered.  But when they don't, there is no reason to buy it.\",\n",
       " ' Emotiva XPA HC-1 Monoblock amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $879.As the name indicates, this is a single channel power amplifier. I have a soft spot for monoblocks and the HC-1 hits it. I especially like the power button which has buttery action and nice orange color when you hit it. Alas, then it switches to the cold, trademark blue color of Emotiva. Wish they would switch to that orange!Note that the amplifier is *very* deep, probably three times as deep as it is high.  Back panel shows nice inclusion of XLR input which is what I used for testing:The design of the amplifier is Class AB with dual power supply rails in order to keep power consumption low at lower powers. It did that as the amplifier barely generated any heat during my testing.  I was not a fan of the protection circuit though as when it clicked in (during 20 kHz sweep), it required power switch in the back to be toggled.  I like self-resetting protection circuits and if that is not possible, have the front panel be used for that purpose.If you are not familiar with my amplifier measurements, I highly suggest watching this video on amplifier measurements.Emotiva HC-1 Amplifier MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our usual 5 watt dashboard using XLR input:My eye quickly went to the high distortion products which sadly lands the HC-1 at well below average of all amplifiers tested:Even though SINAD is distortion dominated above, noise performance at 5 watts is not anything to write home about either:I like to see an amplifier above budget prices to clear 16 bit hurdle of 96 dB at 5 watts.  Or else, sensitive speakers may spit out noise.Frequency response is essentially flat in audible band and good bandwidth:Multitone test patter shines a familiar light on the amplifier when it comes to distortion:In an attempt to have more common measurements with other sites, I decided to run the 19+20 kHz intermodulation distortion (although I don\\'t know what power others use):Spray of intermodulation products around our dual tones don\\'t paint a pretty picture.Let\\'s run our power sweeps:We do have a lot of power but alas, that comes at the expensive of noise+distortion.  Allowing for 1% THD distortion, we do get a lot of power:Rail switching design (\"Class H\") shows distinct change in performance as that happens:Notice how distortion is lowest around our 1 kHz testing and increased when you go lower or higher in frequency.  The latter is kind of expected but not the lower.ConclusionsThe Emotiva brand is one of budget prices but with high performance.  Alas, after testing many of their products, the right message here is budget prices with slightly below average performance.  Company really needs to retool their products and bring up the objective performance up a notch or two.  Then they will have a winning formula.  As is, we see products like HC-1 here which underperform more than half the amplifiers ever tested (over 400).  Fortunately it is very powerful so likely sounds OK.I can\\'t recommend the Emotiva XPS HC-1 amplifier.  It is an OK amp but we are not here for OK products.',\n",
       " ' Rega IO stereo integrated amplifier with phono input.  It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $649 on Amazon including Prime shipping.  It is designed and built in UK and price there seems much more reasonable (379 pounds).The front panel doesn\\'t do much for me:It is function though with a simple input switch and power.  The inclusion of remote control is a nice touch:Courtesy of the company heritage in building turntables, it has phono input built-in.  No digital inputs  which is an odd omission in this day and age.Rega IO Amplifier MeasurementsWith power amplifiers I let them run at about 5 watts into my 4 ohm load and watch their distortion+noise to see when it stabilizes.  It did not in the case of Regao IO and contrary to audiophile belief, kept getting worse!I watched every video review of this box while waiting but it would simply not stabilize.  At around 23:00 minute, I started to sense the smell of electronics running too hot so I put my hand on it.  That was a mistake as it darn near burned it!  The sides were quite hot.  I took an IR picture of it:As you see the left and right bars run much hotter with the back end being at around 45 degrees C.  This is in open air in cool weather where we live.  Imagine what it would do at higher power delivery and when put in a cabinet.  Not good.  Company provides lifetime warranty but says it won\\'t include wear and tear.  Wonder if it cooks itself whether they repair it under warranty.Anyway, let\\'s get on with our testing starting with our dashboard:A lot of things stand out.  For starters, the channel gain is not matched.  The mismatch seemed to be volume pot independent.  Then there is the matter of very high levels of mains hum and harmonics.  No matter what I did with grounding, it would not make any difference whatsoever.   The mains noise is actually higher in energy than the harmonics.  That is not a bad thing in that our sensitivity at lower frequencies is much lower than at higher ups.SINAD sums all the noise and distortion and lands the IO in the \"fair\" category:This is well below average of nearly 79 dB.Signal to noise ratio as a result is nothing to write home about:I was surprised that despite being a simple class AB design, it doesn\\'t have flat response in audible band:Most shocking measurement was that of crosstalk:Here is our multitone test showing the impact of distortion:Company specs the amp at just 30 watts into 8 ohm and good news is that it delivers that:But this is not much power.  Here is what we get into 4 ohm:Thankfully being a class AB amplifier with unregulated power supply, it does better in burst mode:Modern speakers are built in compact enclosure that reduces their efficiency greatly.  I am not sure this is enough power.Here is our frequency stepped response:Class AB designs sport clean transfer functions and the Rega is no exception.  Typical of all amps though, you lose power at very low frequencies.  Usually you have a lot to loosing some is not super painful.  Here though, you don\\'t so that is not good news.Phono Stage MeasurementsThere is no preamp output so I decided to use the headphone output to measure the RIAA equalization:Good showing here assuming you prefer less bass to LP rumble.Headphone Output MeasurementsCompany specifies the headphone output as having an impedance of > 100 ohm which is massive.  It will cause frequency response error in vast number of headphones which have variable impedance.  And on those flat ones which tend to be low, it will dissipate a lot of power internally:This is basically a checklist feature and not something that you want to use for any serious headphone listening.ConclusionsI have a soft spot for western companies trying to compete with Asian ones in budget audio products.  Alas, performance has to be there to do the job and for the most part, it is not with Rega IO.  Capability is poor as far as power output.  Measurements like crosstalk are horrid.  Headphone output is years behind times with super high impedance.  And then we have the large amount of heat this generates.  If this were a powerful amplifier I could understand idling high but not when all you have is 30 watts into 8 ohm.  Amplifiers have a tough life and you want them to be reliable.  I am not sure how long the IO will last given the elevated temps under which it operates.I don\\'t know that this is a terrible amplifier but when test after test makes me cringe, I have no choice but to withhold recommendation for Rega IO.Edit: see teardown here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/rega-io-amplifier-teardown.27735/',\n",
       " \" AIYIMA A300 stereo amplifier with balanced and Bluetooth inputs. It was sent to me by the company and costs US $177.I like that you can easily defeat the tone controls now and select one of three inputs, allowing the amp to replace a pre-amplifier as well.Especially nice is inclusion of power supply which is a rarity in budget/small amps:The speaker terminals are small but typical for the price class.I could see an aluminum heatsink in the box for the power device/IC.  In use though, it never warmed up above room temp.  Neither the top, or the bottom registered a temperature rise which is nice.AIYIMA A300 MeasurementsLet's start with unbalanced RCA input first, setting the gain to 29 dB as with other amps I test with adjustable gain:Switching to balanced we essentially get the same performance:That distortion spike at nearly -72 dB limits SINAD to below average:In fairness and comparison to a few amplifiers with much lower gain, I also tested the amp at 12 dB gain:A bit better but still not enough to cross the average line.  For the rest of the tests, I stuck with XLR input and 29 dB gain.Here is our SNR:These are disappointing numbers relative to what AIYIMA has shown it can do.Multitone test result is not too bad:Crosstalk is good:Frequency response unfortunately shows load dependency:Key here is to see if we can get more power out of this small package and we do:Interestingly, we get almost as much with 8 ohm load!Back to 4 ohm load, with short bursts we get a lot more power:Finally, there is little frequency/power dependency which is very good for a class D amplifier:Warm Up Time MeasurementAmplifier stabilizes quickly:ConclusionsIt would have been great if the A300 had followed the footsteps of previous AIYIMA amps but with more power.  Alas, it delivers on more power at the expense of noise and distortion.  Assuming you don't hear the noise, it may be the right trade off in a budget amplifier.  On packaging, I really like the integrated box with XLR inputs.  Amplifier power supplies can be huge and that is avoided here.

It has DSP functionality which I did not test.  And is specified to drive 2 ohm load.From the outside, the XLS2502 is built like a tank:It is very light of course due to switching topology for the amplifier and power supply.  But also very sturdy with plenty of steel to keep its shape.The two gain controls are notched which gives them a nice feeling but the gain is not matched and is hard to get there using those notches.Here is the back connectivity:There is a fan as you see but in normal testing it never came up. During stress testing, it did come on but was pretty quiet compared to what I expected.  Mind you, I don\\'t think you want it close to you if it is going to be running.Alas, the fan was insufficient to keep the unit cool under full power.  The red thermal indicators came up even though the fan was running.  The amp seemed to be functioning still but to be on the safe side, I terminated my testing there.  In typical home use, even for subwoofer duty, I doubt that this is a concern as you will see later as far as what wattage we are talking about.Overall, the impression of the amplifier is positive, making you think you have something made to be run over by a car and still function reliably.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load at 5 watts:I set the gain to 29 dB for consistency.  I also tested it at 19 dB gain and it only made 1 to 2 dB improvement.  The reason is that SINAD (signal relative to noise+distortion) is dominated by harmonic distortion.  Here, those harmonics are very high order which perceptually is not very good as they are not masked as easily.  Anyway, with a SINAD of 71 dB, we have below average performance:The XLS1502 did a bit better in this regard, garnering a SINAD of 77 dB.Frequency response shows the same sharp cut off:I don\\'t know if this can be changed using DSP programming or not.Above is with resistive load.  Switching to a simulation of a 2-way speaker gets us little difference:So there is some speaker dependency but I would not lose sleep over it.Crosstalk is OK but could be better:The red line is a $30 amplifier by the way.32-tone test signal simulating \"music\" gives a more hopeful picture of distortion:The spray of harmonics is high in frequency where our hearing threshold is higher.Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts but gets better at full power:Lower gain settings may improve this a few dBs.Amplifier Power MeasurementsYou don\\'t buy this amplifier to listen at 5 watts so let\\'s see what it can do when its wings are given enough room to fly:Wow!  Nearly 500 watts of power is delivered into both channels simultaneously.  The good news doesn\\'t end there. Check out these ratings when distortion is relaxed to 1%:1600 watts of peak power is delivered out of standard 120 volt outlet!  These thing is a powerful beast.Noise level is decent but I wanted to make sure the high gain was not impacting it.  So I reduced gain to 19 dB which required some 6 volts of input to drive to clipping:There is no difference at all.For the rest of these tests I stayed at 19 dB gain.  Here is the power output with 8 ohm:Over 300 watts at what should be inaudible distortion for most people.Finally we get to my stress test.  I played with the settings because the high frequency noise shaping would not let me perform the sweep.  So I decided to change this test and set the limit to 22.4 kHz (instead of usual 90 kHz) and limit the sweep to 6 kHz.  That way, the third harmonic of 6 kHz (18 kHz) is still included in the computation.  No music has full power at high frequencies anyway so I don\\'t think we need to keep measuring to 20 kHz with respect to power.  Here is the output:As noted, the red warning lights came on as the sweep was going from right to left so I terminated the test.  Delivered output was about 520 watts which is still plenty but is naturally lower than 1 kHz which was in high 600s.ConclusionsThese pro amps have mastered the technique of delivering tons of power with distortion and noise kept under control.  Lack of power is the #1 reason an amplifier can sound bad.  Don\\'t care how good the SINAD is at 5 watt.  If you run out of power, you will hear distortion, lack of dynamics, etc.  So if you need the power, it is best to get it than to have less of it.  And on that front, the Crown XLS 2502 delivers tons of it, breaking all previous records for any amplifier I have tested.  The price is ridiculously low for the amount of power you get as well.Ideally, you would use more finessed amplifiers above bass frequencies and use the XLS 2502 to drive the subs.  But if not, the XLS2502 can deliver good performance.Overall, I am going to recommend the XLS 2502.',\n",

Parts Express is selling it for US $650 right now.The APA1200DSP has nicer look than typical pro amplifiers:The back is especially nice with the type of connectivity you need in a home system:Both analog and digital inputs are provided.  Ethernet input allows a nicely done web interface to be used from anywhere:There is a microphone I believe and ability to automatically calibrate the room response.  I did not use or dive into this functionality.There is a fan that came on when powered on but nicely powered down gradually and I did not hear it during operation.  When it runs it has a lower frequency and a bit less annoying than on pro amplifiers.There is a strange setting for 2 vs 4 ohm speaker load.  I set it to 4 since I tested it at 4 and 8 ohms.  Manual doesn't say exactly what this does.APA1200DSP Amplifier MeasurementsI set the gain to -10 dB which gave me the nominal 29 dB I look for and measured using XLR input:Switching to digital input showed essentially the same performance:This level of noise+distortion (SINAD) puts this amp way down in our rankings:Noise level was not very good either, using analog or digital input:Unit was stable on power up which is good:Crosstalk was decent:Multitone suffered from high noise floor and sporadic distortion spikes:Sadly frequency response is highly load dependent due to class D amp's output filter interacting:We also see sharp cut off due to internal processing being at low sampling rate.  Switching to digital input at 96 kHz sampling made no difference:The name indicates it produces 1200 watts.  Let's see what it can do into 4 om with both channels driven:The curve wiggles as protection circuit kicks in.  Prior to that, it produced 370 watts.  Letting distortion rise to 1% didn't do much better:Switching to 8 ohm naturally cut the power substantially:Stepping through the test frequency shows a number of odd behaviors:ConclusionsTypical of this class of amplifier, power specs are mostly imaginary.  Objective measurement of noise and distortion are also typical with little attention paid to minimize them.  So you are left with buying this for functionality not because it has any great implementation of class D amplification.I can't recommend the Dayton Audio APA1200DSP DSP based on its pure measured performance.

The rear of the amp is a bit unusual in placing the mains input between the connectors:Would have thought to put the IEC jack all the way to the left and speaker to the right.  Doesn't matter if the performance is good anyway.Is this the first audio product we have tested from Serbia?Vista Audio Spark MeasurementsI had to crank the volume all the way up to get close to my nominal 29 dB gain (per THX spec):Boy, that is a lot of power supply noise.  Playing with grounding reduced the spikes at 60 Hz a bit but did nothing to the harmonics which are caused by the internal power supply.  Even if that was low, the distortion spikes are not.  As a result, the amplifier rates quite low in our overall ranking:Signal to noise ratio is better than what we saw in the dashboard indicating the noise floor rises with power:I was surprised to see a bass roll off in this day and age where just about every amplifier is dc-coupled:Multitone shows a messy response with the lows polluted by the power supply and highs due to inadequate feedback:Crosstalk is below average:The amplifier is rated at only 20 watts but I was not able to get that:It did better actually with 8 ohm load indicating current delivery is its issue:Back to 4 ohm, if you allow more distortion or buRst the input, you do get a bit more power:Finally, there is fair bit of variability when we sweep frequencies:ConclusionsSometimes I really wonder what appeal such amplifiers have that attract buyers.  This amp has too little power to drive most speakers and has a lot of noise and distortion as well.  There must be some mystique about it that I don't understand.Needless to say, I can't recommend the Vista Audio Spark II amplifier.  I hope the designer sees these measurements and at least works to sharply reduce the power supply noise as that can't be anything good no matter what school you are from.\",\n",
       " ' Parasound Zamp V.3 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The version I have is a revision or two older than what Parasound builds (I think).  The latest version is being sold on Amazon for US $277 including Prime shipping.  Considering this is a brand name company and we have a class AB amplifier, this seems like a reasonable price.The Zamp V.3 comes in a tiny and rather cute, half-rack package:In addition to power button, you also have a headphone jack.  From the bit I have read, the output is just the amplifier with a resistor inline.  This means its output impedance is high (not good) and likely noisy as well.  I did not test it.The back panel exposes good bit of control not seen on \"normal\" hifi amplifiers:Parasound has a leg in two industries: the Custom Integration (CI) channel and hifi.  The former is for companies who install these amplifiers in hide-away places to for example power a couple of speakers for a bedroom TV.  The gain controls and such give flexibility to this kind of installation as does the small form factor (the amp could be hidden behind a flat panel TV.  Being part of this channel means that when the automation is redone in a home using it, these units are ripped out and put on sale at low prices.  I see this amp advertised for as little as $149 on ebay.I was shocked when I read that this amp was class AB and after I looked inside and saw a heavy and large pancake toroidal transformer.   How the heck did they put in inefficient class AB amp in there with no heatsinking that was visible?  The answer came to me after I let the unit warm up for a little over 5 minutes at 5 watts being output from each channel.  The amp went dead and displayed a thermal overload!  It can\\'t produce just 10 watts for five minutes?  No, it can\\'t. I touched the bottom of the amp and it nearly burned my hand.  A narrow painted strip of metal fastened to the chassis carries the brunt of heat generated.  Being on the bottom and having no fins means that the heat is not spread at all resulting in overheating.  I put a cooling fan on it and it took a good 2 to 3 minutes to come back to life.  And I ran the rest of the tests that way.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWell, this ain\\'t a pretty sight.  One channel is much worse than the other.  No amount of playing with the grounding, or messing with the switch in the back helped with any of the mains/power supply related tones either.  The averaged ranking is below mean of all of the amps tested so far (77 amplifiers to date!):Crosstalk was poor, matching a $25 amplifier I tested:Frequency response is OK:Noise performance as you can predict from the dashboard is not fantastic:Amplifier Power MeasurementsLet\\'s get into the most important bit which is power capability starting with 4 and going into 8 ohms:Weird how one channel goes crazy at just 1 to 2 watt.  Specs are matched though.Allowing for higher distortion of 1% doesn\\'t help with max power but does give us more burst power:Thermal StabilityHere is the test that resulted in the shutdown:I was messing with grounding and caused that little blip so ignore that.ConclusionsI really like the cute and small form factor of this amp for desktop use.  Alas, with a weak thermal management, it won\\'t produce much volume before shutting down.  Used ones have probably had a hard life due to this reason as well.  If you are going to play with one and want to shy away from the million switching amplifiers out there in this price range, go ahead.  But I can\\'t recommend the unit.',\n",

The A-U671 costs US 499 but most vendors say it is no longer available even though it shows as current on Yamaha site.  How fast modern gear becomes obsolete...Yamaha has been clever to mimic the look of 1970s and 1980s switchgear:Alas, the controls are plastic and don't have nearly the nice feel of their old brethren.  The volume control is motorized though and is operable through the remote. A built-in DAC and analog input would nicely satisfy many people.  Unfortunately the unit arrived with something rattling in it. I took it part to find out it was a clamp of sort for the power supply bundle that had come loose.  I put it back together and all worked except the USB DAC.  I could control it, change its sample rate and such but it would not produce audio (with stock or Yamaha driver).  Another one of the power supply screws was also loose.  They should have put thread lock on them so that they don't come loose. The back panel is as expected but with decent quality speaker terminals:Since I had to take the unit apart anyway, here is a quick teardown:The DAC is on top and the amp on the bottom of the green board.  The yellow board is the switching power supply.  And that black wrapper is what had come lose.In use the amp was very quick to shut down on overload.  It would actually power off telling me it may be the power supply that is undersized. Temperature rise is not remotely an issue. Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual we start with our dashboard of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load @ 5 watts:I set the volume control manually to 29 dB as I normally do with integrated amps.  SINAD which represents the worst of noise and/or distortion is dominated by distortion.  At 70 dB, this is well below average:Signal to noise ratio is nothing to write home about either:Crosstalk is good (one channel bleeding into another):Frequency response is problematic, showing that it changes with your speaker load:Multitone shows frequency dependent error and high noise floor:Here are the power ratings:The regulated switching power supply allows no headroom:Thermal StabilityNot a whole lot changed with warm-up:ConclusionsI have a soft spot for the look of the Yamaha A-U671.  And inclusion of a USB DAC in a light and compact enclosure.  Not much else to hang your hat on from there on.  If you can find one at a yard sale for $100 it would be a good purchase.  I don't know that I would buy it over so many other modern choices with Room EQ and streaming built-in.\",\n",
       " ' Naim Uniti Atom streamer, DAC and integrated amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $3,799.The overall industry design is attractive and has a high-end look to it.  Alas, every part of the unit has an ultra sharp edge from heatsinks to edges of the plexiglass (?) front panel.  It is a heavy box which makes you really feel those sharp edges as if they are going to tear into your skin.  It was unpleasant every time I had to move or rotate the unit.The front panel is large and sharp which I like.  Alas, and strangely so, it is not a touch screen.  In this day and age and at this price, a touchscreen is a requirement in my opinion.  A very large rotary control managed the volume.  It seem to have some kind of acceleration but wasn\\'t very intuitive.Here is the back panel:I was surprised to see the compact binding posts that are made only for banana plugs.  Likewise there is no USB B to use the unit as a DAC.  Maybe you can use the type-A connector for that but even so, it is very unusual choice.  Nice to see a floating ground switch.  In my testing, it only impacted the networked tests.  Otherwise it had no effect.Inclusion of HDMI is very important to allow sound from TV to be piped into it.Upon booting and with Ethernet cable plugged in, it nicely told me there is new firmware.  It took something like 10 minutes to download the image and then went into a seemingly infinity cycles of booting, dark screen, non-descript progress bar and power button that would fade on or off or solid on.  I left there for probably half hour when it finally seem to be ready.There is the usual app to control it but I opted for the included remote control.  It too has very sharp edges but otherwise functional.Naim Uniti Atom DAC MeasurementsI started by testing the unit using Coax due to lack of type-B or type-c USB port.  Here is our usual dashboard:Distortion dominates causing our SINAD (noise+distortion) to barely reach into \"fair\" category:Distortion rises into the noise floor of even 16 bit content so not a good first showing.  As noted, changing the grounding mode made no difference in any of these measurements.The output stage is capable of higher voltage which is nice:Good to see the output does not become all distorted once the internal amplifier is pushed beyond clipping. Noise performance is not competitive with even budget DACs but almost good enough for 16-bit playback:Multitone distortion was quite high:Jitter display looks clean but noise floor is high and is masking interference patterns:Levels of those spurious tones though is quite low and inaudible (-128 dB).We have a rather odd filter response:This partially contributes to rather poor noise+distortion relative to frequency:Finally, linearity matches the fair performance of the rest of the system:Naim Uniti Atom Amplifier MeasurementGiven the choice of analog or digital input, I tested both which producing 5 watts:Performance is very close so I opted to use analog in as that makes the comparison to other amps easier.  Notice the high power supply noise at 120 Hz (double mains frequency in US).  Overall ranking is well below average:Frequency response test with analog input shows a brick wall filter which indicates input is being digitized:Shame then that no DSP functionality is provided.  The roll off filter in the ADC causes some drooping in the high frequencies.Crosstalk response was kind of shaky but overall good:Multitone test once again shows less than optimal performance:Rated power is low and that is what we see:Sweeping the frequency for power measurement we get orderly response:Notice the typical sharp drop in power at 20 Hz.  This is why you need more powerful amplifier than you think you are getting.  Power is needed in bass but the reservoir capacitors in the power supply get depleted and you don\\'t get as much output.Naim Unit Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsI expected the headphone output to be \"junk\" but it actually is not:That is plenty of output for satisfactory response of high impedance headphones.  Noise floor is not competitive with any modern/recommended headphone amp but could have been far worse.  At 32 ohm though, available power is much more limited:Sweeping the load we see that the headphone amplifier is not capable of much current delivery:So best to stay with high impedance headphones.Naim Uniti Atom Streaming MeasurementsI ran the streaming tests a day later and here, I noticed noise bleeding into the output:So I tried the ground lift switch and it remedied that:SINAD though is dominated by high distortion so didn\\'t matter one way or the other.  And performance is the same as local/coax S/PDIF input.ConclusionsPerformance of Naim Atom ranges from fair/adequate to rather poor.  Shame that when you pay so much for a piece of audio, not much design hygiene is included.  I suspect more went into software development and enclosure design than making sure the hardware is performant.  I hope for a version 2 the company works to substantially improve the performance of these subsystems.  I am sure many buy a Naim product thinking they are getting great audio performance.I can\\'t recommend the Naim Uniti Atom streaming amplifier.P.S.  I was going to give the mailman panther rating to the unit but he is out making deliveries......',\n",
       " ' vintage Audio Research D300 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a local member.  The D300 came out circa 1995 and initially cost US $3,500 but then price rose to US $4,000.  Quick search shows used ones going for US $1,500.The D300 is built like a tank:I am confident you could drive over it and nothing will happen to it.  Even the handles are massive which is a blessing as an ultra heavy transformer sits vertically behind the front panel. I could carry the D300 by myself so it is not too heavy to be unmanageable. The back panel is as you expect:With one exception: the non-detachable power cord.   What is there though seems amply sufficient as it is supple yet quite thick.Heatsinks are very thick gauge and in use, they got warm but not hot.  The rest of the case got warm as well.  The amp never complained no matter what I did to it in testing.Overall, if you want an understated but high quality feel, that is what you have in D300.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:Ouch.  Lots of second harmonic causing SINAD which is the sum of distortion and noise to be rather poor.  As such the D300 lands well below average in our list of some 62 amplifiers tested to date:Noise performance was quite good though so it is the distortion that is the problem:32-tone test signal representing \"music\" showed what we already know as far as rather high distortion levels:Frequency response was excellent:As was crosstalk (one channel bleeding into the other):Let\\'s get into the meat of the measurements with power vs THD+N starting at 4 ohm:Boy, this is worse than the dashboard indicated.  Almost immediately, distortion takes over and keeps climbing.  While the D300 is much more quiet, it quickly loses to an integrated home theater receiver (NAD T758)!  Not good.Same story repeats for 8 ohm load:Distortion is so high at higher power levels that if we set a limit of 0.1% for THD+N, we only get 60 watts out of each channel!Relaxing that to 0.2% though gave us a lot more power and no indication of frequency mattering.  This was proven yet again in our multiple sweeps:All the lines fall on top of each other indicating the amp just doesn\\'t care what frequency you feed it.  It amplifies it, adds a heap of distortion and that is that. Makes you want to cry and celebrate at the same time!ConclusionsThere is clear excellence in the engineering in Audio Research D300.  Build quality is superb as well.  There must have been a conscious decision to use low amount of feedback which translated into rising distortion with power.  It is a shame that capable designers follow audiophile myths to build non-performant amplifiers when they could do so much better.In this day and age, this type of performance is not competitive so I really can\\'t recommend the D300.  Then again if you want something with high build quality and can get the unit on the cheap, it makes for a decent option.',\n",
       " \" Topping PA3 desktop amplifier.  I have had a ton of requests to measure this amplifier so I asked the company to send me one.  They said they would do so but cautioned me that it would not measure well.  The PA3 costs US $120 on Amazon including free shipping.I must stay, compared to all the budget amplifiers I have tested, the PA3 looks like luxury goods!  It comes in a hefty case and oozes quality:There are dual inputs as you see which you can control using the power button.  A massive, Topping branded external power supply is provided which even goes as far as having textured design on the back side:Most importantly, all the regulatory certifications are there which we know from past examination to be true and certified by third-party labs.  This is one budget amplifier I wouldn't hesitate to leave on unattended.Implementation is based on TDA7498E ST Micro chip amp.  Topping PA3 MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard of 5 watts into 4 ohm using 1 kHz tone:As you see I adjusted the volume control to give us the nominal 29 dB gain I usually test at.  SINAD is dominated by distortion which at 0.036% which correlates well with ST Micro's 0.05% spec at 1 watt.  Alas, this is well below average for all amplifiers we have tested and some of the latest chip amp products:SNR slots in the same bucket of performance:Crosstalk is pretty good showing good attention to isolation:Frequency response unfortunately is very load dependent:We get about 51 watts into 4 ohm with both channels driven with distortion dominating (hence the reason the graph doesn't slope down):Power naturally drops with 8 ohm load but not as much some others I have seen:Peak power matches company spec which is a novelty in this space:Note that there was a really strong protection circuit that would not allow me to push the amp more than I did for max power so I had to settle for lower distortion of 0.5%.  It would shut down if I told it to work harder to hit 1%.Distortion takes off rather quickly with frequency as we see in multitone test:Same is see in our frequency versus power and distortion+noise:Fortunately our hearing threshold starts to go up at higher frequencies so audibility is less impacted than our sensibility about good engineering.ConclusionsIt is clear that Topping did what it could to build a reliable, safe and robust desktop platform for this amplifier.  Alas, they are held down significantly by the performance of the underlying chip amp which is likely all that was available at the time this product was designed.  Being selfish elitist audiophile engineering types that we are, we have no choice but to pass on this amplifier.  If you are not picky however and want something that is build safe and well, you could choose otherwise.So to repeat, I can't recommend the Topping PA3 based on its audio performance.  Hopefully there are future products based on a better platform.\",\n",

It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $1,599.The front panel of the Sphinx portrays a high-end look with its thick metal:Alas, that thin metal surrounding it, takes that impression away.  I liked the very wide apart inputs and output terminals which \"should\" bode well for crosstalk measurements:There is good bit of weight to the unit courtesy of power transformer.  I like the inclusion of the balance control.  As you see in the first picture, I had to use it to get same gain out of both channels.  Protection circuit was well done with automatic recovery and worked great no matter how hard I pushed it.Internal amplification is provided by a pair of Hypex UCD 180 OEM class D amplifiers.  A buffer state made out of tubes completes the picture.The amplifier has won many accolades as indicated by their mention on the product page:Let\\'s see if objectively they are right.Rogue Audio Sphinx V3 MeasurementsAs usual, I set the gain to 29 dB and feed the amp a 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm at 5 watts and see what we get:What we get is not very nice.  Broad set of harmonics to the tune of -80 dB do away with any notion of \"tube sound.\"  Add fair bit of noise and SINAD which is a measure of distortion+noise sinks quite low:That\\'s 10 dB worse than the media across 140 amplifiers tested so far.  Not good.  As a reference, Hypex specifications shows a SINAD of 84 dB so 15 dB was lost in the addition of the buffer stage in this amplifier.Another thing that is not good is signal to noise ratio:So even at full power your 2 bits short of CD\\'s dynamic range. The shocker was the normally \"innocent\" crosstalk test which just about every amplifier does well in:Then comes Sphinx, losing to our $20 throw-away amplifier!  Clearly zero attention was paid to isolation of the two channels.Frequency response also shows sloppy attention to producing the audible band properly:Let\\'s measure our power vs distortion:Definitely much less happy driving 4 ohm load.  Here is our peak and max power:So moderately powerful although without much headroom.ConclusionsRogue Audio takes a perfectly serviceable Hypex UcD 180 amplifiers and adds copious amount of noise and distortion with its front-end.  Mind you, despite use of the tube, it doesn\\'t give that 2nd harmonic dominant result.  It just raises the noise and distortion, robbing you of transparency.  But hey, folks buy audio products by how many myths are included in their design and Rogue audio gets there with that tube stage.  Perfect marketing, poor engineering.  Story of high-end audio.Needless to say, I can NOT recommend the Rogue Audio Sphinx V3.  You can get plenty of better amplifiers for this level of money.',\n",

It costs US $399.As pro amplifiers go, the NX3000D is half attractive especially when on with its amber lights and LEDs:There are variable (analog) gains as you see.  I did not play with the DSP or menu system but it lets you do such useful things as setting up a crossover to drive a sub.  There is built-in power limiting in there.The unit is quite light.  So light that you think it may fly away given its large and noisy fan:The fan unfortunately is not temperature sensitive and wails away upon power up!  I am sure saving weight is a big deal when you try to squeeze every dollar out of shipping costs.  Good news is that as they advertise, this thing runs as cool as it can get.  After a bunch of testing, the temperature was the same as the room.Note that speaker connections are SpeakOn which I like but not common in consumer audio.  Inputs are only balanced XLR/1/4 combo.  There is extra gain though to use RCA unbalanced with them using an adapter.  Where I placed the gain knobs provided 29 dB of gain.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amp 1 kHz and see what else it outputs beside that at 5 watts into 4 ohm test load:What it outputs is a bunch of distortion in the form of third harmonic at 3 kHz placing the unit well below average:Note also the disparity in channel output which you can also see in the frequency response measurement:The gain controls are notched so not easy to select any in-between gains to adjust for this.Another news is how narrow the bandwidth is.  Being a DSP amplifier, it digitizes the input and it seems to use 48 kHz sampling resulting in bandwidth of 24 kHz.Noise performance is not that great at 5 watts, falling well below 96 dB we like to see for CD/streaming 16-bit content:Fortunately at full power (right), you do clear that hurdle.These amps are sold almost exclusively by how much power they produce versus their cost so let\\'s get into that with 4 ohm load:Seems like the rated power numbers are a fantasy unless they are measured for one channel driven, not two as I do.  Still, 400 watts is lots of power in such a cheap package.  You get a  bit more as well if you allow the distortion to rise to 1% and also measure it as a peak (right):Switching the load to 8 ohms naturally lowers available power:Switching/class-D amps can have complex distortion profiles that highly depend on frequency and power level and we see some of that here:At higher frequencies different distortion mechanisms become dominant causing the curves to go up and down. While I always see some power loss at 20 Hz, it is disappointing to see it dip so low to just 268 watts for an amplifier rated at \"900 watts.\"  Bass is where we need the power.Finally, we can remove our filter and examine the ultrasonic spectrum to see what the amp is producing there:Switching frequency seems to be around 410 kHz which is well above the audible band, and is attenuated quite a lot for a switching amplifier (-26 dB).  I am not too happy to see so much other junk there though although not audible per se.ConclusionsPro amps can often make good alternative to hi-fi amps since they are sold at much lower cost/watt than consumer products.  We get that in Behringer NX3000D but we also get the other drawbacks of pro products in the form of high fan noise.  And distortion that is pretty high.  If you can hide it some place and use it to do drive a subwoofer it should be fine.  But otherwise, I think a more quiet amplifier would work better for home hifif than this unit.Overall, the Behringer NX3000D is not my cup of tea for home use so I can\\'t recommend it.',\n",
       " ' Luxman SQ-N150 hybrid integrated amplifier with phono stage. It is on kind loan from a member and costs US $3,295.Can you say pretty? I knew you could!  Love the elegant front panel with VU meter. Nice set of balance and tone controls are provided as well:As you can see, power amplification is provided through ECC83 triode drivers going to EL84 power tubes. Amplifier is conservatively designed and is rate at just 10+10 watts into 6 ohms. I like the look without the cage but here it is with:Not much exciting in the back other than modern, beefy speaker terminals than that of vintage tube amplifiers:The package is smaller than one imagines but weighs a hefty 27 pounds.  Notice the AC terminal doesn\\'t have earth ground and unit is double insulated. In testing I found no effect from earthing the unit or not.Front-end and pre-amps are solid state:Luxman SQ-N150 Amplifier MeasurementsWhen I picked 5 watts as my standard for measuring amplifiers, it was usually a fraction of the amplifier power but here it is nearly half the available power!  So relatively speaker, distortion plays a much strong role than it would otherwise:The high second and third harmonics set the stage as far as SINAD (due to push-pull design) but I wish there was not so much power supply noise.  Sadly the amplifier takes up the ranking of second worst amplifier I have ever measured as far as distortion+noise:Those power supply spikes set the lower bound for dynamic range:It is not too bad but you likely will use very sensitive speakers with this low power amplifier so the numbers may manifest themselves more than they usually do.Frequency response is extended but shows a kink indicating some kind of filter:Crosstalk does not follow the usual curve indicating some sort of resistive (?) element between the two channels:Normally the issue is capacitive which causes the two reference lines you see.Multitone which is supposed to resemble \"music\" with its 32 tone, shows strong level of \"grass\" (intermodulation distortion):Hard to make a case that you are hearing more detail when so much is masked at this power level.I don\\'t have a 6 ohm load so used my usual 4 and 8 ohm loads for power testing:Edit: forgot to post the different frequency sweeps:Luxman SQ-N150 Phono Stage MeasurementsThe amplifier noise and distortion dwarfs the phono stage so I only checked its frequency response:So very good on this critical measurement.Luxman SQ-N150 Headphone MeasurementsFor same reason as above, I just made a power measurement:Seems usable from power availability point of view but noise and distortion are quite high.  Company specifies 16 ohm output impedance and wisely recommends against using low impedance headphones for good reason:The headphone amplifier is simply connected to the amplifier output using the aforementioned resistor which eats up all the power.  It will also change the frequency response of your headphone if it is not flat.  So best to be avoided.Luxman SQ-N150 Listening TestsMy lab speaker is an infinity R253 which has a sensitivity of 87 dB.  I connected it to the SQ-N150 and started to listen.  I had to immediately acknowledge the lack of power as the volume control not only maxed out but there was so much distortion as to cause crackling noise.  I backed off to moderate listening level and the sound was OK but I noticed boominess in the lows as if you have more room modes than you do.  To confirm, I switched to Topping PA5 amplifier on my bench and boominess was gone.  Likely the harmonic distortion of the amplifier is hitting on more room modes causing extra bass/boominess.  I can see if your speakers/setup lacks bass that you experience a bit more of it.The volume control had to be kept below 12:00 o\\'clock.  By 1:00 o\\'clock distortion would start to set in and sound would start to get grungy and rough.  Past 2:00 o\\'clock it would be rather obvious and beyond that, unusable.  There was usable volume with me sitting 5 feet from the single speaker.  With two speakers you could double that but it is still not enough power for me with this speaker.  If an audio reviewer can\\'t hear this level of distortion, they should give up testing audio gear.  Sadly none of the reviews I read made a remark about the distortion.  It is the classic case of paying a lot more and getting a lot less fidelity and enjoyment.ConclusionsThe high level picture here is very clear: wonderful looking, and presumably well built amplifier.  The problem is using tube technology and producing so little power. I see no advantage to it, euphonically or otherwise.  But it is possible for some people the bass impact is a positive.  But at what cost?  So much spent with so little dynamic capability due to lack of power.Needless to say I can\\'t recommend the Luxman SQ-N150. ',\n",
       " 'This is a review and detailed measurements of Optoma/NuForce STA-200 Power Amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  I see it listed for USD $499 including Prime shipping.  Looking elsewhere, it appears to have a list price of $1299.This is one attractive enclosure that does not usually come in a $500 package:The finish is slightly textured and looks pretty nice.Feature wise, there is nothing there but a set of RCA inputs and speakers.  The RCA inputs are paired with speaker terminals on each end of the unit so you better have RCA cables that separate that much.Somewhat out of character is a traditional extruded aluminum heatsink poking out the back.   I guess this avoids having to put the heatsink inside and having to vent the enclosure.  The heatsink is pretty small though and it was cooking even when testing the unit at just 5 watts/channel.  I worry about its ability to run OK at full power for any extended amount of time.Rated power is 80 watts/channel with 8 ohm load.  My testing was at 4 ohm however.Let\\'s get into measurements and see how she does.MeasurementsAs with my previous amplifier tests, let\\'s start with a dashboard view of the unit while it was outputting 5 watts:Boy, this is disappointing.  We have tons of mains and power supply components (which I reduced somewhat by grounding one leg of the speaker terminals to my AP analyzer).  The dominant distortion components are the cause of poor SINAD though with the second harmonic peaking up to nearly -70 dB.  So even if the rest were not there, the SINAD would remain the same.Company states THD+N of < 0.03% and we are essentially there so our testing is correct.  The write-up brags about response up to 1 Mhz and such.  I suspect instead of using fair amount of feedback to bring the distortion down, they have traded for wider bandwidth. Looking at the power rating versus distortion, the STA-200 doesn\\'t bring much to the party over the much cheaper Topping TP60 ($199):Yes, there is less noise at lower power levels but by the time we get to 1 watt, they equalize in performance and at limit, the Topping TP60 (red) actually has less distortion.The spec says the signal to noise ratio is 100 dB.  My measurements fall somewhat short of that:Likely the mains intrusion is the cause (which would vary from installation to installation).Sweeping input level and measuring IMD we get:As with THD, the STA200 has good bit less noise than Topping TP-60 but then suddenly clips and clips badly.  Looking at the gain we see why:This is a lot of gain for a low power amplifier.  No wonder sensitivity is spec\\'ed at just 0.45 volt (versus nominal 2 volts).  This means if you may have to significantly turn down the volume in your pre-amp/dac+pre.  This would make for an amp that plays loud due to its high gain and perhaps that is a conscious choice.Frequency response is reasonable to 40 kHz (0.3 dB down):Anyway, I think we have enough here to know the merits of this amplifier.ConclusionsI was pretty depressed when I reviewed the Topping TP60 and FX Audio FX502SPro and had high hopes that the NuForce STA200 would easily outperform them.  Such was not the case.  The Topping TP60 at less than half the price essentially matches its performance.  It also runs substantially cooler than this unit.  It doesn\\'t look quite as nice though although it has a more manageable desktop form factor if that is how you use it.The NuForce ST-200 seems to cater the audiophile myth of \"fast\" and high-bandwidth amplifiers, sacrificing fidelity to get there.  This is a poor trade off in my book when just about all the content we play is quite band limited.',\n",
       " ' Sabaj A1 desktop (small) amplifier.  It was kindly sent to me by a member.  Not sure if it is still in production but you can still find it for $60 or so.  Main interest in testing this unit is the use of the TPA3118 class D amplifier which is used in all kinds of other devices including Genelec 8030c powered monitor!For the price the enclosure is not half bad:A little LED display shows the active input (there are two) and current volume level.  As is typical, a laptop sized power supply provides the juice:The unit runs cool.  If you overtax it, it will reset and power back on at low output level.Sabaj A1 MeasurementsAs usual we start with our 5 watt dashboard:As you see I set the gain to 29 dB which is the \"standard\" I use for integrated amplifiers.  Resulting SINAD is dominated by distortion and is well below average for all amps tested:But... if you compare it to other low cost amps in this price bracket, performance is a good 10 dB better.Noise performance is in the same class:Frequency response is not flat but good to see it rolling off as opposed to peaking:Crosstalk is what you expect in this type of device:Most important is power and this is how the A1 did into 4 ohm:Not a whole lot of power I am afraid.  Pushing it harder didn\\'t do any good either:The power supply runs out of juice and the device shuts down.  May do better with a more powerful power supply.  Here it is into 8 ohm:ConclusionsAs a class I expect these cheap amps to be broken.  The A1 is not that bad.  My concern is too little power.  Many small speakers are inefficient and you need more than 20 watts to get decent performance out of them.  My suggestion is to save on spending money on food and flowers and save up for a better amp.  But if you can\\'t, the Sabaj A1 may do the job for you.As it is, I can\\'t recommend the Sabaj A1.  I am too much of an audio/technology snob to go for it!',\n",
       " ' Pyle PT8000CH 8-channel or 8-zone distribution power amplifier. It was kindly drop shipped by a member and costs US $269. Member purchased it for just $158 on sale!You probably can\\'t tell from the picture but this is a massive box.  It weighs over 50 pounds/23 kilograms and is quite deep.  Rack mounts are provided and needed for both front and back. A review says the back holes don\\'t align right however.  Back panel shows why this amplifier is also tailored for multi-room distribution:\\\\By selecting \"bus mode,\" a single input is distributed to any number of channels from 1 to 8.  In mono or stereo.  Trim pots are provided to adjust the gain for each channel although there were kind of too sensitive to set accurately.The side panels gave me paus until I powered the unit:I feared that those fans would make huge amount of noise but to my pleasant surprise, they barely move and are essentially silent.  They never sped up or got louder during testing.  This is far better solution than my pro amps I test with loud and small fans that are not even temperature sensitive.Back to the front, the power switch is quite bright (blue) and bleeds into the LED bar graphs.  But once the unit is on, the LED bar graphs themselves light up and more or less cover that issue.  The power switch feels quite solid.Pyle as a brand is know for cheap (read junk) so my expectations were not high going into the review.  The overall construction though, with dual toroidal transformers in front, portrayed a different picture.  Let\\'s see how it measures.Pyle PT8000CH MeasurementsI stayed with stereo measurements for this section selecting the channels 7 and 8 that are next to the AC power input.  Warm up allowed the amp to improve a bit:Here is our dashboard:We have a spray of harmonic distortion that sinks SINAD fairly low:Zooming in:We see that the company that it keeps is not too bad!  SNR falls inline or perhaps a bit better:Multitone is as we would expect from the dashboard:Frequency response is good although I wished for a bit more bandwidth as to get a flatter response to 20 kHz:Crosstalk though was surprisingly poor:Let\\'s see how much power we have into 2 channels:Benefit of large power supply comes in when just driving in stereo:Here is 8 ohm performance (company spec = 100 watts):Finally, here is power vs frequency:Here is on/off noise:I hooked up the amplifier to an infinity R253 speaker and I could hear a faint pop on power up.  Power off seemed silent although the fan noise may have masked that.Multichannel Amplifier TestingMy analyzer is only stereo but I drove all channels with the same 8 ohm load.  Here is the output power in stereo and 8 channels:We are meeting spec here which is good (there is some nonsense about 8000 watts peak which we forgive and ignore).All the testing so far has been resistive.  Let\\'s make the load \"reactive\" by 30 and 60 degrees angle and also sweep down to 2 ohm and see what happens:This is quite robust!  At both 4 and 8 ohms, the amp doesn\\'t care if the load is reactive or not.  At 2 ohm though, it starts to complain, dropping its output voltage by nearly half.  Testing at 1 ohm resulted in momentary shutdown.ConclusionsThe build quality of this 8-channel amplifier seems quite substantial.  Massive power supply courtesy of dual toroidal transformers powers the 8 channels well, allowing the amplifier to meet spec.  Distortion and noise are rather high though and rank well below our average.  The amplifier protection and ability to handle complex loads is excellent. You are paying almost nothing for this amplifier (the case alone could cost you this much!) yet you get way above a broken design.  The PT8000CH won\\'t be my main choice for a high-performance 2-channel system but for surround duty and certainly multi-room amplification, it seems fine.I am going to recommend the Pyle PT8000CH.  Not because it has great measured performance as far as noise and distortion.  But that it delivers way, way above its cost point.Edit: teardown is now posted: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...8000ch-multichannel-amplifier-teardown.43333/',\n",
       " \" Topping MX3 DAC, Bluetooth, Headphone Amplifier, and Power amplifier.  You even get a remote control with it. Despite all that functionality it costs just USD $130 from Amazon including Prime shipping.  I bought mine from Massdrop 10 months ago.  I don't know what I paid but likely less.From the outside, the MX3 looks quite attractive:It has the same design language as the Topping DX3 Pro but even more attractive with that slanted logo.  The volume control is digital and very sensitive.  There is a ton of functionality here which I won't go into as there is a good review of it from Z which I will post after this review.  Suffice it to say, it is very feature rich and well designed for such a bargain product.Everything is powered by an external laptop sized switching power supply:Not only is extra expense incurred in getting a Topping branded power supply, but typical of them it comes with full compliance with regulatory bodies both in US and EU.For most of my testing, I used the USB input but did give the Aux analog input a try as well.  I did not test the subwoofer out.  Not did I play with Bluetooth.If the MX3 performs, it will be the audio miracle of modern times so let's get into measurements.  But first a note: I had to take some shortcuts to get through all of this functionality.  I think it represents the missing measurements.DAC MeasurementsThere are no line outs on the MX3 so I used the headphone output set to 2 volts to get our dashboard view:Oh no! Distortion is fairly high putting the MX3 in bottom class of all DACs tested:This is quite a bit worse than any DAC Topping has produced and will set the limit for the rest of the measurements.Headphone Amplifier MeasurementsLet's start with our all important power versus distortion+noise at 300 ohm:The higher noise and distortion in the dashboard comes into play here putting the MX3 fair bit behind its look-alike, Topping DX3 Pro.  At 33 milliwatt power before clipping, there is not sufficient amount for a desktop amplifier.  Then again if you listen to the DX3 Pro in low gain, there is more power here than there.Using 33 ohm load we examine the current delivery of the headphone amplifier:Similar story here except 230 milliwatts is good amount of power for low impedance headphones.I was pleasantly surprised to see a very low output impedance in MX3:This means you can use any headphone with the MX3 and not have its frequency response change because of output impedance.Power Amplifier Audio MeasurementsOur dashboard for power amplifier calls for 5 watts of output:The amplifier is quite a bit worse than the DAC, showing a disappointing SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) of just 68 dB.  This is not performance you want to brag about to your friends:Here is the full power curve into 4 ohm load:Usually amplifiers keep reducing their THD+N as the signal gets stronger relative to noise.  Not so here.  Distortion is high enough that at just 1 watt, it starts to dominate and flattens the curve until clipping at about 30 watts.  More power can be had if you get it spike up a bit as shown so the unit meets its spec of I think 40 watts into 4 ohm.Here is the THD+N versus power versus frequency:The issue here is rising distortion in high frequencies regardless of amount of power being output.  1 kHz test tone we use in the dashboard then is almost the best case scenario.  By the way, the above test was performed with Aux input so that I could vary the input voltage as I do with other power amplifiers.Here is out signal to noise ratio:So not quite as good as CD's dynamic range.Listening TestsI only tested the headphone amplifier this way.  I will at some point start testing with speakers.With Sennheiser HD-650 high impedance headphone, there was good bit of power giving a physical sensation of bass.  Alas, by then distortion would set it and the sound would get bright and corrupted.Things changed with much lower impedance Hifiman HE-400i.  There was plenty of volume here and I had to try really hard to get it to distort.  It would do so but at levels I did not want to listen to for more than a second or two.  Bass sensation was quite good bringing the full dynamic range out of these headphones which lesser powered headphone amplifiers cannot.ConclusionsThe only bright spot in the Topping MX3 performance is its headphone amplifier especially with low impedance headphones.  Outside of that, the MX3 disappoints.  While nothing is broken and design clearly verified (Audio Precision graphs are included in the manual), the bar was set quite low to meet the price point. Is the MX3 transparent enough?  Probably for most people.  Is it transparent enough for me to recommend it?  No.  You are much better off with discrete components.  You will be paying more though to get that performance.Am I being too critical?  We had fish chips yesterday at our favorite waterfront restaurant and it cost $57 for the three of us.  Two of those meals and you can have the Topping MX3.  So the value is incredible.  Let me know what you think. \",\n",
       " ' Behringer A500 \"Reference\" Power amplifier.  I purchased this unit on suggestions from members from Amazon for just $199 including Prime shipping.Being targeted at the pro market, this is rack-mount unit with heft heatsinks on each side:Full compliment of inputs are provided from RCA to balanced XLR and TRS.  No input selector is provided though and the manual warns against simultaneous connection to more than one input.The plastic volume knobs feel cheap but otherwise, it seems to be a sturdy build.The manual says it has a class AB output stage.  I am assuming some kind of power rail voltage switching is used to keep power consumption generally low but I have not confirmed this.For my testing, I used a 4 ohm dummy load and balanced XLR inputs.  Let\\'s get into measurements and see how she did.EDIT: the first revision of this review had tested the A500 with the input switch set to bridged.  It has now been updated in proper stereo mode.MeasurementsLet\\'s start with our dashboard:Even though I was using balanced input and outputs from the amplifier, we see large contributions from noise from the power supply in the form of 120 Hz and multiple harmonics.  The harmonic distortion is quite high too with distortion spikes seemingly going on forever.  So even if the power supply was 100% quiet, it would likely still not get better distortion/sinad rating.  A dismal showing regardless, underperforming good DACs by whopping 40 db!Signal to noise ratio is rated at 100 and I get numbers reasonably close to it:Here is distortion versus power:Sad to see a class AB amp not be able to outdo the switching amp in the Topping TP60 with respect to distortion and noise where the two overlap.Thankfully the Behringer A500 has copious amount of power, producing nearly 170 watts prior to clipping.  Behringer\\'s rating is 180 watts at 1% distortion which seems like an honest rating.Frequency response is OK but not as flat as it should be for a power amp in the audible range:If there is rail supply switching, then it likely has an output filter to get rid of switching noise from that and as a result, start to roll off the response as we see above.I think we have a good picture of A500 performance so let\\'s not torture ourselves anymore.  ConclusionsWe seem to have a stream of bad luck with bargain amplifiers.  Sure, they provide exceptional value in how little they charge per watt.  I know I can\\'t make and ship the empty case of this amplifier for $199.  But still, we want good distortion specs that rise up at least to some of the worst DACs we have ever tested.  Heck, these numbers are no better than some analog formats!Given the high distortion levels and somewhat uneven frequency response, I can\\'t recommend the Behringer 500.  If you just want loud amplification, then you do have a bargain here.-----As always, any questions, concerns, comments, corrections, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating using Patreon (or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (It will enable me to pay for gear that is not offered for loan.',\n",
       " ' (vintage?) Sunfire Cinema Grand five channel power amp designed by Bob Carver. It is on kind loan from a member. In 1996 it cost US $2,375. This unit is from 1999 and has had its caps upgraded.I can\\'t say I am a fan of this look.  The meter shows an obscure measurement of the \"power supply joules.\" The dial never moves so it is useless.Back panel shows some deviations from norm as well:In addition to normal speaker terminals, the front channels also have \"current output.\"  This just means that there is a 1 ohm resistor in series with the output.  This causes voltage/power loss that is inversely proportional to the impedance of the speaker.  As such, it varies the frequency response of the speaker so can have different tonality.There is balanced XLR input which is what I used for my testing.This amplifier is the third iteration of Bob Carver.  After leaving Phase Linear, he designed the \"Magnetic Field\" amplifier under the Carver name.  That product varies the AC duty cycle as a way to change the incoming AC voltage and with it, the output DC.  This lowers the losses in the output transistors since they don\\'t have to operate for worst case (maximum power).  See my review of Carver M-1.5t amplifier.  Bob then left and started Sunfire and with it, came this amplifier design.  Instead of crudely changing the AC duty cycle, this amplifier has a DC to DC converter which tracks the incoming music.  The higher the input level, the more it will increase its output voltage, thereby keeping the output transistors in their optimal voltage level.  Result again is very high efficiency compared to normal class AB design.  Let\\'s measure it to see how well it works.BTW, there are two versions of this: one at 200 watts and one at 400 watts.  Maybe I am going blind but I could not see any designation of such on the unit. Carver Cinema Grand Amplifier MeasurementsAs with the M-15.t, I noticed a lot of noise before I fed the unit a signal so let\\'s look at that:We see that the dc to dc converter is pass through a lot of AC noise and harmonics.  This impacts the performance of the unit:While second harmonic distortion dominates at -72 dB, the mains noise is not far behind, causing SINAD (relative sum of noise+distortion) to drop further to just 67 dB.  This is ranks pretty close to the bottom of all the amplifiers tested:SNR is not good as a result of that noise:Multitone at 5 watts suffers from both power supply spikes and high intermodulation distortion:Crosstalk is surprisingly poor:There seems to be inductive leakage at frequencies below 5 kHz which I am guessing is bleed through the shared power DC to DC converter.Oddest thing was the frequency response:There is some verbiage from Bob Carver about \"voicing\" the amplifier.  Perhaps this is intentional but then why is one channel different than the other?Claim to fame here is high power capability so let\\'s see if it delivers on that:It does indeed.  At the expense of noise and distortion but still, a 37 pound amplifier of the time, with 5 channels no less, would be in no position to produce such a power.The new DC to DC converter is regulated so no headroom power:There is healthy power at 8 ohm as well:I had to lower the input level substantially to get the amp to run the frequency dependence as it would pull back severely at higher frequencies:The lines are very high in vertical scale indicating high noise and distortion which we already know about.  What we had not seen is the difficulty the amp has with high frequencies.  This is likely due to the dc to dc converter not being able to track the voltage at higher frequencies.  Fortunately music naturally has far lower level at higher frequencies so actual impact is low.Finally, the amplifier is stable from power on:Scale is heavily exaggerated with the one channel improving just 1 dB.  And the other being stable from start.ConclusionsBob seems to have gotten the \"high order bit\" right in figuring out how to produce a high efficiency, high power amplifier.  Alas, much of the talk is about fidelity and in that department, this is a poor showing.  Mains noise gets through readily and distortion is quite high even by 1996 standards.  From buying used point of view, the cool running environment of this amp means that it ages very well so the risks are lower.  Then again that dc to dc converter brings a lot more complexity to the design.Overall, the Carver Cinema Grand is not something I would recommend.  But I can see people purchasing it as a lightweight, multichannel amplifier that delivers a lot of power.  To the extent you can purchase it for a lot less than modern class D amps, it would be a decent buy.P.S. no, I don\\'t have any more carver amps to test.    Nor did I seek them out.  They just happen to become available all around the same time.',\n",

For testing, I adjusted the gain to 29 dB which is my standard for testing.Amazon Basics 80W MeasurementsAs usual, we feed the amplifier a 1 kHz tone with enough amplitude to produce 5 watts and see what we get:Well, this is not good.  Distortion (third harmonic) is quite high at around 68 dB causing the SINAD to be pretty close to the bottom of all the amps we have tested:Frequency response showed high sensitivity relative to (speaker) load:Crosstalk was horrible:How the heck they screwed this up?  The dashed line in teal is a $25 amplifier.32-tone test shows what we saw in the dashboard more or less:We can\\'t clear 16 bit content even at max power:Power curve shows early onset of distortion:At least spec is met (at 4 ohm):Sweeping with different frequencies we see distortion rises a lot with frequency:ConclusionsI am a sucker for a bargain as much as the next person.  But there comes a line that I hate to cross and this amplifier forces me to do so.  There are just so many faults here.  If you want to use it in a garage or workshop, it will be fine and run cooler than little desktop amps.  That is the only positive thing I can say about it.Needless to say, I can\\'t recommend the Amazon Basics 80 Watt amplifier.Edit: see teardown here: https://www.audiosciencereview.com/...azon-basics-80-watt-amplifier-teardown.20945/',\n",

Various inputs are provided although USB is for storage device, not as a DAC:I focused my testing on analog and Toslink inputs.Like the inclusion of power supply in the unit which likely is the reason for some of its weight.

There is strange/high noise floor plus plenty of distortion.  Perhaps it digitizes the analog input?  Let\\'s test Toslink then:Same bad results.    It ranks way at the bottom of our rankings:Can the news get worse?  Yes, it can:There is a subwoofer output so maybe this is someone\\'s idea of high pass filter!  I looked in the manual and there are no tone controls that could be responsible for this.Let me just post the rest of the graphs and not waste words on a failing design:ConclusionsThis is a prime example of what we in the industry call \"phoned in design.\"  You call up a shop in China, given them your wish list and out comes an amp.  You do no testing yourself and put no requirements as far as performance on the shop that is \"designing\" it.  Result is all the checklist items marketing wants with performance not even on the back of the priority list.  Does it sound better than a sound bar when paired with a couple of speakers?

For example you hit the \"return\" button to get into options and then rotate the number to select.  Hitting return gets you back one step but never back to home menu above.  You have to select \"Volume\" and click on that to get back home.  I had the volume too high once as soon as I changed inputs and could not turn it down immediately.When you turn the unit off with the standby button on the left, a dim display remains saying ampX.

The noise must be getting amplified proportionally with volume.32-tone test signal resembling \"music\" shows the same problems:Look at those spikes in mid frequencies rising to almost -50 dB.  This is where our hearing is starting to get most sensitive.Frequency response was terrible with digital or analog inputs:There is a high pass filter which I could not figure how to defeat so let it be at 10 Hz.  It must cause that terrible peaking at low frequencies.  Conversely, there is a sharp filter at 20 kHz which roll off starting even earlier.  We are down 3 dB by the time we get to 20 kHz.  And this is with digital input and sample rate of 96 kHz!Let\\'s test the power amp to full power starting at 4 ohm:That is a lot worse than a typical AVR.  Same is true with 8 ohm load:Thermal AnalysisPerformance improved a bit over half of running at 5 watts:ConclusionsI tell you: if manufacturers post measurements, I am sure they would have caught these issues themselves.  Even a marketing person would know the above frequency response would not sell a single unit.  But no.  Customers don\\'t ask for it so manufactures just throw a few numbers over the fence.  Those numbers did point to problems:We actually did better at 0.05%!  How they got this SNR, I don\\'t know :ConclusionsI get the appeal of \"do it all\" amplifier with modern streaming features.  But come on.  Let\\'s get the basics right.  The amp needs to be low noise and distortion and have flat response.  And spend some time make the unit easier to navigate.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Nubert nuConnect ampX.  It had high promise but did not remotely get there.',\n",
       " \" Fosi Audio BT10A Bluetooth Class D stereo amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The B10A seems to have just been updated with tone controls and sells for US $50 from Amazon with free prime shipping.This is a very small amplifier:You can't see the depth but it is quite shallow.  Other amps like this I have tested have complicated interface to change built-in digital tone controls.  There are none here so it was easy to use.The back connectors is identical to what you see on myriad of such amps:While the external laptop replacement power supply is large compared to the size of the unit, it is not as huge as some others.  Note that it comes with a three-prong, figure-8 AC socket so you have less options to replace the cord.I did not bother testing the Bluetooth.  I am assuming it autoselects it if in range as the priority input as there is no switch to select it.Speaker terminals are tiny of course but I managed to plug in my heavy and large banana jacks into it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard view of 1 kHz tone into 4 ohm load with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain (THX recommendation):Second harmonic dominates to the tune of -65 dB which sets the SINAD to the same value.  This says that noise is not a contributor to SINAD and as such, any gain setting would have produced similar SINAD.  The 65 dB SINAD value doesn't put a smile on anyone's face but it is a couple of steps above $30 units (e.g. Lepy LP-2020A):Noise figures are barely adequate:32-tone test signal shows more or less uniform distortion at all frequencies:19+20 kHz tones shows 55 dB of distortion-free range:Their full (and unrealistic) amplitude shows higher distortions than multitone test does.Frequency response shows truncated low and high frequencies:Above with a resistor load.  Subjective the amp to my new complex speaker model of a 2-way speaker generates:The speaker model has a its impedance shooting up in high frequencies causing similar issue here.  There is a question of whether the model is similar to mass of 2-way speakers so don't run with this yet.  What you can conclude is that the speaker choice does impact the speaker response.  In audible band though, the impact is minimal and in some way is correcting the dip toward 20 kHz.  A good amp would have no speaker load dependency.Let's see how much power the BT10A can produce into 4 ohm load:At 33 watts with both channels driven this is good bit of power.  Similar story with 8 ohm load:Lack of power is by far the #1 issue in these amplifiers.  You may not be able to hear their noise and distortions but you absolutely will hear them complain when they clip.  At these power levels you should have a reasonable experience unlike some other budget amps that stop at 10 watts or so.Allowing for more distortion (1% THD+N) and testing with a short-term sinewave and long term produces identical numbers:The input power supply is regulated so there is no reservoir to provide short-term juice. Thermal StabilityPerformance gradually improved by a 2 dB or so after 30 minutes of playing at 5 watts:Above tests were performed after this warm-up period.ConclusionsThe Fosi Audio BT10A doesn't seem half bad.  I am not going to provide a verdict one way or the other.  You can decide for yourself if the performance is good enough for your application.\",\n",
       " ' Audio Research Corporation (ARC) 100.2 stereo power amplifier.  It is on kind loan from a member.  The 100.2 came out in year 1998 at a cost of US $2,995.  It was later raised to US $3,495.  If I remember correctly, the owner told me this the last solid state amplifier ARC produces before going to all tube route.The 100.2 is as solid as a rock:The back panel is as you expect with the exception of (custom?) speaker binding posts:In use the 100.2 cooked and cooked good.  I measured 45 to 47 degrees C on the heatsinks.  The internal temps are likely much higher.  I read that it uses unobtanium output MOSFET transistors so if they go, you likely have a giant door stop.    In use though the 100.2 did not complain one bit and ran through all of my tests.Strangely when you power the unit down, it takes it a while to do that.  What it is doing, I don\\'t know.The design of the unit is based on low feedback factor of just 6 dB.  Based on that alone I can tell you it is not going to perform well.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsWe have huge power supply peaks, like due to poor power supply rejection ratio of low feedback design.  Second and third harmonic dominate the distortion profile resulting in lackluster SINAD of just 65 dB.  That lands the ARC 100.2 near the bottom of some 72 amplifiers tested so far:Frequency response is excellent:Response changes some with a simulated 2-way speaker load but nothing to cry over:Multitone test shows the high distortion products of the power supply:And rather high noise floor which we can directly measure using signal to noise ratio:Crosstalk shape is odd but not an audible concern:Amplifier Power MeasurementsThe sins of low feedback factor stare at you in the face with our 4 ohm load:Yes, distortion gradually increases but then it clips anyway.  So why not have clean power until clipping???Same deal into 8 ohms:At least it slightly exceeds its power specifications.Strangely burst power (momentary peaks) doesn\\'t generate much more power:Keeping THD+N constant at 0.1% gives us incredibly low and strange amount of power:There is so much distortion and noise in the output of this amp that you don\\'t get much power if you set your goal at 0.1% THD (likely threshold of audibility for some people).  FYI I ran the above at 0.2% THD+N (not shown) and it produced about 80 watts with a straight line.  Anyway, who says only class D amps have trouble with this test?Amplifier Thermal stabilityI powered the unit cold and let it run nearly half hour while recording distortion and noise. This is what I got:That is very high degree of improvement.  Again, low feedback means that it is more sensitive to operating temperature.  Given the high heat dissipation, it is a tough deal to have to also keep the unit on for a while to get the best performance.ConclusionsSigh.  The best analogy I can think of here is if car owners said, \"you know, a car should have more square tires\" and manufacturers running to build cars that way.  Yes, audio folklore says feedback is a bad thing.  Well, I have news for you: distortion is really, really bad thing.  As is noise.  It surely doesn\\'t give you \"blacker background\" if it has higher noise, does it?I read some place that it has less feedback so it can deliver less phase shift.  Do folks not know that you have reflections in your room, every one of which arrives at your ears with a different delay and hence phase?  That they all mix up and as a result, the brain discards that info?  If it did not, we would go crazy trying to make sense of people talking to us in indoor situations.  Anyway, we digress.Needless to say, I cannot recommend the ARC 100.2.  Serviceability will be poor and so will the performance.',\n",

My back is still complaining....There is no benefit to having a differential power amplifier but seems like they a pair of amps are used out of phase to double the power per channel:The switchmode power supply changes supply rail on (power demand) to keep power consumption low at lower power levels (\"class H\").  In my testing, the DR2 barely got warm so the mechanism is working.Emotiva XPA-DR2 MeasurementsI was expecting good measurements but instead got this:Wow, look at the harmonic spray starting at third one.  SINAD of 64 dB ranks almost at the bottom of nearly 150 amplifiers tested:Not good.Fortunately signal to noise ratio is excellent so this is a quiet amplifier:Frequency response and crosstalk are fine:Multitone test though shows the high distortion across the frequency band:The main meal here is power into 4 and 8 ohm loads versus distortion+noise:That\\'s incredible amount of power.  Alas it is delivered with lots of distortion.  Back to the power, check out the max and peak power:And this is on a shared 20 amp 120 volt outlet.  I don\\'t think we have measured any other amplifier that comes close to this level of output.Similar story holds (good and bad) for 8 ohm:As you see the curve looks nothing like other amplifiers where they are first noise limited until clipping sets in.  Here, distortion is front and center even at 50 milliwatts!We get a look at the architecture of this amplifier by sweeping power at different frequencies:We have a constant glitch around 20 to 50 watts which I am assuming is the amplifier switching rails to higher voltage.  We also have rising distortion as seen in the previous graphs even at low power.ConclusionsAssuming I don\\'t have to carry it much, I love the build and great value as far as $/watt and maximum amount of power available.  SNR is also good so you should be free of speaker hiss.  Distortion is high though and there is no getting around it.  Will you hear it?  At 60 dB it is probably borderline for most people.I can\\'t recommend the Emotiva XPA-DR2 due to its high distortion.  Otherwise, it is a very tempting package.',\n",
       " \"A member asked me a while ago to test the ultra cheap ($18) UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier on Amazon. To make the clickbait title work , I omitted the cost of the external power supply you need to bring yourself. What you get is a three board assembly:It took less than 5 minutes to put the heatsink on the main class D amp chip and sandwich the main board with the top and bottom.  The chip used must be for smart speakers as it has voice prompts when you change inputs.  Speaking of that, it has Bluetooth (which I did not test), analog and USB in.  The little heatsink has no air flow and in testing, it got quite hot to touch at times.For testing, I used my lab power supply and set the output voltage to 24 volts (max spec).  The supply has  3 Amps max current.  Amplifier is rated for dual 50 watts at that voltage input.UWAYKEY Mini Bluetooth Amplifier MeasurementsI started testing with analog input with volume adjusted for 29 dB gain:Considering the price, this is not half bad:I kludged up a USB type A to type A cable and ran the dashboard test again:As you see performance is not as good as analog input.  Worse yet, just a few seconds later, it lost stability and would no longer work reliably.  If I powered it down, it would work for a second or two and then go crazy again. It may be a design issue or my setup.  Either way, I could only continue with analog input testing.Noise floor is high as you can see in the FFT graphs above:Crosstalk managed to be worse than the worst I have tested so far:Multitone shows increased distortion at both ends of the spectrum:The most important test for class D amps shows strong load dependency:So the tonality you get will depend on speaker you hook up to it.As usual, we fall way short of stated power levels:8 Ohm performance was a bit better:Response vs frequency is smooth but that may be due to high noise floor which masks distortion:Amplifier Listening TestsI hooked up one channel to my Infinity Reference 253 speaker and starting to listen.  There was a lot more power than I expectedly, likely due to only having to drive one channel.  The sound was surprisingly good until you cranked it to max volume.  Speaking of which, if I paused input, the last 25% of the volume range produced tweeter hiss that was audible to about 1 meter/3 feet.I was very satisfied with subjective performance until I landed on two clips, both of which were busy with both bass and treble notes.  On these two tracks, the sound was very distorted at almost all volume levels.  High frequencies would get gritty and distorted and bass response was bad as well.  I power cycled the unit and let it cool and it seemed to play well for a couple of seconds and then would get distorted.  It may be that the crest factor is too low causing the amp to drive hard most of the time with these two tracks.  And then it overheats and distorts.ConclusionsThe first amplifier I ever built (with my brother when we were 10 or 11 years old) was this massive board and produced only 10 watts a channel.  It also cost us many months of allowance.  Compare that to this amplifier which for the price of a fast food meal for two, gives you stereo sound that most of the time is impressively good.  If it did not distort on those two channels, I would say you could build an amp with two of them and be in business.Given the distortion/heat issue, I can't recommend the UWAYKEY amplifier.\",\n",

That distortion curve is crazy.  It almost act like a tube amp or something!  Distortion is so high when it clips that when we measure at 1%, we actually get less power:Switching to 8 ohm doesn't help:Sweeping the frequencies we see this pronounced hump:So my guess is that it is a class G design but company says Class D.ConclusionsThe distortion in this amplifier is just out of control.  It is also not every powerful on a per channel basis.  So I don't see it having a good application for home use in either main or sub amplifier.  It is also expensive so I don't see the value in it either.

Back panel is typical with the exception of crossing terminals (for bridging):12 volt trigger is icing on the cake.Unit runs is a \"class J\" amplifier and was cool and comfortable during testing.  Amplifier MeasurementsHere is our usual dashboard:We have massive mains spike which I could hardly reduce no matter what I did.  I am assuming it is internal leakage.

I don\\'t know anyone who is building class B audio amplifiers.Unlike some of the switching amplifiers from Crown, this is a class AB amplifier with seemingly linear power supply as it is quite heavy.  From the outside though, it look like countless other commercial amplifiers:There are two gain controls in addition to very useful clipping indicators.  Speaking of clipping, there is a compressor in there that limits power output to maximum no matter how much you increase its input.  It is a nice feature that is surely there to stop the amp from stressing while saving a speaker from blowing up due to a mistake upstream.The back panel is as you expect:In use the unit never even got warm.  I had headphones on so did not take note of when/if the fans came on.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s see how the XLi 800 does in our usual dashboard at 5 watt output into 4 ohm using a 1 kHz tone:Ouch!  We have very high distortion of 0.13 to 0.16%.  The spec is 0.5% so it is within what they say but this is very high.  Translated into SINAD (signal over noise and distortion) our 57 dB value sinks into the bottom range of all amplifiers measured so far:Signal to noise ratio at 5 watt is nothing to write home about either:Frequency response is fairly flat and predictable:Power into 4 ohm relative to THD+N gives us:That is a lot of power.  And tremendous value at just 50 cents per watt. As one would predict, we lose some of that into 8 ohm:Determining maximum power and peak with 1% THD+N gives us these:We have fair bit of headroom there.I had a hard time measuring power across full spectrum at a given THD+N due to the amp limiting power (and hence distortion).  Only managed to capture 0.9% and 0.5% THD+N power here:As we would expect, we get less power at low frequencies because they tax the power supply more.  Oh, the text on graph is wrong: should say 1% not 0.1%.Finally, here is our frequency sensitivity relative to power and distortion+noise:Best distortion is usually at lower frequencies and here, the improvement is quite good at 20 Hz.  Alas, we also get less power before clipping (orange).Otherwise, the lines are quite predictable with no funny non-linearity mid span as we get with some amplifiers.ConclusionsCrown advertises the XLi 800 as a PA (Public Address) amplifier and that is what it is.  Distortion and noise is kept in check just enough to do the job with tons of power for so little money.  I suspect it is reliably too given the dual fans to keep it cool.  And the market it is being sold into.For hi-fi use, it is not something I would consider to drive full-range speakers.  For subwoofer or active woofer duty, it would be fine.As it is, I can\\'t recommend the XLi 800.',\n",

Strangely if I squint, the fuzzy picture on SMSL website shows the other power supply.As you see, you have both digital and analog inputs.  I tested both as you see below.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsLet\\'s start with analog input performance:Well, that is not good.  One channel is producing far more distortion.  And noise level is quite high.  Switching to USB input improves the good channel significantly:The bad channel is insisting on producing far more distortion.  Averaging the two, we get a SINAD score that is pretty much at the bottom of our rankings:From here on, I stuck with USB input since it performs better.  Frequency response was refreshingly good:Power into 4 ohm load shows poor response:Doesn\\'t get much better into 8 ohm:And we are way off the spec.  But that is typical.  Or maybe it needs the higher voltage power supply.Thermal stabilityNot much was changing after power up:ConclusionsIt is one thing to have random performance when an amp is $50 or so.

No, there is no typo in there. It weights 40 pounds/18 KG so it does have some meat to it.  You can probably see the bolt that holds the power transformer on top left. So no switching power supply at least.  Back panel shows nice sub out option:The fan is variable speed and is mostly quiet at idle.  But even under modest power it spools up as temps climb, making a slightly whining sound:The front controls are analog actually but notched, making it harder to select an exact value.  They are out of sync with each other so one notch is not the same as the other.  The displayed amount is also off by a couple of dB (27 dB shown above was actually 29 dB).  There is a built-in limiter and clipping light.Rockville RPA16 MeasurementsLet\\'s jump right in with our dashboard:That is very odd set of spikes in low frequencies.  We have the mains 60 Hz noise but also 70 Hz.  At this power level though, spray of distortion at -62 dB sets SINAD though, causing it to rank as one of the worse tested:Its score of 55 dB is so low that it pulled down our overall median by 1 dB to 78!Signal to noise ratio is poor at 5 watts, likely due to that power supply noise.  But there is so much power that when you push it, the ratio is not bad:Multitone test shows that distortion naturally gets worse at higher frequencies:Frequency response is nice and load independent indicating a non-switching amplifier:You have a choice of two roll offs for sub output.  Strangely both boost the gain as well:Let\\'s see how accurate the power specs are (2 X 1500 watts at 4 ohm):Naturally we don\\'t get there but this is one powerful amplifier, generating nearly 1500 watts with both channels combined.Letting distortion go up and with shorter term signal we get even more of it:I don\\'t think we have measured this much power before, have we?Even at 8 ohm you have a ton of power:As noted though, noise floor is high, again, I think the worst measured.  Distortion actually doesn\\'t set in until 100+ watts.Checking for frequency vs power and distortion we see orderly response:If you are using it for sub, you want to use the above number, rather than the 1 kHz power tests shown earlier.  Fortunately this is still a ton of power considering dual channels are driven.Finally, I ran a wideband spectrum test to confirm the design is not switching:And it is not.  There is also good filtering to push the noise levels down so low above a few hundred kilohertz. ConclusionsThis is an interesting take on a pro amplifier to go with non-switching design.  This makes the amp extremely heavy compared to competition yet, the price is maintained and absurdly low.  Copious amount of power is available if you can tolerate some fan noise.Due to high level of noise I can\\'t recommend the Rockville RPA16.  But you are welcome to choose otherwise based on other factors.',\n",
       " ' Carver M-1.5t vintage stereo amplifier. It was kindly sent to me by a member.The M-1.5t came in an era where rack mounting meant serious business. As a Carver (receiver) owner myself, I remember all the advertising for the M-1.5t.  Oddly, there is no power switch anywhere:I got a chuckle seeing that monster cable tag:And found the power specs ridiculously complicated but I am sure was appreciated by the aficionadas of the amp:The front LEDs don\\'t light up until it is putting out a lot of power.  I liked the top LED which was the limiting lights and nice protection circuit which kept the unit on no matter what.  This amp was part of Carver \"Magnetic Field\" amplification line which varied the power supply voltage to substantially reduce the size and weight of the transformer.  As a result, the unit ran quite cool, maybe a bit warmer than modern class D but still, impressive for the time.The owner has replaced the capacitors in this unit.  Otherwise I think it is untouched.Carver M-1.5t MeasurementsI can see why there is no power switch as the amp did not stabilize for the 14 minutes I measured it:The level of instability is quite large, going beyond 10 db variation in SINAD!  I am used to seeing 1 or 2 dB, but nothing at this level.When I had the unit connected, and before I fed it signal, I could see constant switching noise:Not sure what that is about.  Here is our dashboard at 5 watts with 1 kHz tone:Third harmonic dominates distortion profile and with it, SINAD (relative sum of noise+distortion).  Average SINAD of 55 dB for both channels is far, far below that median for all amplifiers I have tested to date (around 79 dB).  On top of distortion, we have massive pulse train which oddly starts at 40 Hz.  So definitely not very clean.SNR though was better:Frequency response was nice, flat and extended:Crosstalk was \"OK:\"Multitone shows more than usual increase in distortion vs frequency:Front of the unit says it has low feedback which is likely responsible for this.Claim to fame is lots of power so let\\'s see how it does:We see a distinct jump in distortion at around 66 watts which must be when it switches to higher power supply voltage.  Allowing for copious amount of distortion, there is good bit of power at 273 watts.  Here is the same at 8 ohm:Now let\\'s test peak performance:There definitely is a lot of headroom, allowing power to almost double!  The 600 watt number and such must have been at higher distortion levels than what I allow.Testing for frequency sensitivity we again see the higher distortion at higher frequencies:20 Hz performance also dropped with rising distortion at just 20 watts.Finally, here is the ultrasonic spectrum:ConclusionsIt is nice to test products that were iconic during my youth with state of the art measurements that didn\\'t even exist then.  Using that, we see that in noise and distortion the M-1.5t is outgunned by vast number of amplifiers today.  However, it produces copious amount of power which would have been even more impressive then.  The efficiency rivals class D amps today which was unheard of at the time.Looking online, I see that non-upgraded but working units go for $500 or so.  They seem to be a decent alternative to pro class D amp if you have a soft spot in your heart for vintage amplifiers.  ',\n",

The SA100 costs just US $73.99 on Amazon including shipping.Form the outside the SA100 matches its sibling, the M100 DAC:Pushing the power button multiple times lets you select between Aux RCA in and Bluetooth.  Pushing and holding the volume control lets you select Bass and Treble amounts.  I was surprised that the unit had shipped with both set to max instead of zero.The volume control works well and overall, you feel like you are getting more than the $74 price indicates.Here is the back panel:An external \"laptop style\" switching supply powers the unit.  It is almost as large as the SA100 itself although not as thick.I was pleased that my rather large and unwieldy banana speakers securely mated with the jacks on the SA100.Overall, my impression is positive about the look and feel of this little, and I mean little, integrated amplifier.The heart of the unit is TPA3116D2  class-D amplifier IC from Texas Instruments.  I suspect it is made for Bluetooth speakers and such.  In use the SA100 ran cool no matter how hard I pushed it.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard of a 1 kHz tone at 5 watts into 4 ohm load:As is typical of amplifiers with volume control, one can get slightly different results depending on how you set the input level relative to volume control on the unit itself.  The above is with volume control set to -1 I think.High distortion dominates the output resulting in one of the worst numbers we have measured with respect to SINAD (noise+distortion relative to main signal):Frequency response droops at both end some:The sharp drop after 20 kHz tells me that input is perhaps digitized to provide tone control?Signal to noise ratio \"OK\" for the class:Measuring distortion and noise relative to output power with 8 and 4 ohm gets us:Distortion sets it very early and climbs after that.  Specified power ratings are quite inflated as is typical of these chip amps.The sharp filter limit the measurement of harmonic distortion when we sweep frequency and power level:The red curve for example is for 20 kHz but since we can\\'t see any of its harmonics, it looks artificially low.Here is the spectrum of a 1 kHz tone without any kind of filter (the above had filters):Speaking of filter, even though I used an AES-17 filter to get rid of ultrasonic noise, the level was still so high as to confuse my Audio Precision analyzer.  It would often not be able to capture the input signal properly.ConclusionsIf we measured the SMSL SA100 on an absolute level, it would rank horribly of course.  But I don\\'t think that is proper here.  The SA100 costs so little and probably gets use in tertiary applications such as a workshop amp to drive cheap speakers you don\\'t mind getting stolen or destroyed.

Worried, I looked around and it had come out of its box and was just floating in the larger box that they all came in.Prior to installation of tubes I had something to investigate: there was clearly something loose in there, rattling around.  So I took the back panel off to find a metal screw rolling around in there:Not sure where it was supposed to go.  There is a hole for something above the second fuse from the bottom but I think that would for a nut.I did not like lack of safety (earth) ground from the IEC terminal:Instead, there is some kind of local, star grounding referenced to neutral using a resistor.  That naturally won\\'t work for safety purposes.  With that power supply board mounted vertically with voltages as high as 300+ volts, I sure as heck would want this metal case grounded.  I don\\'t care what audio/electrical problem they were trying to solve there.  I want a safe product first and foremost.  Naturally there is no safety/regulatory certification which I expect a company with the name \"Carver\" to be able to afford.I got a kick out of the beefy speaker terminals but ultra-thin wires leading to it!  Yes, the lengths are short and at this wattage is probably fine but from \"optics\" point of view, you would want to use something better than hair thin wiring (see gray and red wires).I was sad to see the VU meter glued to the case:I realize welding a couple of threaded stand-offs to the case costs money but at this price, I expect such.  The meter is not backlit which was another disappointment.  But was useful for checking bias which was right at the spec at 100 milliamps.So nice looks but under the skin, a number of concerns.Carver Crimson 275 MeasurementsI usually let amplifiers warm up some and watch their behavior and also let things stabilize before measurements.  Manual states that bias can be checked after 20 minutes so I let it run for that long and a bit more:Note that the vertical scale is only 3 dB so don\\'t be alarmed by the variations.  Generally speaking, unit is table after a couple of minutes of warm up. But it is fascinating to see performance gradually get worse as it kept warming up (again, at micro level).So next comes our usual dashboard.  My Audio Precision analyzer by default has floating (non-earth connected) RCA terminals.  But I had to override that by grounding it as I observed oscillations (frequent occurrence with some amplifiers).  No other attempt at grounding made a difference in power supply/mains hum:The power supply noise really dirties up the FFT spectrum but looking past that, we see that the low SINAD (sum of noise and distortion) is dominated by distortion.  Unlike the common reputation for tubes, distortion is third harmonic for the most part, not second.  Naturally the high level of distortion places the 275 very low in our scale, second only to one other amp ever tested:Company spec is quite good for noise level relative to full power.  I could not get that without a-weighting:But applying the a-weighting filter and with it, getting rid of power supply noise, we do essentially get there:Crosstalk was poor:Frequency response has an odd shape and good bit of loss at high frequencies with 4 ohm load:Output impedance is high enough that is combining with the load to change the high frequency roll off.  Things get better as such with an 8 ohm load:There is an RC filter on the speaker terminals.  Wonder if that is what is providing the roll off.Using 32 tones to simulate \"music\" we see a high level of \"grass\" which would obscure any low level detail:Notice how the worse performance is in low frequencies.There has been controversy regarding ability of the 275 to produce its rated power of 75 watts so let\\'s start with 4 ohm load as I usually do:The amplifier produced 29 watts after which it blew its 3 amp mains fuse.  Fortunately two spares were provided, allowing me to continue testing.  Company specs distortion at \"less than 1%\" so let\\'s see power at that rating:Very dramatic difference between 1 or 2 second power (used for left side) vs short bursts.  There is clearly a capacity problem to produce sustained power.  Note that this is at 1 kHz as is industry convention.  Note that allowing just 1% THD reduces the power even more than what I allowed in my power sweep.I was surprised to not see selectable output impedance for 8 ohm load so proceed with the test as is:We blew the second fuse but now power is much more healthy at 60 watts.Hoping to not blow the last fuse, I kept the max power level lower as I changed frequencies:Performance was \"reasonable\" (for at tube) but once we got down to 20 Hz, it became super erratic and blew the third fuse.   It produced only 14 wats which is well short of 30 watts it produced at higher frequencies.  I would have wanted to test at more frequencies but it was past midnight and I did not feel like hunting around to find my own replacement fuses.ConclusionsAs a Carver owner of 40 years (solid state), I have a soft spot for the designer.  Alas, while I like some things about this amp like the nice looking paint, I am very disappointed in the QC and construction of the unit with respect to safety.  Loose screws and glued meters should not be part of a nears $3,000 amplifier.  Measured performance is awful of course and one would expect that for many audiophile tube amps.  But having third harmonic be dominant blows away the story of why that is audibly a good thing.  Clearly the specifications of the amplifier is incorrect for 4 ohm load (company even allows usage for 2 ohm loads!).  And low frequency behavior is very poor.Unless you are going to buy the Carver Crimson 275 to just look at it, I can\\'t recommend it for many reasons stated above.  I expect more from the man, the legend....P.S. It was nice to take a break from drying up our flooded home and get back to some \"normalcy\" with testing this amp.  It cheered me up to be \"working\" again and doing what I enjoy.EDIT: We have had two formal responses from Bob Carver:Carver Crimson 275 Review (Tube Amp)What baffles me is that to make this amp safe and hum free doesn’t take much effort.

       " ' Carver Raven 350 tube monoblock amplifier. It is on kind loan from a member and (I think) costs US $4,750.The 350 is not a bad looking amp. It has the same \"orange peel\" paint job of the previous Carver 275 amplifier I reviewed.  At 42 pounds, the unit is pretty heavy.  With all the weight in the back, the front handle is kind of useless when it comes to lifting it.There is an XLR input but I believe it is for convenience and performs the same as RCA. I measured the DC resistance of the 4 and 8 ohm terminals (after the measurements) and realized they are both the same!  Here I was switching back and forth between them.   Anyway, measured DC resistance is 0.47 ohm. The 1-2 ohm tap has a lower DC resistance of about 0.3 ohm.Unlike the 275 amplifier, the fuses did not blow and the amp survived my sweep tests.  Bias is to be set at \"80\" on the front dial and that was the case when I powered on the unit.There is a gain control but you are advised to set it to max which is what I did for testing.There is a flip switch in the front which changes the amount of feedback.  I tested the amp in both settings.Here are the specs:Carver 350 MeasurementsLet\\'s start with high-feedback performance using XLR input:There is copious amount of distortion causing SINAD to be dominated by it.  At 44.1, it ranks as the second worst amplifier ever tested:It even performed worse than the Carver 275 which had a SINAD of 46.  Switching to lower feedback doesn\\'t make things that much worse:Note that gain is reduced and therefore, volume will be different. This makes AB testing tricky.  Here is a more detailed FFT showing the small difference between low and high feedback:Notice how distortion is made up of both 2nd and 3rd harmonics so you can\\'t make the argument that it is \"2nd harmonic goodness.\"As noted, RCA performance is the same as XLR:Power supply 60 Hz noise in both cases causes severe intermodulation higher up in frequency. No amount of grounding impacted that so it is endemic tot he design.Noise performance is decent for type of amp it is:Intermodulation distortion rears its ugly head again in multitone test:I don\\'t know how anyone could hear more \"detail\" with such an amp where so much of the music signal will get lost in the distortion \"grass.\"Frequency response should be flat but it is not:It naturally will have load dependency due to output impedance.Let\\'s see the power situation as we had serious shortfall in the 275 amp:We don\\'t meet the spec there but come closer with 8 ohm:Back to 4 ohm, here is our 1% THD (double the company spec) max and burst power:We seem to get the same shortfall.  There is momentary reservoir though allowing the peak output to shoot way up.  This was not always consistent though.I also tested 2 ohm capability:You are still current limited so no more power.Changing the test frequency gives us the following power curves:There is some instability at 20 Hz and fairly significant power drop.  This points to power supply not having enough capacity as the lower frequency taxes it for longer period.  Some drop occurs in every amplifier by the way so it is a matter of how much.Finally, the amplifier warms up quickly and is pretty stable:Testing occurred after this warm up.ConclusionsWhat an upside down the world of audio is. Folks want to pay so much more to get dirtier sound.  You want dirty?  The Carver 350 gives it to you. Even at 5 watts there is copious amount of harmonic distortion.  Power supply mixes with that at such high level that it creates its own spread of distortion. A video must come with these amps that hypnotizes you into thinking you are getting great sound....I can\\'t recommend the Carver 350 monoblock amplifier.',\n",
       " ' Pass ACA Class A stereo power amplifier.  It is a DIY design by the famous designer, Nelson Pass, meant to be starter amplifier for people new to audio electronics to build.  There are many kits available. The one loaned to me from a long time friend of the forum.  The kit seems to cost around US $320 or so.The ACA sample I received comes in an attractive black case:The design is a Mosfet output stage with a single stage buffer.  Very modest level of feedback (9 dB?) is provided to keep distortion somewhat under control.  As you will see, the gain is very low requiring full 2 volt of DACs to drive it to max power.Here is the back side:I did not mess with it but I am assuming the single XLR allows bridged mono operation.Power is provided by a very beefy external switching power supply which outputs 24 volts with up to 5 amps or 120 watts.  All of that is put to \"use\" in generating copious amount of heat.  I was told by the owner to let it warm up for a few minutes.  As you will see in the measurements, this actually made the performance worse, not better.Overall, this is a very nice package if it performs.Amplifier Audio MeasurementsAs usual, we start with our dashboard with 5 watt output into 4 ohm.  Normally this is well below the max power but not in this case as we see later:Gosh... What happened to aiming for high fidelity?  This is a distortion-factory if there ever was one.  The notion that it is mostly second harmonic does not hold true either.  Welcome to the bottom of our amplifier ratings:Let\\'s dig into distortion spectrum at lower power level of just 1 watt:Second harmonic is more dominant than at 5 watt but it doesn\\'t stay there that long.  Here it is at 2 watts:Our 32-tone signal resembling \"music\" paints an ugly picture as a result:I was pleasantly surprised how quiet the unit is though:Frequency response is also very well extended:You may be able to make an AM radio out of this thing.  Back to ugliness, here is our power versus distortion+noise into 8 ohm load:Oh gosh again.... Only 7 watts of power with SINAD of 38 dB?Things don\\'t get much better with 4 ohm load:We now have distortion climbing into near 10% category at max power of just 7.4 watts/channel.There was little variation of response with respect to frequency:Distortion level is so high that it is masking secondary sources of it.Making sure this unit matches the reference, I compared them to what Nelson Pass has published:We are getting very good agreement.  So this is what the unit is supposed to do.  Nelson stays with 1 watt output which shows the performance to be better.EDIT: I noted on the dashboard that the gain was much lower than the spec.  I am told that version 1.6 which I tested now has a spec of 10 dB for gain so we are good.EDIT 2: See this link for bridged mode measurements: TestsIs this thing on?  That is the expression that immediately came to mind after I hooked up the ACA amp to my Sonus Faber Concertino bookshelf speaker. Granted, the Concertino is spec\\'ed at 86 dB efficiency but come on, I could barely hear it.  There was no bass naturally. But not much above that either.  And this was with my Topping DX3 Pro at full volume.For grins, I plugged the US $74 tiny little SMSL SA100 Amplifier which I recently reviewed  into the setup.  Now the speakers came alive, with lots of bass, great dynamic range, and detail.  Yes, the amp started to cry when I turned it up much but until that point, it left the ACA so far in the dust it was not even funny.ConclusionsAs a starter hobby amplifier to get some sound coming out of a speaker, with relatively few components, the Pass ACA Class A Amp does the job.  Build it, have fun with it and then put it aside and get a proper amplifier.  Amplifiers need to have a lot more power.  And much less distortion.  We are not even close here folks.Do I need to tell you that I can\\'t recommend the Pass ACA for hi-fi listening?  I hope not.']"
