       "' Primare A358  As the A358 has classD output stages all measurements other than frequency response were taken with Audio Precisions auxiliary AUX0025 passive lowpass filter which mitigates noise above 80kHz and eliminates noise above 200kHz  Without the filter 325mV of ultrasonic noise was present at each pair of loudspeaker terminals with a center frequency of 396kHz Because the AUX0025 filter is a twochannel device I could only measure two of the Primares eight channels at a time Almost all the measured performance was taken from channels 6 and 8 with the bridgedmode tests performed with channels 5 and 6 linked and channels 7 and 8 linked I dont precondition classD amplifiers before testing but after an hours operation the top panels temperature had stabilized at a warm 1022°F As with Primares twochannel A352 that Herb Reichert reviewed in May 2020 the A358s balanced inputs offered 6dB lower voltage gain into 8 ohms than the singleended inputs at 1995dB compared with 2595dB  The voltage gains in bridged mode were identical but they were exactly 6dB higher in bridged 6 mode The amplifier preserved absolute polarity  with both balanced and unbalanced input signals in both normal and bridged modes The balanced input impedance was close to the specified 36k ohms from 20Hz to 20kHz The unbalanced input impedance specified as 15k ohms was 147k ohms at low and middle frequencies dropping slightly and inconsequentially to 1325k ohms at the top of the audiobandIncluding the series impedance of 6 of spacedpair loudspeaker cable the A358s output impedance in normal mode was a very low 0078 ohm at 20Hz and 1kHz rising slightly to 0092 ohm at 20kHz Bridged mode increased these impedances only slightly The modulation of the amplifiers frequency response due to the Ohms law interaction between this source impedance and the impedance of our standard simulated loudspeaker was minimal at ±01dB  The response into an 8 ohm resistive load  taken without the Audio Precision lowpass filter was flat almost to 20kHz with then a rolloff of 1dB at 30kHz Unusually the ultrasonic rolloff was disturbed by resonant peaks at 60kHz and 100kHz The Primares reproduction of a 10kHz squarewave  taken with the Audio Precision lowpass filter so that the waveform was not obscured by ultrasonic noise was clean without any ringing on the tops and bottom and with minimal overshootFig1 Primare A358 frequency response at 283V into simulated loudspeaker load  8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms  Fig2 Primare A358 smallsignal 10kHz squarewave into 8 ohmsSeparation between adjacent channels was excellent at 100dB in both directions below 1kHz reducing to a still good 76dB at the top of the audioband Measured with the unbalanced inputs shorted to ground and with the auxiliary lowpass filter in circuit the amplifiers unweighted wideband signalnoise ratio was a good 74dB ref 1W into 8 ohms This ratio improved to a superb 96dB when I restricted the measurement bandwidth to the audioband and to 986dB when the reading was Aweighted Lowlevel spuriae at the 60Hz power supply frequency and its harmonics were absent from the Primares lowfrequency noisefloor Fig3 Primare A358 spectrum of 1kHz sinewave DC–1kHz at 1W into 8 ohms Primare specifies the A358s maximum power as 150W into 8 ohms and 300W into 4 ohms both equivalent to 2176dBW Using our definition of clipping which is when the outputs percentage of THDnoise reaches 1 the Primare exceeded its specified power with two channels driven into 8 ohms clipping at 200Wpc  With two channels driven into 4 ohms the A358 clipped at the specified 300Wpc  Again with two channels operating but in bridged mode the Primare clipped at 730W into 8 ohms  just below the specified 740W into this load In bridged mode into 4 ohms the clipping power was 1kW  compared with the specified 750WFig4 Primare A358 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsFig5 Primare A358 distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 4 ohmsFig6 Primare A358 bridged mode distortion  vs 1kHz continuous output power into 8 ohmsI examined how the percentage of THDnoise changed with frequency in normal mode at 20V which is equivalent to 50W into 8 ohms 100W into 4 ohms and 200W into 2 ohms The THDN was very low in the midrange into 8 4 and 2 ohms  but rose in the top octave Peculiarly with each channel driven separately the THDN was lower in the midrange and below into 2 ohms  than it was into 4 ohms Fig7 Primare A358 THDN  vs frequency at 20V into 8 ohms  4 ohms  2 ohms The A358s distortion at 50W into 8 ohms was very low and predominantly the third harmonic  though bursts of HF noise coincide with the waveform peaks even with the Audio Precision auxiliary filter in circuit The third harmonic lay at a very low –108dB  in channel 8  –103dB  in channel 6  with the second harmonic close to 10dB lower in level in both channels In bridged mode at the same power into 8 ohms  the third harmonic lay at the same –103dB but the second and fifth harmonics were about 10dB higher in level than they had been in normal mode With an equal mix of 19 and 20kHz tones at 100W into 4 ohms  while highorder intermodulation products lay at or below –94dB  the secondorder difference product at 1kHz lay below –110dB  This spectrum was taken in normal mode The intermodulation distortion was similar in bridged modeFig8 Primare A358 channel 8 1kHz waveform at 50W into 8 ohms 00049 THDN  distortion and noise waveform with fundamental notched out Fig9 Primare A358 spectrum of 50Hz sinewave DC–1kHz at

Primare A358 offers high power especially in bridged mode with very low levels of distortion and audioband noise      '"
