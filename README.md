# Audio-equipment-review-s-dataset
Large reviews dataset with specs from multiply sources: (https://www.audiosciencereview.com/ ,https://reference-audio-analyzer.pro/en/hp-fr14.php#gsc.tab=0 , https://www.stereophile.com/)  
Good for test Semantic search library for example.

Biggest dataset with reviews: all_amp.csv (this dataset include only devices with exesting reviews for them).
*All "ASR" dataset has reviews section as well for speakers and headphones.
*Raa(reference-audio-analyzer) datasets include only specs, but contains largest database.

#Review section was a little bit cleaned from special tags and characters, but still not perfect.
